      "The U.S. State Department's revelation that it has revoked visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is the latest indication that the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make public points",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the United States revokes someone's visa, it is typically confidential, with few exceptions. But with British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan and others, the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make a public point when it deems a case particularly egregious.",
      "The State Department\u2019s number two diplomat made headlines when he posted a social media message this week saying visas for the band for an upcoming U.S. tour had been revoked. British police are investigating whether a crime was committed when the duo's frontman led the audience in chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces \u2014 at a music festival in the U.K.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that their visas had been revoked \u201cin light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\u201d",
      "The band rejected claims of antisemitism and said in a statement that it was being \u201ctargeted for speaking up\u201d about the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and certain statutes related to the privacy of government documents, the State Department has for years resisted or refused to discuss specific cases in which visas may have been denied or revoked. Certain exemptions apply, such as when foreign officials and their immediate family members are found to ineligible for entry into the United States for violating anti-corruption or human rights regulations.",
      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",
      "\u201cForeigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said when asked about the public announcement.",
      "She said one reason for announcing the revocations was to make clear that the administration is serious about the standards it will apply to visa holders and applicants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about that standard, and this was a very public event that violated that very basic standard about the nature of who we want to let into the country,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Other recent cases have been less clear-cut, although some have ended up in public court cases.",
      "Earlier this year, as part of an initiative to expel foreign students who are accused by the Trump administration of engaging in pro-Hamas, anti-Israel or antisemitic activity, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had rescinded at least 300 visas and expected that number to rise.",
      "Many of those cases were not publicized individually.",
      "One that was: Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained by immigration authorities in Massachusetts for authoring an opinion piece criticizing Tufts University for not taking a tougher line on alleged Israeli atrocities in Gaza.",
      "U.S. officials said at the time that her visa had been revoked because of adverse foreign policy consequences if she remained in the United States.",
      "Other high-profile and public cases of visa revocations for political reasons date back decades, including actor Charlie Chaplin in 1952 during the Truman administration and an ultimately unsuccessful deportation attempt against Beatles singer John Lennon in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe practice of ideological exclusion has a long history in the United States, having been used for decades as a political tool to keep U.S. audiences from being exposed to dissident viewpoints,\u201d the human rights group Amnesty International said in a 2020 report.",
      "\u201cDuring the Cold War, in particular, the U.S. government denied visas to some of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, writers and artists who, the government thought, might promote Communism or other 'subversive' views,\u201d it said.",

      "While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his high-stakes federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel",
      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "Monday was the last day as an independent agency for the six-decade-old humanitarian and development organization, created by President John F. Kennedy as a peaceful way of promoting U.S. national security by boosting goodwill and prosperity abroad.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered USAID absorbed into the State Department on Tuesday.",
      "The former presidents and Bono spoke with thousands in the USAID community in a videoconference, which was billed as a closed-press event to allow political leaders and others privacy for sometimes angry and often teary remarks. Parts of the video were shared with The Associated Press.",
      "They expressed their appreciation for the thousands of USAID staffers who have lost their jobs and life's work. Their agency was one of the first and most fiercely targeted for government-cutting by President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, with staffers abruptly locked out of systems and offices and terminated by mass emailing.",
      "Trump claimed the agency was run by \u201cradical left lunatics\u201d and rife with \u201ctremendous fraud.\u201d Musk called it \u201ca criminal organization.\u201d",
      "Obama, speaking in a recorded statement, offered assurances to the aid and development workers, some listening from overseas.",
      "\"Your work has mattered and will matter for generations to come,\u201d he told them.",
      "Obama has largely kept a low public profile during Trump\u2019s second term and refrained from criticizing the monumental changes that Trump has made to U.S. programs and priorities at home and abroad.",
      "\u201cGutting USAID is a travesty, and it\u2019s a tragedy. Because it\u2019s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world,\u201d Obama said. He credited USAID with not only saving lives, but being a main factor in global economic growth that has turned some aid-receiving countries into U.S. markets and trade partners.",
      "The former Democratic president predicted that \u201dsooner or later, leaders on both sides of the aisle will realize how much you are needed.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the State Department said it would be introducing the department\u2019s foreign assistance successor to USAID, to be called America First, this week.",
      "\u201cThe new process will ensure there is proper oversight and that every tax dollar spent will help advance our national interests,\u201d the department said.",
      "USAID oversaw programs around the world, providing water and life-saving food to millions uprooted by conflict in Sudan, Syria, Gaza and elsewhere, sponsoring the \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d that revolutionized modern agriculture and curbed starvation and famine, preventing disease outbreaks, promoting democracy, and providing financing and development that allowed countries and people to climb out of poverty.",
      "Bush, who also spoke in a recorded message, went straight to the cuts in a landmark AIDS and HIV program started by his Republican administration and credited with saving 25 million lives around the world.",
      "Bipartisan blowback from Congress to cutting the popular President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, helped save significant funding for the program. But cuts and rule changes have reduced the number getting the life-saving care.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve showed the great strength of America through your work \u2014 and that is your good heart,\u2019\u2019 Bush told USAID staffers. \u201cIs it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you,\" he said.",
      "Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, former Colombian President Juan Manual Santos and former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield also spoke to the staffers.",
      "So did humanitarian workers, including one who spoke of the welcome appearance of USAID staffers with food when she was a frightened 8-year-old child in a camp for Liberian refugees. A World Food Program official vowed through sobs that the U.S. aid mission would be back someday.",
      "Bono, a longtime humanitarian advocate in Africa and elsewhere, was announced as the \u201csurprise guest,\u201d in shades and a cap.",
      "He jokingly hailed the USAID staffers as \u201csecret agents of international development\u201d in acknowledgment of the down-low nature of Monday\u2019s unofficial gathering of the USAID community.",
      "Bono spoke passionately as he recited a poem he had written to the agency and its gutting. He spoke of children dying of malnutrition, in a reference to people \u2014 millions, experts have said \u2014 who will die because of the U.S cuts to funding for health and other programs abroad.",
      "\u201cThey called you crooks. When you were the best of us,\u201d Bono said.",

      "Oliver devoted a May 4 segment to names and promotions of minor league baseball teams, announcing: \u201cWe are willing to use all of our resources and stupidity to give one Minor League Baseball team a total rebrand.

      "Oliver announced Sunday he had chosen Moon Mammoths, using Bob Costas' voice as narrator of a promotional video introducing the moniker.",
      "The name was inspired by the 1991 discovery of woolly mammoth remains by George Moon, a Summit Township resident who found a bone while scuba diving in Lake Pleasant, about 8 miles south of Erie. The mammoth remains are housed in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Erie, which has won the past two Eastern League championships, will be renamed the Moon Mammoths for games on July 19, Aug. 19, Sept. 12 and Sept. 13.",
      "Major League Baseball said Monday the team will wear jerseys with a rising moon with the team\u2019s name across the chest, a moon on sleeves and a patch with a woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "Oliver is expected to attend the July 19 game against Chesapeake, called a \u201cMammoth Fun\u201d night. The first 1,000 ticketed fans will receive a Moon Mammoths squishy toy and there will be postgame fireworks. George Moon was also invited to attend.",

      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",
      "A spokesman for the administration said Prasad \u201chas raised serious concerns\u201d about the issue.",
      "\u201cWe will not ignore these risks and will ensure that the gold standard of science is used for any decisions,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, in an emailed statement.",
      "Outside researchers have noted that cases of the heart condition tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May.",
      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.",
      "The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency's authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.",
      "\u201cThe intended effect \u2026 was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,\u201d the lawsuit argued.",

      "But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.",

      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",

      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",

      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",

      "PARIS -- About 40% of flights were canceled Friday at all Paris airports and tens of thousands of passengers were rearranging plans at the height of the summer travel season because of a strike by French air traffic controllers seeking better working conditions.",
      "Disruptions started hitting airports around France on Thursday and intensified Friday. The national civil aviation authority asked airlines to cancel 40% of flights Friday at Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Beauvais airports serving Paris, half of flights in Nice and 30% of flights in Marseille, Lyon and some other cities.",
      "Despite the preventive cancelations, the authority warned in a statement that \u2033disruptions and long delays are to be expected at all French airports.\u201d",
      "Ryanair was among airlines that announced widespread disruptions, saying in a statement it canceled more than 400 flights affecting 70,000 passengers. The company said the strike affects all its flights over French airspace, as well as traffic in and out of French airports, and urged the European Union to reform air traffic rules.",
      "One of the two unions leading the strike, UNSA-ICNA, said in a statement there are not enough employees to handle surging air travel and that inflation is eating away at salaries. The unions also are protesting new reform measures aiming to more tightly monitor their work, prompted by a near-collision at the Bordeaux airport.",
      "Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot called the union demands \u2014 and their decision to strike just as French schools close for the summer and many families head on vacation \u2014 \u2033unacceptable.\u2033",

      "Pakistan's top brewery has healthy financials despite an alcohol ban for Muslims in the Islamic country",
      "RAWALPINDI, Pakistan -- A pungent fug of malt and yeastiness hangs over Murree Brewery, Pakistan \u2019s biggest and oldest producer of alcoholic drinks.",
      "The company is an outlier in a country where alcohol is outlawed for everyone except non-Muslims, who make up some 9 million people out of 241 million. Pakistan, an Islamic republic, banned booze for Muslims in the 1970s.",
      "Murree Brewery has strong financials despite the prohibition, thanks to its history, scant competition and a small, thirsty and predominantly elite consumer base.",
      "But the government exerts significant control over the sale and marketing of alcoholic beverages through red tape and high taxes, pushing brewery chairman Isphanyar Bandhara to expand the company's footprint in Pakistan's non-alcoholic drinks industry, which, although bigger, is more crowded and less lucrative.",
      "\u201cEven I tell my staff of about 2,200 that we cannot sit on our laurels by selling alcohol,\u201d said Bandhara, the third generation of his family to run the 165-year-old business that was founded by the British. \u201cIt\u2019s a restricted market, so we have to rely and focus more on the non-alcoholic side. That\u2019s where I think I would like to flex my muscles and take credit, rather than being a liquor baron.\u201d",
      "The brewery already manufactures energy drinks, juices and malted beverages, but they are not as well known as products from big international brands. However, this part of the business is registering double-digit growth, and Bandhara wants to cash in on the country's youth bulge. Around 64% of the population is under 30.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s government determines the brewery\u2019s alcohol prices, points of sale and customer base. Last year it took $35 million from the brewery's revenue in taxes. The company cannot advertise its alcoholic beverages or expand that part of the business inside Pakistan. Online shopping is unavailable.",
      "The brewery is permitted to export beer to countries outside the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a 57-member bloc, even though there is a \u201cbig demand for liquor and beer\u201d in Muslim-majority countries, Bandhara said.",
      "Meanwhile, more Pakistanis drink far more sodas and juices, with billions of dollars in sales every year. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola dominate, but there are also homegrown brands.",
      "\u201cThe multinationals are thriving in Pakistan,\u201d Bandhara said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rewarding market. There might be less money (in non-alcoholic drinks), but it\u2019s more secure.\u201d",
      "Murree Brewery's malted drinks line is packaged in a way that strongly resembles its beery counterparts. The taste, while not unpleasant, is distinctive, sweet and slightly yeasty.",
      "Alcohol is a niche item in Pakistan. Even cooking ingredients like red wine vinegar, and buying essentials like cough medicine, is hard because of their alcohol content, however minuscule.",
      "Five-star hotels slip a drinks list into the in-room dining menu or decant alcohol into a more discreet vessel, like a teapot. Some restaurants, usually upscale, allow diners to bring a bottle but seat them away from others or shield the pour from prying eyes. There is often a windowless, joyless bar in major Pakistani cities.",
      "Non-Muslims \u2014 nationals and foreigners \u2014 can get a liquor permit allowing them to buy limited amounts of alcohol. Diplomats and the elite are a rich source of booze, with well-stocked cabinets and sometimes entire rooms dedicated to drinks.",
      "There are also wine shops, but only in some provinces and run by non-Muslims. Some wine shops deliver to customers waiting in their cars, for discretion. Home delivery is also available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not expensive to buy beer,\u201d said Faisal, a Pakistani Muslim drinker who is in his 30s and lives in the province of Sindh. He only gave his first name because he is breaking the law. \u201cA local beer will cost 500 rupees ($1.76), but you can save 50 rupees if you don\u2019t want it chilled.\"",
      "He added: \u201cBeer is cheaper than coffee in Pakistan, but you only need one coffee whereas you need a lot of beer.\"",
      "Non-sanctioned alcohol drinking in Pakistan is punishable by 80 lashes of a whip, although the Federal Shariat Court deemed the penalty un-Islamic in a 2009 ruling.",
      "Alcohol is considered haram, or forbidden, in Islam. Although a sin and not a crime, scholars and religious authorities typically point to a verse in the Quran that calls intoxicants \u201cthe work of Satan\u201d and tells believers to avoid them. They also cite sayings of the Prophet Muhammad and the effects of alcohol.",
      "Nonetheless, stacked on pallets at Murree Brewery on a recent day were boxes of booze. The beer was heading to government-authorized retailer Pearl Continental Hotel in the eastern city of Lahore. The whiskey was going to Sindh, home to religious minorities including Hindus and Parsis.",
      "Bandhara, who is Parsi, is one of the brewery\u2019s leading tasters. Only non-Muslims can sample the company\u2019s alcoholic products.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just force someone to drink an inferior drink, so it has to be quality,\u201d Bandhara said. \u201cIf the German Embassy, the Chinese Embassy and a lot of European embassies are my customers for beer, I\u2019m comfortable on my quality.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of Pakistani distilleries produce the intoxicating agent ethanol, which is mostly exported. Home brewers are another source of alcoholic beverages. But homemade liquor containing poisonous methanol has proved fatal, and dozens of people have died over the years.",
      "Murree Brewery\u2019s closest competition for alcohol is the Chinese-run Hui Coastal Brewery and Distillery Limited, which began making beer in southwestern Balochistan in 2021, largely for the thousands of Chinese workers there.",
      "Nobody from Hui was available to comment.",
      "The granting of a licence to Hui in conservative Balochistan took Bandhara aback. He said he was unafraid of competition but wanted a level playing field.",
      "Decades ago, his family wanted to set up a brewery in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province. Bandhara said authorities told the family to keep their heads down because they were in a Muslim country.",
      "\u201cIf the Islamic lecture is for me, why was the license given to the Chinese brewery?\" he asked. \"We are a liquor company, and we are the easiest to throw stones at and to criticize.\u201d",

      "Three helicopters and a thermal drone were deployed to conduct an aerial search over the waters of the Bali Strait, while about 20 vessels were mobilized for the sea search, Suyatno said. As weather forecasts predict high waves and rough waters around the Bali Strait on Friday, he said at least three navy ships to being deployed to replace small boats.",

      "The South\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military identified and tracked the individual near the central-west section of the military demarcation line and conducted a \u201cguiding operation\u201d before taking the person into custody Thursday night.",
      "It said authorities plan to investigate the border crossing and did not immediately say whether they view the incident as a defection attempt.",
      "The Joint Chiefs said it notified the U.S.-led United Nations Command about the incident and had not detected any immediate signs of unusual military activity by the North.",
      "According to the Joint Chiefs, a South Korean military team approached the unarmed North Korean man after detecting him and, after identifying themselves as South Korean troops, guided him safely out of the mine-strewn Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas.",
      "Border tensions have flared in recent months as the two Koreas traded Cold War-style psychological warfare, with North Korea sending thousands of trash-filled balloons toward the South and South Korea blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda through loudspeakers.",
      "Since taking office last month, South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung has made efforts to rebuild trust with North Korea, halting the frontline loudspeaker broadcasts and moving to ban activists from flying balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border.",

      "In June last year, North Korean troops crossed the border three times, prompting South Korea to fire warning shots. Experts suggested these crossings may have been accidental, occurring as North Korean troops added anti-tank barriers, planted mines and carried out other work to bolster border defenses amid escalating tensions between the Koreas.",
      "Diplomacy between the war-divided Koreas has derailed since the collapse of denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang in 2019, which prompted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to accelerate the expansion of his military nuclear program and threaten nuclear conflict toward Washington and Seoul.

      "An anti-military resistance organization says that it shot down a Myanmar military fighter jet in a combat zone in the country\u2019s east",
      "BANGKOK -- A Myanmar military fighter jet crashed in a combat zone in the country\u2019s east, according to an anti-military resistance organization that claimed to have shot it down. State-run media reported about the disappearance of an aircraft.",
      "Maui, the vice commander-in-chief and Secretary No. 2 of the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force, or KNDF, told The Associated Press on Thursday that a jet had been shot down early Wednesday by the resistance fighters during heavy fighting near Hpasawng township in Kayah state, which is also known as Karenni.",
      "Hpasawng is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of the capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "Claims of aircraft being shot down are difficult to independently confirm, because of tight restrictions on the media and the remoteness of where much combat takes place.",
      "Maui said that the wreckage of the plane, along with the remains of the two pilots nearby, were found on Thursday morning, after a search was conducted. He also posted photos and video of the jet\u2019s smoking wreckage on a hill with the resistance fighters, including him, posing in the background. Local media also posted images of a crashed plane with what appeared to be human remains nearby.",
      "The claims that an aircraft had been shot down came a few hours after the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper on Thursday reported that the military fighter jet had suddenly disappeared from radar and lost communications during long-distance training maneuvers on Tuesday night, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Naypyitaw.",
      "The report said that it was possibly caused by a technical fault or bad weather, and a search and recovery effort was underway, without identifying the type of jet or mentioning casualties.",
      "The KNDF identified the plane as a two-seater Chinese FTC-2000G, a ground-attack jet. In a statement released on its Facebook page on Thursday, the resistance group said that the military has been launching heavy attacks with various fighter jets after the combined resistance forces seized an army infantry battalion in Hpasawng on Monday.",
      "Maui said that the plane could be the same one that the military had declared missing.",
      "Kayah, which is the smallest of Myanmar\u2019s seven states and dominated by the Karenni ethnic minority, has experienced intense conflict, especially since the army seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The area borders Thailand and isn't far from Myanmar's capital.",
      "The crisis has led to the growth of armed resistance and embroiled the country in a civil war. The military, which has launched offensives in various parts of the country, makes heavy use of air power, which can't be effectively challenged by the resistance.",
      "Most combat aircraft in Myanmar\u2019s military come from China or Russia, which also supply other armaments. Many Western nations maintain an arms embargo, in addition to other sanctions on the ruling military, and are making efforts to block the supply of aviation fuel.",
      "The military is believed to have lost at least five helicopters and four fighter jets, including two aircraft that crashed in May and June, which opposition groups claimed were shot down by them.",

      "The weekly session in which the British prime minister is questioned by lawmakers in Parliament can be an ordeal for the government leader",
      "LONDON -- The weekly session in which the British prime minister is questioned by lawmakers in Parliament can be an ordeal for the government leader. For Cabinet members, it\u2019s usually simply a matter of backing their boss.",
      "But on Wednesday the spotlight ended up on Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves during the Prime Minister's Questions session because it became evident that she was crying as she sat beside Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "It's not known what triggered the tears, later said to have been personal. They came as Starmer sought to fend off attacks that his year-old government was losing its authority and that he was about to fire Reeves to regain the initiative.",
      "Traders got spooked, with the interest rate charged on the U.K.\u2019s 10-year benchmark bond in the markets up sharply, and the pound down. The moves were a sign investors had lost confidence in U.K. financial assets.",
      "Reeves had become associated with fiscal discipline, in particular a rule of covering day-to-day government spending with tax revenue, said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "\u201cThe markets are concerned that if the Chancellor goes, such fiscal discipline would follow her out of the door,\" he added.",
      "With Starmer insisting Thursday that Reeves would remain in post, the markets calmed down.",
      "Prime Minister's Questions, or PMQs, can come as close to a gladiatorial contest as is possible in a modern legislative chamber. Very little deference is given to the man or woman holding the highest office in the land.",
      "The prime minister is considered the first among equals. Like all other members of Parliament, the prime minister represents one of 650 constituencies. And nowhere is that shared connection more noticeable than at noon every Wednesday in the House of Commons.",
      "Starmer stands for half an hour every week to be quizzed by friends and foes. He may get soft balls, but there's always a potential zinger around the corner.",
      "The leader of the biggest opposition party, currently the Conservative Party's Kemi Badenoch, has the best chance to knock the prime minister off course. With six questions, she can lay traps and go for the jugular.",
      "Typically it's more theater than substance, and the weekly shouting match is consistently the most-watched parliamentary event, viewed around the world, including on C-Span in the United States.",
      "This week's session appeared to have more at stake than usual following a chaotic run-up to a welfare reform bill. With scores of Labour lawmakers opposed, Starmer was forced to scrap key planks of the bill \u2014 at a cost, politically and economically.",
      "For a prime minister, with one of the biggest majorities in history, it was a sign of weakness.",
      "Many Labour MPs blame Reeves, for her rigid adherence to her budget rules.",
      "As usual, Starmer was flanked to his left by Reeves, who didn't look her usual self, clearly bloated around the eyes.",
      "Badenoch showed little mercy, describing Reeves as \u201cabsolutely miserable\u201d and a \u201chuman shield\u201d for Starmer. She asked Starmer whether he could repeat a pledge that Reeves would stay in her post until the general election, which has to take place by the middle of 2029.",
      "While praising Reeves' handling of the economy, Starmer didn't give that assurance, and it was around this point that Reeves wiped away a tear.",
      "\u201cHow awful for the Chancellor that he couldn\u2019t confirm that she would stay in place,\" Badenoch responded.",
      "Starmer's Downing Street operation faced questions over Reeves' teary appearance. Could it have been hay fever? Had Starmer told Reeves she would be fired for the government's recent woes, which has seen Labour's approval ratings slide?",
      "Starmer's press spokesman said it was a \u201cpersonal matter,\u201d insisted Reeves was \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d and had the prime minister's \u201cfull backing.\u201d",
      "Later, Starmer told the BBC that Reeves would be Chancellor for a \u201cvery long time\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d to suggest her distress was related to the welfare U-turn.",
      "Images of Reeves' agitated state were emblazoned across newspapers and remained a key item on the news agenda.",
      "Starmer repeated on Thursday that Reeves would remain Chancellor \u201cfor years to come\" and sought to explain why he hadn't comforted Reeves during PMQs.",
      "\u201cIn PMQs, it is bang, bang, bang,\" he said at an event where he and Reeves hugged. \"That\u2019s what it was yesterday and therefore I was probably the last to appreciate anything going on in the chamber.\u201d",
      "Reeves appeared more like her usual self.",
      "\u201cPeople saw I was upset, but that was yesterday,\" she told Sky News. \u201cI guess the thing that is different from my job and many of your viewers is that when I\u2019m having a tough day, it\u2019s on the telly.\u201d",

      "Denmark\u2019s priority will be to set Europe on track to properly defend itself by 2030. That will require laying the groundwork for countries to buy the military equipment needed to execute NATO\u2019s defense plans with Trump's security priorities lying outside Europe.",
      "That will mean wrapping up negotiations on proposals that will help countries purchase and make military equipment together.",
      "Helping Ukraine, but also Moldova, to join the EU soon is another security priority. Moldova has been shaken by Russian meddling in the form of energy coercion, election interference and disinformation campaigns.",

      "With fresh elections in Moldova in September, pressure is mounting for the EU to \u201cdecouple\u201d their accession tracks. Bjerre said \u201call political and practical means\u201d will be used first to persuade Hungary \u2014 a small EU country and the only one standing in Ukraine's way \u2014 to lift its veto.",
      "She said it\u2019s important to send clear signals to Balkans countries. Most have waited many years to join.",
      "As Trump wages tariff war, trade has changed drastically. The EU has sought new trade agreements with other countries, such as India, while other trade pacts are being revamped. Denmark says it's important to accelerate that process.",
      "The government in Copenhagen says it's also seeking to cut more bureaucratic red tape in order to speed up innovation.",
      "A major challenge looms in the form of the EU\u2019s next long-term budget. Von der Leyen plans to unveil the commission's blueprint for the seven-year spending package, which should enter force in 2028, on July 16.",
      "With defense spending increases weighing heavily on national purses, member countries are unlikely to want to stump up more funds for European priorities. Denmark\u2019s aim is to get the debate \u2014 which could run for two years \u2014 off on the right track.",
      "Despite some backsliding, the EU still holds to its goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, by cutting greenhouse gases and compensating for any remaining emissions. Denmark will lead work on setting a 2040 target to guide climate action and investment to keep the bloc on track.",
      "Part of that will be the transition away from fossil fuels to green energy forms. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has highlighted the dangers of energy dependence on any one supplier.",
      "Sanctions and political pressure have not stopped some EU countries of getting their oil and gas from Russia, although the level of dependency has dropped markedly since 2022. Denmark says the continued phase out remains a priority.",

Denmark says it's important to persuade people not to set out for Europe in the first place.",
      "Work will also continue on preparing the vast asylum and migration policy pact to come into force next year. The pact was seen as the answer to Europe\u2019s migration woes, but countries still differ on how best to tackle the challenge.",

      "The ship is China\u2019s second aircraft carrier and first to have been fully self-built. It is smaller than U.S. carriers, carrying 24 Shenyang J-10 fighters and weighing in at 70,000 tons fully loaded.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- From suspended tables to underwater lounges, some 13,000 food and drink establishments in Dubai pull out all the stops to attract customers in one of the world\u2019s most saturated dining markets.",
      "They cater to all tastes and budgets. Some spots ladle out inexpensive biryani while others offer dishes dusted with edible gold.",
      "These are some of the ways the emirate is competing with its neighbors Saudi Arabia and Qatar for tourist dollars and, so far, it\u2019s beating them handily. Dubai has more restaurants per capita than any major city except Paris.",
      "But the city-state\u2019s booming restaurant scene is testing the limits of its growth-at-all-costs model, raising questions about how long Dubai can keep feeding its own ambitions.",
      "The competition is cutthroat, so presentation is key.",
      "\u201cGone are the days when it just tastes good,\u201d said Kym Barter, the general manager of Atlantis The Palm, a resort perched on a manmade archipelago that boasts more Michelin stars than any other venue in the Middle East.",
      "But dazzling Dubai\u2019s food bloggers \u2014 the most popular of whom have millions of social media followers \u2014 isn\u2019t enough. Staying afloat means battling high rents and winning over a diverse and demanding group of consumers.",
      "Dubai has roughly nine expatriate residents for every Emirati citizen. Most of its private sector workers are migrants on temporary contracts, and only Vatican City has a higher share of foreign-born residents.",
      "Tourists, in turn, outnumber locals about five to one by some estimates, and they spend lavishly. Visitors to Dubai drop an average of over five times more than those traveling to nearby Saudi Arabia or even the U.S., according to global restaurant consultant Aaron Allen.",
      "Dubai is \u201con the right path\u201d to becoming the world's food capital, said Torsten Vildgaard, executive chef at FZN by Bj\u00f6rn Frantz\u00e9n. The restaurant, which runs at more than $540 a head, was one of two in Dubai to nab three Michelin stars in May.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only seeing the tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s to come in terms of gastronomy here,\u201d Vildgaard added.",
      "With each new set of illuminated high-rises and hotels, another crop of eateries emerge, vying for patrons. The legions of construction workers powering Dubai\u2019s progress also need affordable options.",
      "That growth, propped up in part by investor pressure on some of the world\u2019s biggest chains to expand in Dubai, has created what some analysts warn is a bubble.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a publicly traded company like Americana, what are you supposed to do \u2014 just stop opening restaurants?\u201d restaurant consultant Allen said, referring to the Gulf-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and other big franchises.",
      "The frenetic expansion of Dubai\u2019s restaurant industry is part of a regional shift that has seen Gulf Arab states pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building out tourist destinations as they move away from hydrocarbons to diversify their economies. Saudi Arabia has a high-stakes, $500 billion project: a straight-line futuristic city called Neom.",
      "But, in a Muslim-majority region, the United Arab Emirates has gone to lengths that some consider too much of a compromise, including relaxing restrictions on alcohol that fuel its pubs and nightlife and other social reforms.",
      "The rapid development comes at a price. Dubai\u2019s restaurants have a high failure rate, industry veterans say, though local authorities don't say what the rate of closures is. In the downtown district and other prime areas, annual rents for restaurants can top $100 per square foot. That\u2019s on a par with some of the world\u2019s most expensive cities.",
      "Still, the emirate issued almost 1,200 new restaurant licenses last year, according to Dubai\u2019s Department of Economy and Tourism. The department declined to respond to questions.",
      "Empty tables during peak hours are common, even in top locations. Part of the problem, managers say, is that traffic congestion is so severe that convincing diners to drive out can be a tall task.",
      "\u201cI sometimes go, \u2018Do I go into the restaurant right now, because I\u2019m going to get into traffic?\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Waseem Abdul Hameed, operations manager at Ravi, a Pakistani family-owned eatery famous for its official Adidas shoe line and a 2010 TV feature from Anthony Bourdain.",
      "He knows restaurateurs who have had to shut up shop and others who are squeezed by slim margins and increasingly reliant on delivery apps, Hameed said.",
      "The demand sends fleets of migrant workers racing through gridlock on motorbikes, with few protections and tight delivery windows. Emirati newspaper Khaleej Times reported the accidental deaths of 17 Dubai food couriers last year.",
      "The math of Dubai\u2019s restaurant scene doesn't add up, delivery apps and wealthy tourists notwithstanding, restaurant consultant Allen said. He cited operating expenses that have more than doubled relative to sales since 2009, when a financial crisis almost hobbled the emirate.",
      "Too many Dubai entrepreneurs, he put it simply, have \u201ctoo much money, and they don\u2019t know what to do besides open restaurants.\u201d",

      "For decades, the 14th Dalai Lama has been more than a spiritual leader. He has sustained a nation in exile and managed to build a community that\u2019s kept the Tibetan culture and identity alive. He is the China -reviled spokesperson for a Tibetan homeland that many, like him, can see only from afar. He has received a Nobel Peace Prize and been courted by royalty, politicians and Hollywood stars, helping him draw global attention and support for Tibet.",
      "When his death comes, it will pitch the global Tibetan community into uncertainty, perhaps for years. His successor will have to be found through the traditional process of reincarnation. China, whose troops took control of Tibet in 1950, says it will reject anyone chosen without Beijing's consent.",
      "Tibetans in India\u2019s Himalayan town of Dharamshala, the Dalai Lama\u2019s home in exile, and scattered around the world fear a new onslaught on their cultural and religious identity.",
      "\u201cThe absence of His Holiness would be a huge setback for the Tibetans,\u201d said Penpa Tsering, the head of the democratically elected Tibetan government-in-exile. \u201cThe responsibility lies on us as to how we carry forward the legacy of His Holiness.\u201d",
      "The Dalai Lama has become one of the world\u2019s most recognizable figures while leading a Tibetan diaspora through their struggle for autonomy and opposition of China\u2019s control of Tibet. He has not named a successor, but he says they will be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d \u2014 outside China.",
      "Previous Dalai Lamas have been identified by senior monastic disciples, under strict religious rituals meant to identify their predecessor's reincarnation. Monks interpret signs, consult oracles and send search committees to Tibetan households looking for a child who exhibits the qualities of the Dalai Lama.",
      "All of this takes years of effort, leaving a leadership vacuum. Years of religious education and training are needed before the identified successor grows up and takes up full responsibilities as spiritual leader.",
      "China has already sought to elevate other spiritual figures, particularly Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s No. 2 figure, the Panchen Lama, whose legitimacy is highly contested by many Tibetans at home and in exile.",
      "Gyaltsen Norbu was installed by Beijing as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 after followers of the Dalai Lama recognized a different boy as the Panchen\u2019s incarnation. That boy disappeared soon after.",

      "Like many other Tibetans, however, his hopes are pinned on the government in exile. \u201cHow is home not anything but a genuine human demand?\u201d he added.",
      "Such concerns are most prevalent in Dharamshala, where a Tibetan community of over 20,000 administers its own schools, hospitals and monasteries and elects its own lawmakers and president. The Dalai Lama handed over his political powers to a democratically elected government in 2011.",
      "China doesn\u2019t recognize the Tibetan government-in-exile and brands the Dalai Lama a dangerous separatist. It has shunned direct contact with his representatives for more than a decade.",
      "It has insisted that the Dalai Lama\u2019s successor will be from inside China and must be approved by its government.",
      "Tibetans in exile have long been wary of the officially atheist Chinese government\u2019s attempts to meddle with the Tibetan Buddhism reincarnation system. They see it as part of Beijing\u2019s plan to tighten its control over Tibet.",
      "\u201cIf they do it, they are actually making a mockery of themselves among the free countries,\u201d said Geshe Lhakdor, a Tibetan Buddhist scholar, calling Beijing\u2019s stance \u201chypocrisy.\u201d",
      "Tibetans say they were effectively independent for centuries and accuse China of trying to wipe out Tibet\u2019s Buddhist culture and language. Many of the more than 7 million Tibetans living under Chinese rule accuse Beijing of stifling religious freedoms, changing its ethnic makeup by moving millions of Han Chinese into the region and torturing political prisoners.",
      "The Chinese government denies these allegations.",
      "For years, governments across the world have feted the Dalai Lama for advocating for Tibetan rights and spreading a message of nonviolence. They have also helped him raise tens of millions of dollars to build Tibetan cultural and religious institutions.",

      "\u201cEverybody has benefited at our cost because they have been trading with China,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cWe are, in a way, a victim of geopolitics.\u201d",

We are now doing our best,\u201d Lee said. \u201dWhat we need is a truly reciprocal outcome that benefits both sides and works for everyone, but so far, both sides are still trying to define exactly what they want.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s 90-day pause in global reciprocal tariffs is set to expire on July 9, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates.",
      "Washington has separately been seeking higher duties on specific products such as automobiles and semiconductors, which are key exports for South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy. There are growing concerns in Seoul that Trump may also demand a broader deal requiring South Korea to pay significantly more for the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country to deter North Korean threats.",
      "Lee has consistently urged patience on tariffs, arguing that rushing to secure an early deal would not serve the national interest. His trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, was reportedly arranging a visit to Washington for possible meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "On North Korea, Lee said he would seek to restore long-dormant talks with Pyongyang, whose expanding military cooperation with Russia pose major security concerns to their neighbors.",
      "\u201cI think we should improve relations with North Korea based on a reliable coordination and consultation between South Korea and the U.S.,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut I expect that won\u2019t be easy as mutual antagonism and distrust are too serious.\u201d",
      "Lee previously faced criticism that he was tilting toward North Korea and China and away from the U.S. and Japan. But during his campaign, Lee promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy, saying he would bolster the alliance with the U.S. while also seeking to repair ties with North Korea, China and Russia. Some critics say it\u2019s too difficult to satisfy all parties.",
      "Lee added that he had proposed resuming more frequent summits with Japan.",
      "Lee's government has made proactive efforts to build trust with North Korea, halting frontline anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts and taking steps to ban activists from flying balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border.",
      "Trump has also expressed intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Lee has said he would support Trump\u2019s push.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t publicly responded to the conciliatory gestures by Trump and Lee. But officials said North Korean propaganda broadcasts are no longer being heard in South Korean border towns.",
      "North Korea has refused talks with the U.S. and South Korea since earlier Trump-Kim nuclear talks collapsed in 2019. North Korea is now working to expand relations with Russia, supplying troops and weapons to support its war against Ukraine in return for economic and military assistance.",

      "NEW YORK -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for potential buyers who have wrestled with rising home prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.67% from 6.77% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell to 5.80% from 5.89% last week. A year ago, it was 6.25%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "High borrowing costs are also putting pressure on the new home market. Last week, the government reported that sales of new U.S. homes fell nearly 14% in May from the previous month.",
      "Recent data suggests sales could pick up in the coming months, especially with the recent decline in mortgage rates. A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales rose 1.8% in May from the previous month and increased 1.1% from May last year, the National Association of Realtors said last week.",
      "There\u2019s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.33% at midday Thursday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "Mortgage rates have now fallen five weeks in a row, reflecting the recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates appears to have encouraged some home shoppers. Last week, mortgage applications rose 2.7% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "NEW YORK -- Nissan is recalling more than 480,000 of its vehicles across the U.S. and Canada due to potential manufacturing defects that could cause engine failure.",
      "The recall covers certain Nissan Rogues between 2021-2024 model years and 2019-2020 Altimas \u2014 as well as a number of 2019-2022 Infiniti QX50s and 2022 Infiniti QX55s sold under the automaker's luxury brand, according to Nissan and documents published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week.",
      "The vehicles impacted carry specific \u201cVC-Turbo\u201d engines that may have manufacturing defects in their bearings, the NHTSA's recall report notes. This may cause engine damage and possibly lead to engine failure while driving, the regulator warns \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Engine bearing failures \u201care not typically instantaneous and tend to progress over time,\u201d the NHTSA\u2019s recall report notes. That means effected drivers may see multiple warning signs to look out for \u2014 including abnormal noises or malfunction indicator lights.",
      "In the U.S., 443,899 vehicles are covered in this recall, per NHTSA documents. And in Canada, 37,837 are affected, a Nissan spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "As a remedy, the NHSTA's recall report notes, Nissan and Infiniti dealers will inspect the engine pan of these-now recalled cars \u2014 and repair or replace the engine if necessary. The recall covers vehicles with either 3-cylinder 1.5L or 4-cylinder 2.0L VC-Turbo engines. Potential repairs \u2014 which will be performed free of charge \u2014 will depend on the engine and whether or not debris is detected during the inspection.",

      "Ukrainian authorities are enlisting European help to increase domestic military production as the United States pauses some weapons shipments to Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The decision by the United States to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine has come at a tough time for Kyiv: Russia\u2019s bigger army is making a concerted push on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and is intensifying long-range drone and missile attacks that increasingly hammer civilians in Ukrainian cities.",
      "Washington has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022. But the Trump administration has been disengaging from the war, and no end to the fighting is in sight, despite recent direct peace talks.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Ukraine\u2019s options following the U.S. pause of some arms deliveries:",
      "Amid recurring concerns in Kyiv about how much military support its allies can supply and how quickly, Ukraine has raced to build up its domestic defense industry.",
      "The country's output has gradually grown, especially in the production of more and increasingly sophisticated drones, but Ukraine needs to speedily scale up production.",
      "Crucially, some high-tech U.S. weapons are irreplaceable. They include Patriot air defense missiles, which are needed to fend off Russia\u2019s frequent ballistic missile attacks, but which cost $4 million each. That vital system is included in the pause, and many cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, could become increasingly vulnerable.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official said Thursday that Patriot systems are \u201ccritically necessary\u201d for Ukraine, but U.S.-made HIMARS precision-guided missiles, also paused, are in less urgent need as other countries produce similar assets.",
      "\u201cOther countries that have these (Patriot) systems can only transfer them with U.S. approval. The real question now is how far the United States is willing to go in its reluctance to support Ukraine,\u201d he told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the subject.",
      "The official said that Patriot missiles exist in sufficient numbers globally, and he said that accessing them requires political resolve.",
      "\u201cThere are enough missiles out there,\u201d he said, without providing evidence.",
      "He also stated that Ukraine has already scaled up its domestic production of 155 mm artillery shells, which were once critically short, and is now capable of producing more than is currently contracted. \u201cSupplies from abroad have also become more available than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Amid at times fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been enlisting greater European help for his country\u2019s arms manufacturing plans.",
      "European countries don\u2019t have the production levels, military stockpiles or the technology to pick up all the slack left by the U.S. pause, but Zelenskyy is recruiting their help for ambitious joint investment projects.",
      "Draft legislation to help Ukrainian defense manufacturers scale up and modernize production, including building new facilities at home and abroad, will be put to a vote in the Ukrainian parliament later this month, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced this week.",
      "Zelenskyy said last month that major investments will go to the production of drones and artillery shells.",
      "\u201cThe volume of support this year is the largest since the start of the full-scale war,\u201d he said about commitments from foreign countries.",
      "Under Trump, there have been no new announcements of U.S. military or weapons aid to Ukraine. Between March and April, the United States allocated no new help at all, according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks such support.",
      "For the first time since June 2022, four months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, European countries have surpassed the U.S. in total military aid, totaling 72 billion euros ($85 billion) compared with 65 billion euros ($77 billion) from the U.S., the institute said last month.",
      "Without Patriot missiles, as well as the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile and shorter-range Stinger missiles that are also included in the pause, Ukrainian cities likely will take a bashing as more Russian missiles pierce air defenses.",
      "On the front line, Ukrainian troops haven\u2019t recently voiced complaints about ammunition shortages, as they have in the past. They have always said that during the war, they have never had as much ammunition to as their disposal as Russian forces.",
      "The army faces a different problem: It's desperately short-handed. It's turning to drones to compensate for its manpower shortage, and analysts say the front isn't about to collapse.",
      "Asked about the timing of the U.S. pause, the Ukrainian official emphasized the need for stable, reliable supply lines.",

The widespread expectation is that they hired more people than they fired but that the pace of hiring slowed from May.",
      "A stunningly weak report released Wednesday morning raised worries that Thursday\u2019s report may fall short. The data from ADP suggested that U.S. employers outside the government cut 33,000 jobs from their payrolls last month, when economists were expecting to see growth of 115,000 jobs.",
      "The ADP report does not have a perfect track record predicting what the U.S. government\u2019s more comprehensive jobs report will say each month. That preserves hope that Thursday\u2019s data could be more encouraging, though there are fears that uncertainty around President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could cause employers to freeze their hiring.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s stiff proposed taxes on imports are currently on pause, and they\u2019re scheduled to kick into effect in about a week. Unless Trump reaches deals with other countries to lower the tariffs, they could hurt the economy and worsen inflation.",
      "Elsewhere on Thursday, the benchmark U.S. crude lost 62 cents to $66.83. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 63 cents to $68.53. The dollar was trading at 143.87 Japanese yen, up from 143.65 yen. The euro was barely changed at $1,1791 from $1.1790.",

      "Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July: getting all the gear needed to host a pool party costs less than it has in years, according to a market research company's preliminary data.",
      "The total price to buy beach towels, a beverage cooler, bathing suits and other accountrements of summer fun averaged $858 in June, the lowest amount for the month since 2020, consumer data provider Numerator said in an analysis prepared for The Associated Press.",
      "The finding from the firm's seasonal snapshot comports with broader economic measures indicating that U.S. consumers so far have not seen major impacts from President Donald Trump's vigorous application of tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. To see how prices are shaping up for the summer, the company looked at the average purchase price for 16 seasonal items typically made in China.",
      "Along with four towels, a cooler and bathing suits for two adults and a toddler, the hypothetical shopping list for a poolside gathering included a grill, four patio chairs, four cushions, a patio umbrella and four outdoor pillows. Recreation supplies included a cornhole set, two pairs of swim goggles, a set of diving rings, two beach balls and two pool floats or noodles.",
      "Leo Feler, Numerator\u2019s chief economist, offered a few theories for why buying all that stuff cost 11% less last month than it did in June 2023, when the average cost reached a high of $966, and 8.4% less than it did in June 2024.",
      "Wholesale suppliers and retailers that order from Chinese manufacturers may have imported too much stock while trying to stay ahead of high tariff bills, Feler said. As declining consumer confidence measures pointed to the possibility of weak sales, those businesses might have offered early discounts rather than risking their merchandise going unsold, he said.",
      "Given wide swings in Trump\u2019s trade posture toward China, retail vendors may have decided to absorb any initial tariff costs instead of trying to figure out how much more to charge their business customers, Feler said. The tariff rate on Chinese products soared to 145% in April before China and the U.S. reached a deal last month that brought the overall rate down to 55%.",
      "Suppliers often work on six-month contracts that are signed in January or February and again in June or July. That means many contracts for patio tables and chairs, for example, were signed before the White House included metal furniture in the aluminum or steel products that would be subject to a 25% tariff that went up to 50% last month.",
      "Customers who want to buy a new set of beach towels or to replace an old cooler still might want to hold off until August since prices will get lower in late summer, Feler said. But waiting until next year may prove costly, if the tariffs on products from China remain in place, he said.",
      "Just because preparing for a backyard bash might be comparatively less expensive right now, many economists and retail industry analysts still expect consumers to feel the weight of Trump's favorite trade negotiation tool. Shoppers are likely to see higher prices for back-to-school items starting in July and August, according to Feler.",
      "The time it's taking for the extra taxes on imports to reach stores could turn out like the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions that contributed to U.S. inflation in 2021 and 2022.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like there was a sudden surge,\" Feler said. \"It was a few prices increased here, then a few more prices, and a few other prices, and a couple more prices. And it started gaining speed.\u201d",

      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "She settled in the United States, teaching \u2014 and learning \u2014 at Princeton. She took classes in entrepreneurship and built contacts in the business world. Ferguson knew how many of her former international colleagues had to hustle to find outlets for their work, and envisioned Noosphere as a landing spot. Her business partner, Seb Walker, worked at Vice Media, known for its strong international reporting before filing for bankruptcy in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt's gotten a lot harder to continue making a living doing this,\u201d said Matthew Cassell, an international correspondent whose credits include Vice. A member of Noosphere's inaugural class of journalists, Cassell has posted videos giving his perspectives on the Israel-Iran war, along with recent reporting from the West Bank.",
      "Shrouq Al Aila contributed video from Gaza, showing efforts to distribute aid as the sound of gunfire is heard in the background. Oren Ziv reported from a missile strike in Israel, walking through a hospital's shattered hallways to show the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a really high-quality reporter is Face-Timing you from the field,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwhich is really cool.\u201d",
      "News consumers, particularly young ones, are souring on more stilted, conventional television news reporting, said veteran journalist Kate O'Brian, who is on Noosphere's board of directors. \u201cThe stage has been set for an audience who wants to hear directly from the journalist,\u201d O'Brian said.",
      "Ferguson envisions a reporting staff that is roughly half international, half based in the United States. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza reports on Washington for Noosphere.",
      "Her biggest signing to date is former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd. He started a Sunday night show in June, with \u201cWar Room\u201d host Steve Bannon and Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, as his first guests. Todd has hired the former producer for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, a clue to his ambitions for an eclectic show interviewing interesting people from politics and business.",
      "\u201cJane's hard to say no to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cLike any smart executive, she knows what she doesn't know, and goes to find smart people who she thinks know more.\"",
      "Ferguson's bet is that audiences can only afford so many Substack subscriptions to individual journalists, and that Noosphere will offer access to more at a set price. She's also talked to news outlets interested in acquiring some of the reporters' work.",
      "The challenge to getting Noosphere established is an increasingly crowded marketplace, and several of her journalists aren't household names.",
      "Noosphere journalists are paid a percentage of subscription fees, and given a greater amount if a subscriber specifically cites that contributor's work in signing on. Ferguson will not say how many subscribers she has yet.",
      "\u201cSubstack created a market that did not exist before and I give them huge kudos for that,\u201d O'Brian said. \u201cThis is just a different way of approaching it.\u201d",
      "To succeed, \u201cyou have to offer a lot,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can't just offer one or two things. Every hot spot around the world, Noosphere will have journalists on the ground. They have a reasonable chance to be very successful in their lane. The question is how big the lane can get.\u201d",
      "Todd said Noosphere's advantage is that it has been created by reporters, a distinction from the lack of journalism experience found among executives in the business, he said.",
      "Ferguson, too, has wondered whether journalism can survive the diminishment or death of news organizations. \u201cThe solution for the problems of the industry are going to come from journalists and not media executives,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- An analysis finds that a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans, a sum that could be potentially managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.",
      "The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category that includes roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand \u2014 and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president.",
      "The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump\u2019s import taxes, contradicting his claims that foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.",
      "The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to instead schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would have faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.",
      "Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: \u201cEverything\u2019s going well.\u201d",
      "The president has indicated that he will set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. India and Vietnam have signaled that they\u2019re close to a trade framework.",
      "There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report that it expects companies to pass along 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses\u2019 inflation expectations to say that companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.",
      "The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest that the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted that companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and that wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins that they might need to spread the tariffs costs to their customers.",
      "The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday interview that the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.",
      "\u201cPeople who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Bessent said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
      "The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump keeps saying that Republicans' mega tax and spending cut legislation will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits.",
      "It does not.",
      "At best, Trump's \u201cno tax on Social Security\u201d claim exaggerates the benefits to seniors if either the House or Senate-passed proposals is signed into law.",
      "Here's a look at Trump's recent statements, and what the proposals would \u2014 or would not \u2014 do.",
      "Trump repeatedly told voters during his 2024 campaign that he would eliminate taxes on Social Security. As his massive legislative package has moved through Congress, the Republican president has claimed that's what the bill would do.",
      "Trump said on a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\" that the bill includes \u201cno tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime.\u201d",
      "But instead of eliminating the tax, the Senate and House have each passed their own versions of a temporary tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and over, which applies to all income \u2014 not just Social Security.",
      "And it turns out not all Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction. Those who won't be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don\u2019t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.",
      "The Senate proposal includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65, contrasted with the House proposal, which includes a temporary deduction of $4,000.",
      "The Senate proposal approved Tuesday would eliminate Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.",
      "If passed into law, the tax deduction would last four years, from 2025 to 2029.",
      "The deductions phase out as income increases.",
      "Touting a new Council of Economic Advisers analysis, the White House said Tuesday that \u201c88% of all seniors who receive Social Security \u2014 will pay NO TAX on their Social Security benefits,\" going on to say that the Senate proposal\u2019s $6,000 senior deduction \u201cis estimated to benefit 33.9 million seniors, including seniors not claiming Social Security. The deduction yields an average increase in after-tax income of $670 per senior who benefits from it.\u201d",
      "Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation think tank, said conflating the tax deduction with a claim that there will be no tax on Social Security could end up confusing and angering a lot of seniors who will expect to not pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.",
      "\u201cWhile the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\u201d Watson said.",
      "The cost of actually eliminating the tax on Social Security would have massive impacts on the economy.",
      "University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits \u201cwould reduce revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase federal debt by 7 percent by 2054\" and speed up the projected depletion date of the Social Security Trust Fund from 2034 to 2032.",
      "Discussions over taxes on Social Security are just part of the overall bill, which is estimated in its Senate version to increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Administration officials have said the cost of the tax bill would be offset by tariff income.",
      "Recently, the CBO separately estimated that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.",

      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",
      "Tabane Ciss\u00e9, who moved from Senegal to Spain in 2023, makes phone calls about investing Spanish earnings at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s all texts, or voice notes, with one exception.",
      "His mother doesn\u2019t read or write, but when he calls \u201cit\u2019s as if I was standing next to her,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cIt brings back memories \u2014 such pleasure.\u201d",
      "He couldn\u2019t do it without the cell phone. And half a world away, that suits Marty Cooper just fine.",
      "\u201cThere are more cell phones in the world today than there are people,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cYour life can be made infinitely more efficient just by virtue of being connected with everybody else in the world. But I have to tell you that this is only the beginning.\u201d",

      "The Wonsan-Kalma eastern coastal tourist zone, which North Korea says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the heart of leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s struggling economy. But prospects for the resort, the biggest tourist complex in North Korea, aren\u2019t clear, as the country won\u2019t likely fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon, observers say.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported the Wonsan-Kalma area began service Tuesday, drawing a large number of North Koreans who enjoyed open water swimming, slides and other attractions at a water park and various water activities in the area.",
      "\u201cThe guests\u2019 hearts were filled with overwhelming emotion as they felt the astonishing new heights of our-style tourism culture blossoming under the era of the Workers\u2019 Party,\" KCNA said in a typical propaganda-driven dispatch.",
      "Photos released by North Korean state media showed children with tubes and inflatable balls dipping into the sea, while others in colorful swimsuits beamed while sitting beneath red-and-white parasols.",
      "Kim said at the inaugural ceremony last week the site would be recorded as \u201cone of the greatest successes this year\" and called its opening \u201cthe proud first step\u201d toward realizing the government\u2019s policy of developing tourism.",
      "Since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn\u2019t said whether and when it would fully resume international tourism.",
      "Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled while there are questions about ties between the two socialist neighbors. In February this year, North Korea allowed a small group of international tourists to visit its northeastern border city of Rason, only to stop that tour program in less than a month.",
      "Since February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid expanding military cooperation between the countries. But Russian government records seen by South Korean experts show a little more than 2,000 Russians, only about 880 of them tourists, visited North Korea last year, a number that is too small to revive North Korea's tourism.",
      "Russia\u2019s Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said last week that the first group of Russian tourists to the Wonsan-Kalma resort will depart on July 7 for a eight-day trip that includes a visit to Pyongyang.",

      "TVA is the nation's largest public utility and provides power to more than 10 million people across seven southern states.",
      "The White House said Trump's nominees for the federal utility are Tennesseans Lee Beaman, Mitch Graves and Jeff Hagood; and Randall Jones of Alabama.",
      "The selections follow Trump's firing of three Biden-nominated board members since late March. The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump's picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them.",
      "Without a quorum, TVA's board can take actions needed for ongoing operations but cannot jump into new areas of activity, start new programs or change the utility's existing direction.",
      "Beaman is a businessman who sold his Nashville-area fleet of car dealerships. He is also a prominent Republican political fundraiser.",

      "Less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories are just about everywhere these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Fashion \u201cdupes,\u201d or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles.",
      "In the latest example, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel.",
      "Across the retail industry, it\u2019s far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Herm\u00e8s' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There\u2019s a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas.",
      "It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday\u2019s complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful of companies have \u201creplicated or copied\u201d its apparel to sell cheaper offerings \u2014 including those popularized online through hashtags like \u201cLululemonDupes\u201d on TikTok and other social media platforms.",
      "For years, companies have rolled out a range of cheaper option for consumers to buy instead of pricey name-brands or designer labels \u2014 often through retailers' house or generic brands. Unlike more direct copies of the product with an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, \u201cpure\u201d dupes that just resemble certain features are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items.",
      "But the rising frenzy for dupes, particularly in the fashion space, signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing.",
      "Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Herm\u00e8s\u2019 coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item \u2014 sold by Kamugo, which doesn\u2019t appear to have its own website \u2014 was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a \u201cwirkin.\u201d Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart\u2019s site selling similar totes.",
      "While popular among shoppers, these kind of look-alikes can frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the \u201cwirkin,\u201d Herm\u00e8s Executive Chairman Axel Dumas shared his annoyance, for example.",
      "\u201cMaking a copy like this is quite detestable,\u201d Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was \u201cquite touching\u201d to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style \u2014 and that \u201cdifference in quality\u201d was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Herm\u00e8s.",
      "Alexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, said that \u201cthe term \u2018dupe\u2019 itself doesn\u2019t tell us much about legality,\" noting the word has also been used to describe more traditional counterfeits.",
      "But overall, dupes can move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly if a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original.",
      "\u201cWith fashion, in particular, we\u2019re going to get into some thorny questions,\" Roberts said. That includes what intellectual property rights exist and how enforceable they are, she explained, and whether there is actual infringement or if a product is just \u201cpositioning itself as a less expensive alternative.\u201d",
      "Often such disputes boil down trademark questions around consumer confusion or patented product designs. Several businesses have already put this to the test, but not always successfully.",
      "In December, for example, Benefit lost a lawsuit in California over E.l.f.'s $6 Lash \u2019N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit\u2019s $29 Roller Lash mascara. The judge\u2019s decision was \u201ca resounding win for us,\u201d E.lf. CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an E.l.f. product that\u2019s a much better value.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had \u201cunlawfully traded\u201d on Lululemon\u2019s reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement \u201cdirected to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.\u201d",
      "Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several products, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men\u2019s Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco\u2019s website showing the item priced at $19.97.",
      "Roberts said she was \u201ca little skeptical\u201d of some of Lululemon's claims, noting that the design patents in particular could be hard to challenge. And she pointed to Lululemon's asserting common law trade dress over a \u201ctriangle kind of shape in the crotch region\u201d of the ABC pants.",
      "\u201cMy first reaction as a trademark expert is that looks pretty functional,\u201d she said, and functional matter is not protected under trademark law. \u201cI was just cracking up because that particular claim seemed really far-fetched to me. Those pants look really basic.\"",
      "Still, Roberts noted that Lululemon had some plausible claims.",
      "Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't clearly reveal that information to customers. Due to this, Lululemon claims some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the \u201coriginal\u201d products.",
      "Roberts said this could rule in Lululemon's favor as something that \u201cweighs toward consumer confusion.\u201d Still, she noted that most of the products Lululemon mentioned in its complaint weren't sold under the Kirkland brand, which could undermine the argument.",
      "A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit.",
      "Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged \u201ccopycat products\u201d in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.",

      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Just playing for the U.S. national team was a big opportunity for Claire Hutton.",
      "Then Canada left her a bit too much space at the edge of the 6-yard box \u2014 and Rose Lavelle found her with a perfect corner kick. The 19-year-old midfielder was ready.",
      "Hutton headed home her first international goal, and the Americans easily dispatched Canada 3-0 in a friendly Wednesday for their fifth straight victory. Sam Coffey and Yazmeen Ryan also scored.",
      "\u201cSet pieces are something we focus on. It's what we talk about,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cAt the international level, it's what sets teams apart, especially in big tournaments. So being able to get my head on Rose's perfect ball there was just amazing. Hoping for more in the future.\u201d",
      "The Americans have won five straight friendlies by a combined score of 18-0 since their 2-1 loss to Brazil in early April. The 19-year-old Hutton was making her sixth appearance for the national team, and her goal in the 36th minute gave the U.S. a 2-0 lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. To wear this jersey, wear this badge, it weighs a lot. I know the history behind it,\" said Hutton, who plays for the Kansas City Current. \"We talked about the U.S. legacy this past week. Just knowing that I get to be a part of it, it means the world to me.\u201d",
      "U.S. coach Emma Hayes gave many of her Europe-based options a break for this stretch of three games in seven days, which also included two 4-0 wins over Ireland. That left opportunities for less experienced players like Hutton.",
      "\u201cAs I've said many times, I'm all about improving the whole ecosystem. I think more opportunities for more players with the national team will improve the NWSL,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cBecause it gives players hope and belief that if they perform, that they're going to get an opportunity.\u201d",
      "The U.S. opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Lavelle delivered a free kick into the penalty area from near the left sideline. Canada\u2019s Janine Sonis tried to head clear, but the ball fell to Avery Patterson and then bounced to Coffey about 9 yards from the goal.",
      "Both Coffey and Patterson stabbed at the ball, and both appeared to make contact with it. It went straight into the net. Coffey was credited with the goal and Patterson with an assist.",
      "\u201cI will give her full credit for that. I did not touch it at all,\u201d Patterson said, not entirely believably. \u201cI laid it up for her on a platter.\u201d",
      "Claudia Dickey, who also shut out Ireland in her international debut last Thursday, stopped a shot from in close by Canada\u2019s Jordyn Huitema shortly after Coffey\u2019s goal. But the Americans created far more chances.",
      "Canada coach Casey Stoney called her team's performance \u201cinexcusable\u201d and said her players' fitness wasn't good enough.",
      "\u201cA lack of commitment and desire, which is not this team,\u201d she said. \u201cLosing draws, losing 50-50s, not getting up to the ball, not pressing \u2014 it's not good enough. I'm not going to hide away from it.\u201d",
      "Lavelle received a standing ovation when she was subbed out around the midway point of the second half. The crowd also gave a big cheer when Tara McKeown \u2014 who plays locally for the Washington Spirit \u2014 came on as a late sub for the U.S. McKeown assisted on Ryan\u2019s goal in the 89th minute.",

      "In the time since, more and more players have spoken about the topic and seeking help, and whatever taboos there were seem to have faded. Still, the way three-time Grand Slam finalist Alexander Zverev discussed his state of mind after a first-round exit at Wimbledon this week revived the conversation.",

I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way,\u201d said Zverev, who was the runner-up at the Australian Open in January but then went through a rough stretch of results this season when he had a chance to overtake Jannik Sinner at No. 1 in the rankings.",
      "\u201cI feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice,\" Zverev said. \"It\u2019s not a feeling on a tennis court, it\u2019s just a life feeling in general.\u201d",

It honestly takes some self-reflecting, figuring out what\u2019s going wrong or how can I create a lifestyle that I enjoy. I feel like there are so many factors. For me, personally, it was finding people that I could confide in and I trusted. People that I could talk to,\" Anisimova said.",

      "Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who owns three major trophies, said that she worked with a therapist for five years.",
      "\u201cIt's really important to talk openly about whatever you\u2019re dealing with. ... It\u2019s really important to be open and to talk about what are you experiencing, because if you\u2019re going to keep it inside, it\u2019s just going to destroy you. I think that\u2019s kind of like something happening to him,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cI think (Zverev) just needs to open up to whoever is close to him.\u201d",
      "At the Australian Open, title winner Madison Keys addressed her reliance on therapy and the ways in which it both allowed her to be happier, in general, and more successful at tennis \u2014 a sport in which losses are frequent and expectations can be a burden.",
      "\u201cOur identity becomes very wrapped up in being a tennis player. That\u2019s great, but when you have the tough kind of weeks, months, years on tour, that can really take a toll on how you think about yourself as a person,\u201d Keys, a 30-year-old American, said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSo being able to kind of dive into that and figure out how to separate the two and know that you\u2019re not just a tennis player, you're a full person that has all of these other really great attributes and other interests and just different things in your life.\u201d",
      "When a reporter asked the No. 3-seeded Zverev after his loss to unseeded Arthur Rinderknech on Tuesday whether he might consider trying therapy, the 28-year-old German replied: \u201cFor the first time in my life, I\u2019ll probably need it.\u201d",
      "This is how he described his current mindset: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It\u2019s not necessarily about tennis. Just lacking joy outside of tennis, as well.\u201d",
      "Andrey Rublev, a 10-time Slam quarterfinalist from Russia who is seeded 14th at Wimbledon, said after his win Wednesday that life on tour, in and of itself, is not the problem for someone like Zverev.",
      "\u201cTennis is just the trigger point,\u201d Rublev said. \u201cIt\u2019s something inside of you that you need to face.\u201d",

      "The PGA Tour is changing how it pays $100 million in bonus money for the FedEx Cup",
      "The PGA Tour has done away with the staggered start for the FedEx Cup finale. In its place is a new pay structure with staggered bonuses to whoever is leading at three points in the final month of the season.",
      "The FedEx Cup champion will get $10 million, down from $25 million. However, if the No. 1 seed would still get $25 million if he stays at the top throughout the playoffs.",
      "The bonus pool remains at $100 million under the structure released Wednesday.",
      "But instead of the FedEx Cup champion receiving $25 million at the end of the Tour Championship, the No. 1 player will get $10 million after the regular season ends with the Wyndham Champion. Whoever leads the FedEx Cup after the BMW Championship gets $5 million. And the Tour Championship winner gets $10 million.",
      "This caps an overhaul to what the PGA Tour hopes can lead to a more compelling \u2014 and less confusing \u2014 end to the season.",
      "The staggered start \u2014 also known as starting strokes \u2014 gave the No. 1 seed a two-shot lead at the Tour Championship by putting him at 10-under par before the tournament event started.",
      "Now the top 30 who reach East Lake will start even, just like any tournament, and whoever wins the Tour Championship is the FedEx Cup champion.",
      "To account for the winner-take-all nature of the Tour Championship, the pay structure was altered to make sure season-long performances were still rewarded, and top players did not get penalized too much for having a bad week at East Lake.",
      "Scottie Scheffler was so dominant last year he led the FedEx Cup all through the playoffs, picking up the $25 million bonus as the champion.",
      "If the new payment structure had been in place in 2023, however, Jon Rahm would have received $10 million for leading the FedEx Cup going into the playoffs; Scheffler would have won $5 million for leading after the BMW Championship; and Viktor Hovland would have won $10 million for being the FedEx Cup champion.",
      "Rahm was the No. 1 seed starting the 2023 playoffs, tied for 18th in the Tour Championship and his postseason payout was $675,000. Under the new payment plan, Rahm would have received $12,208,750 for his FedEx Cup bonus \u2014 No. 1 going into the playoff, No. 4 after the BMW Championship and a tie for 21st in the Tour Championship.",
      "The Tour Championship effectively would have a $40 million purse, but the bonus money still will count as unofficial.",
      "The FedEx Cup points for the FedEx St. Jude Championship and the BMW Championship will remain quadruple the value to allow for movement in the standings.",
      "The Comcast Business Tour Top 10 is still around, a $40 million bonus pool for the regular season. So for this year, whoever leads the FedEx Cup going into the postseason would get $10 million from the FedEx Cup bonus and $8 million from Comcast.",

      "In his prime from 2010-15, Kershaw led the National League in ERA five times, in strikeouts three times and wins twice.",
      "Kershaw had one of the best seasons ever in 2014, when he finished with a 21-3 record, 1.77 ERA and 233 strikeouts to win both the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player in the National League.",
      "Age and less dominant stuff has changed the way Kershaw does his job. He knows his consistency isn\u2019t the same but with the depth of the team\u2019s staff, he doesn\u2019t need to be perfect every outing.",
      "Kershaw no longer overpowers hitters the way he did during the height of his career, but he remains stubbornly determined and possesses a craftiness honed over two decades as well as a slider that still can fool.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen him grow more than any player,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHasn\u2019t lost the compete, but I think that the world is not as black and white as he used to see it. I think that his edges are softer, I think that fatherhood, Father Time, does that to a person.\u201d",

      "Brown would replace Tom Thibodeau, who was fired last month despite leading the Knicks to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years.",

      "The Knicks quickly identified Brown as a candidate they wanted to speak with, while also discussing the job with former Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins and current assistants James Borrego of New Orleans and Micah Nori of Minnesota before offering the position to Brown.",
      "Brown was honored with his first coaching award when he coached the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team he led to the NBA Finals in 2007 during his first stint with the organization. He also coached the Los Angeles Lakers and is 454-304 in his career.",
      "Brown also won four championships as an assistant coach, three with the Golden State Warriors and one under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio.",
      "His coaching staff will be discussed in the coming days, the person told AP.",
      "Thibodeau led the Knicks to their only sustained success of the 2000s, with four playoff appearances in his five seasons. They reached at least the East semifinals each of the last three seasons and reached 50 wins in both of the last two.",

      "LONDON -- For one game at least, it looked like Carlos Alcaraz could be in for another surprisingly tough encounter on Wimbledon\u2019s Centre Court.",
      "But after saving three break points in his opening service game against 733rd-ranked Ollie Tarvet, things got a bit more comfortable for the defending champion, who saw out a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 second-round win over the unheralded collegiate player from Britain.",
      "While he had to face another eight break points along the way \u2014 saving all but two \u2014 it was a considerably smoother win than his 4\u00bd hour, five-set victory over Fabio Fognini in the opening round.",
      "Still, Alcaraz couldn't help but be impressed with the University of San Diego student playing in his first Grand Slam tournament.",
      "\u201cI just love his game to be honest,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI knew at the beginning that I had to be really focused and try to play my best tennis.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz took his overall winning streak to 20 matches.",
      "After a slew of seeded players went out in the first round, he joined women's No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in advancing in straight sets on Wednesday.",
      "He will next face either 25th-seeded Felix Auger-Aliassime or Jan-Lennard Struff in the third round, as the Spaniard bids for a third straight Wimbledon title.",
      "Alcaraz has already established himself as a massive fan favorite at the All England Club, but this was the first time he faced a British player at the grass-court Grand Slam \u2014 meaning crowd support was pretty evenly split.",
      "\u201cI know it's not personal,\u201d Alcaraz said.",

      "The seats in the Royal Box behind one of the baselines are by invitation only, and there was quite a list of celebrities on hand for Day 3 of competition.",
      "\u201cI was trying not to look today,\u201d Sabalenka said about the collection of boldfaced names, explaining that she might be distracted while competing. \u201cI was just trying to focus on my game.

      "Malik Beasley should be riding high right now, after a season where he became just the fifth player in NBA history to make at least 300 shots from 3-point range in a single season.",
      "Instead, his future seems very uncertain.",
      "He's a free agent and facing some serious off-court issues \u2014 including being part of an investigation surrounding what's believed to be unusual betting patterns on games and now some unrelated legal matters involving his personal finances.",
      "Beasley was a key part of the Detroit Pistons this past season, averaging 16.3 points per game for a team that made the playoffs and was one of the feel-good stories in the NBA \u2014 winning 44 games after winning only 14 in the previous season.",
      "Some questions and answers about Beasley's current situations and his future:",
      "Beasley has not been charged with any crime. Federal investigators, who have not commented publicly, are looking into betting patterns surrounding some games Beasley played in during the 2023-24 season when he was with the Milwaukee Bucks.",
      "The primary focus of the probe is what are called \u201cprop bets,\u201d ones where bettors can wager if a player will go over or under a certain statistical total \u2014 like will he score more than 10.5 points, grab 5.5 or more rebounds, that sort of thing.",
      "It is similar to other investigations \u2014 such as the one that led to the banning of then-Toronto player Jontay Porter from the league. Terry Rozier, who plays for the Miami Heat, was a subject of a similar probe surrounding part of his time with the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier was never charged and never faced any penalty from the NBA.",
      "ESPN reported that one game in question surrounded Beasley's performance on Jan. 31, 2024, and in particular whether he would get more or less than 2.5 rebounds. Bettors, ESPN was told, wagered large sums that he would not get that many rebounds. But Beasley got six rebounds that night, meaning those \u201cunder\u201d bets did not pay out.",
      "News of the gambling probe broke on Sunday, followed by news of lawsuits two days later \u2014 including one brought by a sports representation agency that is seeking more than $2 million in damages.",
      "That suit, brought by Hazan Sports Management Group, says Beasley breached his contract and failed to fully repay a $650,000 advance, among other issues. Beasley and that agency parted ways in recent months, even though it negotiated a $6 million contract for him to play with the Pistons this past season.",
      "\u201cI have been with Malik for a long time, I have seen a lot of people around him come and go, but I have stayed away from any of his financial management or mismanagement or decisions he would make with money,\u201d Beasley\u2019s criminal defense lawyer, Steve Haney, told The Detroit News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m his lawyer. I don\u2019t get involved in his finances,\u201d Haney told the newspaper. \u201cYou hope to get them around the best business people and planners and management people. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Other issues that were revealed were issues with rent payments, along with a settlement with a dentist and even a barber who works with a number of NBA players.",
      "The NBA has seen a huge spike in dependency on the 3-point shot in recent years, and Beasley \u2014 who made 319 of them this past season, one back of Minnesota's Anthony Edwards for the most in the league \u2014 is an elite 3-point shooter.",
      "Only two players have made more than 1,000 3s over the last four seasons. Golden State's Stephen Curry, the league's all-time 3-point king, is one. Beasley is the other.",
      "This means Beasley should be in high demand, given the fact that he has a skill all teams crave. And the Pistons, according to a person with knowledge of the talks, were prepared to offer Beasley a three-year contract to stay. But given the seriousness of the issues that have come up in recent days, those talks cooled.",
      "On Tuesday, Detroit struck a deal to bring in former Miami guard Duncan Robinson \u2014 another elite 3-point shooter \u2014 after striking a three-year deal.",
      "Beasley is a free agent, meaning he can sign with any team. Outside of the off-court concerns, here's another problem: Very few teams have the means available under the salary cap to give a new player a contract in the range of what Beasley would be worth, which is probably in the $15 million annually range.",
      "He may have to accept something much, much smaller \u2014 possibly even a minimum deal of about $3 million \u2014 to have a chance with a team next season.",

      "Aryna Sabalenka has come back after being two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home.",
      "Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Zheng Qinwen and No. 9 Paula Badosa. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players \u2014 10 women, 13 men \u2014 were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years.",
      "\u201cOf course you're going to know the overall picture. ... I hope it\u2019s no upsets anymore in this tournament,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said afterward with a chuckle. \"If you know what I mean.\u201d",
      "She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month \u2014 drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week \u2014 but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club.",
      "A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder.",
      "On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C).",
      "At Centre Court, the 48th-ranked Bouzkova went ahead 6-5 in the first set with the match's initial service break thanks to a double-fault by Sabalenka. Bouzkova served for that set, and was two points away from it at 30-15 in that game, again at 30-all, then once more at deuce.",
      "But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout.",
      "\u201cThat was a tough moment,\" said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. \u201cUntil that point, (my) return wasn\u2019t great enough to break her serve. I'm really glad ... everything clicked together and I was able to break her back. I kind of like felt a little bit better.\u201d",
      "That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that.",
      "Sabalenka compiled a 41-17 edge in winners while making only 18 unforced errors in a match that lasted a little more than 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men.",
      "Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 major championships at Wimbledon will lead off the Centre Court schedule on Day 4 against Britain's Dan Evans at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), followed by Iga Swiatek vs. Caty McNally, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. Aleksandar Vukic.",

      "The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Kentucky by a woman who claims Hairston entered her dorm room without being invited, ignored her when she said didn't want to have sexual intercourse, forcibly removed her bottoms and sexually assaulted her. The Associated Press does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.",
      "Texts seeking comment Wednesday were sent to agents for Hairston.",

      "\u201cSo that\u2019s unfortunate when things like that are attached to someone\u2019s name. And in this case, doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there,\u201d Beane said.",
      "Hairston is from West Bloomfield, Michigan, and spent three seasons playing at Kentucky (2022-\u201924) before being selected by the Bills in the first round \u2014 30th overall \u2014 of the NFL draft in April. The 21-year-old Hairston is being given the opportunity to win a starting job at cornerback this season.",

      "The Lions are now two from two in five days in Australia after a 54-7 tour-opening win over Western Force in Perth on the weekend.",
      "On a cool, windy night in Brisbane, the Lions again took a while to get started, twice falling behind to early tries before turning a 12-7 deficit into a 21-12 halftime lead.",
      "Skipper Itoje, who was rested for the first game, ran powerfully onto an inside pass from scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park five minutes after the break to crack the game open, with the Lions scoring three tries in 15 minutes.",
      "The Lions were determined to play with pace and high-tempo, spreading the ball to the edges regularly and maintaining a positive attacking shape to generate space and scoring opportunities.",
      "\u201cAs a team we just wanted to be better today, take a step forward. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a step in the right direction,\u201d Itoje said of his first win as Lions captain. \"I think we were a little bit more clinical, sharper, a little bit more accurate on the ball.",
      "\u201cWe still made quite a few errors ball in hand, but I thought it was better in that regard.\u201d",
      "Flyhalf Finn Russell again orchestrated the Lions attack before he was rested after 55 minutes.",
      "Winger Tommy Freeman was a beneficiary of the attacking mindset, scoring two tries, while Bundy Ake created opportunities in midfield and openside flanker Jac Morgan put in a player-of-the-match performance in a dominant forward pack, including a try.",
      "Huw Jones plucked an attempted chip kick out of the air and sprinted 60 meters to make it 47-12 and Garry Ringrose capped it off with a try five minutes into stoppage time.",
      "The Lions have now won back-to-back matches after slipping to a 28-24 loss to Argentina in a warmup in Dublin before traveling to Australia for a nine-game tour, which includes three tests against the Wallabies on July 19, 26 and Aug. 2.",

      "Irish fullback Hugo Keenan was ruled out just ahead of the match and replaced by Elliot Daly, who scored two tries in the win over Western Force. Daly hurt his left forearm in a tackle late in the second half and didn't finish the match.",

      "The pressure paid off in the 20th when the Lions created an overlap and spread the ball wide for Freeman to score untouched.",
      "The Reds, playing in maroon and navy colors, were missing a host of starting players on duty for Australia's test against Fiji on Sunday, but still threatened regularly.",
      "Center Josh Flook swooped onto a short, stabbed grubber kick from scrumhalf Kalani Thomas as the Lions defense rushed up, collected the half-volley and dived over to give the Reds a 12-7 lead after 25 minutes.",
      "The Lions went within inches of scoring two minutes later but couldn't ground the ball. There was no doubt over prop Andrew Porter's barging try from close range in the 29th, though, and the Lions regained the lead 14-12.",
      "The Lions took a quick tap in the 35th after the Reds were penalized for a hand in the scrum and spread it wide quickly for Duhan van der Merwe to dive inside the left corner post. It was all the Lions after that.",

      "BIRMINGHAM, England -- India was 98-2 at lunch after being made to bat first by England to start the second test at Edgbaston on Wednesday.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal was 62 not out, after Lokesh Rahul chopped on to his stumps on 2 early on, and Karun Nair was out minutes before lunch when he picked out second slip.",
      "Rahul's wicket was reward for England's tight bowling on a dry, batter-friendly pitch under sunny skies.",
      "Then Nair's ambition sparked Jaiswal out of uncharacteristic caution and they accelerated to hit 16 boundaries in a stand of 80 runs off 90 balls.",
      "But Nair's wicket stopped the session from being dominated by India.",
      "Captain Shubman Gill was with Jaiswal on 1.",
      "The first hour was attritional for India, with England seamer Chris Woakes particularly effective.",
      "He got Rahul out and had big lbw shouts against Jaiswal on 12 and Nair on 5. Both times the ball was tracking to clip the top of off stump but the batters survived on umpire calls.",
      "Nair was promoted from No. 6 in the batting order to No. 3 for the first time in a test and quickly passed Jaiswal's score by driving at Woakes and Josh Tongue.",
      "Jaiswal was unusually strangled but didn't give England the mistake it was waiting for. He opened up in the second hour by smashing fuller-length deliveries to the boundary by Tongue and Ben Stokes.",
      "His rising confidence brought out his imagination, including an overhead volley smash of Stokes to the boundary. He brought up his 50 with his 10th boundary \u2014 an overhead cut, on his toes, off Tongue. His 16th 50-plus score in his 21st test came off 58 balls.",

      "TOKYO -- Plans to demolish a historic baseball stadium where Babe Ruth played and an adjacent rugby venue are at the heart of a disputed park redevelopment in Tokyo that critics say trades history and greenery for commercial space.",
      "The plan to remake the Jingu Gaien park area was approved 2 1/2 years ago by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Work clearing land has begun but opponents are still trying to stop the project, which could take a decade to complete.",
      "A coalition on Wednesday presented an open letter to Toshiko Abe, the minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, asking the project be reassessed.",
      "It's signed by 368 experts \u2014 urban planners, architects and environmental scientists \u2014 and 1,167 others.",
      "The park area was established a century ago through public donations to honor the Meiji Emperor. At the heart of the issue is citizens' control of public space, and a potential conflict of interest with private developers and politicians deciding how valuable parcels are used.",
      "The stadium oozes history and critics say building skyscrapers in the park space would never be allowed in Central Park in New York or Hyde Park in London.",
      "Ruth and Lou Gehrig played at the stadium on a 1934 barnstorming tour. Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami was inspired to write his first novel while drinking beer and watching a game there in 1978. The stadium is still home to the Yakult Swallows baseball team and hosted a concert this week.",
      "Plans call for developers to build a pair of 200-meter (650-feet) towers and a smaller tower. The stadiums are to be rebuilt in the reconfigured space with the baseball stadium going where the rugby stadium now stands.",
      "The open letter is critical of so-called private finance schemes that give private developers access to park space. Hibiya Park is Tokyo's oldest public park, another example of this approach.",
      "Opposition to the Jingu redevelopment has included novelist Murakami, a conservancy group, and botanists and environmentalists who argue the sprawling project threatens 100-year-old gingko trees that grace the area's main avenue.",
      "A global conservancy body ICOMOS, which works with the United Nations body UNESCO, has said the development will lead to \u201cirreversible destruction of cultural heritage\u201d with trees and green space being lost.",
      "Opposition groups are pitted against powerful real-estate developer Mitsui Fudosan, the Shinto religious body, and Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that many Japanese citizens are not so much interested in democratically regulating their own city and are used to demolishing buildings,\u201d Kohei Saito, a Japanese political economist at Tokyo University, wrote to The Associated Press.",
      "He said \u201ccompanies with political power try to maximize their short-term profits without consideration of Tokyo's attractiveness (history, culture), inhabitants' well-being and future generations.\u201d",
      "Zoning changes to allow high-rise buildings in the area were made around 2013 by the Tokyo government when the city won the bid for the 2020 Olympics. Many of those changes permitted building the neighboring National Stadium but also applied to the park area.",
      "\u201cThe process of rezoning the area lacked transparency and democratic procedure and constitutes an illegal abuse of the governor\u2019s discretion in urban planning decisions,\u201d the open letter said.",
      "The Jingu district was considered \u201ccommon property\u201d until after World War II when the government sold it to Shinto under a promise it would remain a common space.",
      "The national government comes into play because the rugby venue is the property of the Japan Sport Council, a national government affiliated body. The rugby venue represents about 30% of the Jingu Gaien area.",
      "Opponents hope the timing later this month of a national election might aid their cause with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba heading a minority government.",
      "Former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has ties to the rugby venue.",
      "In addition to serving two decades ago as prime minister, he is the former president of the Japan Rugby Football Union and also served as the president of the 2020 Olympic organizing committee until he was forced to resign after making sexist comments about women.",
      "Opened in 1926, developers argue the baseball stadium is too old to save. However, Fenway Park in Boston dates from 1912 and Wrigley Field in Chicago from 1914. Both have been refurbished and are among the most venerated in the United States.",
      "Meiji Kinenkan, a historic reception hall in Jingu Gaien, dates from 1881 and is still widely used with no calls for its demolition. Mitsui Fudosan\u2019s headquarters building in Tokyo dates from 1929. Koshien Stadium, located near Osaka, was built in 1924 and has been in use since a refurbishment.",
      "The new rugby stadium would be an indoor venue with plastic grass, which players view as the least desirable surface for the sport.",

      "Ehlers and his camp watched Tuesday as fellow winger Brock Boeser re-signed in Vancouver for just over $50 million and older forward Mikael Granlund got $7 million annually from Anaheim. With the salary cap increasing a record amount to $95.5 million and a lack of high-end talent available, Ehlers could sign the most lucrative contract among players changing teams this summer.",

      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology",
      "The startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.",
      "Formed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.",
      "But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.",
      "Jimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.",
      "\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d",
      "Gigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.",
      "The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.",
      "Gigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.",
      "Carbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.",
      "Only a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.",
      "The credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.",
      "And it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.",
      "The startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.",
      "Shaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Under his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.",
      "Chief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.",
      "Markus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.",
      "\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "A spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d",
      "The company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.",
      "In social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d",
      "The particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.",
      "\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Algae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.",
      "The ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Gigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.",
      "Later, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.",
      "While Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "Documents provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.",
      "In the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.",
      "A patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.",
      "Without specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.",
      "When asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.",
      "The company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.",
      "Shaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.",
      "\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Buesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.",
      "\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Several scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.",
      "The success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.",
      "Thomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.",
      "It\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.",
      "\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d",
      "The rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.",
      "It\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.",
      "Boyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.",
      "\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.",
      "James Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.",
      "The company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.",
      "In a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.",
      "Whether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.",
      "Puro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.",
      "Amid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.",
      "The Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.",
      "In part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.",
      "But the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.",
      "In June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.",
      "Marianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.",
      "But like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.",
      "Pallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.",
      "Pallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.",
      "How authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.",
      "More than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.",
      "Iron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.",
      "The startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.",
      "\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "But the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.",
      "Other scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d",
      "For now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.",
      "\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- The nonprofit that operates Shriners Children's hospitals across North America will locate a $153 million medical research facility in Atlanta, the group announced Wednesday.",
      "Shriners Children\u2019s Research Institute intends to conduct research into cell and gene therapies, other biotechnology therapies, robotics, artificial intelligence, medical devices and the study of data.",
      "Shriners Children's operates 17 hospitals in the United States and one each in Mexico and Canada, plus clinics. The system is owned by Shriners International, a Masonic order. It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",

      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away.",
      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",
      "\u201cThe numbers weren\u2019t as bad as thought with all the analyst forecast cuts we saw over the past week,\u201d said Morningstar's Seth Goldstein, though he added the report overall showed the company faces big challenges. \u201cThe current product lineup is at market saturation and Tesla will need the new affordable vehicle to grow deliveries.\u201d",
      "Musk has promised a cheaper EV model would be coming this year that would boost sales.",
      "It's not clear yet if Musk's latest feud with Trump will help lure back buyers who have been angry at the billionaire's political positions. After Musk once again took to social media to criticize Trump's budget bill, the president threatened Tuesday to use the power of his office to hurt his companies, including Tesla, pushing its stock down more than 5%.",
      "A June AP-NORC poll showed about half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans.",
      "The new figures come as Tesla is focusing less on new models and more on robots, self-driving technology and robotaxis ferrying passengers around without anyone behind the wheel.",
      "Tesla is in the midst of a test run of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, that seems to have gone smoothly for the most part. But it also has drawn the scrutiny of federal car safety regulators because of a few mishaps, including one case in which a Tesla cab was shown on a video heading down an opposing lane.",
      "The competition from rival EV makers is especially fierce in Europe where China's BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. Tesla sales fell 28% in May in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla's best selling Model Y. That new version has been out for months now.",

      "A U.S. judge has ruled that China's Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes",
      "BANGKOK -- A U.S. judge has ruled that China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei\u2019s request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there.",
      "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks.",
      "In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.",
      "Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.",
      "Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of \u201ceconomic bullying\u201d and of improperly using national security as a pretext for \u201coppressing Chinese companies.\u201d In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were \u201dimpermissibly extraterritorial,\" and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud.",
      "The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies.",
      "The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.",

      "Martin Cooper changed the world when he pioneered the portable phone",
      "DEL MAR, Calif. -- Dick Tracy got an atom-powered two-way wrist radio in 1946. Marty Cooper never forgot it.",
      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",
      "Tabane Ciss\u00e9, who moved from Senegal to Spain in 2023, makes phone calls about investing Spanish earnings at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s all texts, or voice notes, with one exception.",
      "His mother doesn\u2019t read or write, but when he calls \u201cit\u2019s as if I was standing next to her,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cIt brings back memories \u2014 such pleasure.\u201d",
      "He couldn\u2019t do it without the cell phone. And half a world away, that suits Marty Cooper just fine.",
      "\u201cThere are more cell phones in the world today than there are people,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cYour life can be made infinitely more efficient just by virtue of being connected with everybody else in the world. But I have to tell you that this is only the beginning.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal.

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans' massive tax and spending bill will affect millions of Americans, particularly vulnerable populations, but some of those impacts won't be felt for some time.",
      "The bill's current language staggers the start date for tax changes and the federal budget until after the November 2026 elections. Some expire at the end of Trump's term in office.",
      "Here is a look at when you'll start to see the impact of the bill:",
      "Though Trump campaigned on protecting Medicaid, the program that provides health care for low-income and elderly Americans is one of the largest federal programs targeted in the bill.",
      "The bill imposes new 80-hour per month work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who don't have dependents. These requirements include working or other approved activities, such as volunteering.",
      "There are exemptions for parents or guardians of children under age 14 and those with disabilities.",
      "These work requirements won't kick in until 2026.",
      "Health policy experts say the population of able bodied Americans on Medicaid who don\u2019t work is fairly small \u2014 but that many more might lose their coverage because of the burdensome paperwork requirements that will come with regularly proving work status.",
      "Another Medicaid funding cut will come from a change to provider taxes, or taxes on health care organizations, which states use to fund their Medicaid programs. The biggest impacts will felt through the closing of health centers in rural areas, health care employers say, because there are already longstanding struggles to stay open for many of them.",
      "Health policy experts and health care workers say the biggest impacts will felt through the closing of health centers throughout the country, especially in rural areas that were heavily funded by Medicaid. Others will lose coverage because of the work requirements and the additional paperwork required under the bill.",
      "The original measure passed by the House made around $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid, but that grew with the Senate bill: new estimates from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office project federal spending on Medicaid will be reduced by $1 trillion and the number of uninsured people will increase by nearly 12 million by 2034.",
      "The Senate added a $50 billion rural hospital fund to the package to placate senators who had concerns about the impact of Medicaid cuts on their constituents, but it's unclear how the funding will be distributed or whether it will be sufficient to make up the anticipated shortfall from changes to the Medicaid provider tax.",
      "There are also proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act that take effect in 2026 and could result in millions more people losing coverage, increasing the number to 17 million.",
      "Under the bill, automatic renewal processes would be eliminated and open market insurance applicants would also be subjected to more paperwork.",
      "The bill changes work requirements for adults who are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, which would greatly reduce the number of eligible Americans.",
      "The bill raises the work requirement age from 54 to 64 and adds parents with children older than 6. Parents with dependent children at home, regardless of age, are currently exempt from these requirements.",
      "Those changes will go into effect as early as this year.",
      "The Republican spending bill also forces states to shoulder at least 5% of SNAP benefit costs starting in 2028. Currently, the program is 100% federally funded.",
      "The SNAP cuts total an estimated $230 billion over 10 years.",
      "Some of the tax changes will go into effect this year and be reflected when Americans file their taxes in 2026.",
      "The bill allows tax deductions on tips and overtime pay. Deductions on tips is capped at $25,000 per year while deductions on overtime is capped at $12,500 per year.",
      "The standard deduction would rise by $750 for single filers and $1,500 for those filing jointly.",
      "One of the biggest changes was the state and local taxes (SALT) deduction, which allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes in their filing, including property taxes.",
      "Trump's 2017 tax bill capped the deduction at $10,000. The 2025 spending bill increases the cap to $40,000 for households making under $500,000 and will rise 1% every year until 2029.",
      "The cap resets to $10,000 in 2030.",

They can take responsibility,\" Kennedy said during a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Health. \"They can see, as you know, what food is doing to their glucose levels, their heart rates and a number of other metrics as they eat it. and they can begin to make good judgments about their diet, about their physical activity, about the way that they live their lives.\"",
      "He went on, \"We think that wearables are a key to the MAHA agenda -- Making America Healthy Again. My vision is that every American is wearing a wearable within four years.\"",
      "Digital medicine experts told ABC News that wearables do have benefits and can be used to motivate someone to increase physical activity, which could reduce the risk of poor health outcomes.",
      "However, they said not everybody needs to have a wearable and there are some potential risks including data breaches.",
      "Nabil Alshurafa, an associate professor in the department of preventive medicine and the department of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern University in Illinois, said wearables were born out of the quantified self movement.",
      "This is a movement that endorses using technology to track and analyze personal data for learning and improvement.",
      "\"Just the way when we're driving a vehicle, we see whether we're low on gas, and then we pass by the gas station and repump,\" Alshurafa told ABC News. \"So, the idea was sort of can I see when I'm active? Not active? Can I see when I have poor health habits and then adjust accordingly. Did I have good quality asleep last night? If not, let me try to improve that.\"",
      "He said there are benefits to wearables, mostly in the form of motivation to change behaviors.",
      "A July 2022 study found wearables can empower patients and help with diagnosing conditions, changing behaviors and self-monitoring.",
      "Additionally, a July 2019 study from the University of Florida in Gainesville found wearable devices can motivate and accelerate physical activity, although it did not find consistent improvement in health outcomes.",
      "Dr. David McManus, chair and professor of medicine at UMass Chan Medical School and a digital medicine expert, said an example would be if someone wants to walk 10,000 steps a day and they wear an activity monitor that tells them they only walked 5,000 steps on a particular day. This might motivate that person to walk further to achieve their goal.",
      "In turn, evidence shows people who are more physically active have fewer rates of heart attacks and are less likely to develop high blood pressure or obesity.",
      "\"The benefit would be if a person actually used that information to change their behavior,\" he told ABC News. \"That would be the clearest use case of a person using a wearable to learn. \u2026 I won't say there's convincing concrete evidence that a wearable will prevent heart attacks -- I would be uncomfortable saying that -- but I do think it's reasonable on the basis of preliminary studies and observational studies, there is some potential benefit for certain types of people from wearing devices to get people motivated to change.\"",
      "Alshurafa said clinicians can also receive more granular data about behaviors such as how much energy patients are expending and how many calories they are burning.",
      "It's unclear if Kennedy's connections have played a role in his endorsements of wearables. U.S. surgeon general nominee Casey Means co-founded Levels, an app that allows people to track their food, along with biometric data like sleep and glucose monitoring, to see how their diet is impacting their health.",
      "Additionally, her brother, Calley Means -- an adviser to Kennedy -- has a company that could benefit from more wearables in the world. His company, TruMed, allows people to use funds from Health Savings Accounts towards health products, such as fitness tracker watches.",
      "There are also drawbacks. McManus said there is not a high level of evidence that shows wearables have benefits over the long term.",
      "\"One thing I've learned as a physician and researcher is it's really hard to get people to change their habits,\" he said. \"So it's not so much that the sensors don't work, and it's not so much that they're inaccurate -- because there is plenty of data that shows that wearable devices can present really good, high-quality data -- but the missing link in the chain of wearables to good health is getting people to actually get off their couch and go be more active when they have a wearable them that they've been on the couch.\"",
      "There are also privacy concerns because of the substantial amounts of data that wearables generate, as well as the potential for misuse.",
      "McManus said if a database gets hacked, the data could be compromised and potentially used by a bad actor to steal additional personal information.",
      "\"The more data that's generated, the greater the risk,\" he said.",
      "Authors of a JAMA Viewpoint article in 2019 said another risk is that data could be used against policyholders with higher premiums or to deny insurance.",
      "Because wearables collect health information such as weight, calorie intake and blood pressure, insurance companies could use the data to increase costs, the authors said.",
      "Alshurafa said not everyone needs to wear a wearable and it depends on the patient's condition and what they hope to achieve.",
      "\"We feel once their health improves, we then wean them off it,\" he said. \"So, this notion that someone has to wear a wearable constantly -- well, I mean once the problem is solved, then hopefully there's no need for it.\"",

    "summary": "More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing an amicus brief on Thursday opposing the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education.",
    "story": [
      "\"The law couldn't be clearer,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said.",
      "More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing an amicus brief on Thursday opposing the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "\u201cThe law couldn't be clearer: the president does not have the authority to unilaterally abolish the Department of Education,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote in a statement first obtained by ABC News, adding, \u201cDonald Trump is not a king, and he cannot single-handedly cut off access to education for students across this country.\u201d",
      "Warren and ranking committee members Jamie Raskin on Judiciary, Bobby Scott on Education, and Rosa DeLauro on Appropriations lead the 15-page legal document. They\u2019re joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, more than 20 Senate Democrats, and more than 150 other members of the House Democratic caucus.",
      "The lawmakers\u2019 brief attempting to block the administration from abolishing the Department of Education is in support of the NAACP's suit against the government this past spring. In March, that case argued that downsizing the department through a workforce reduction that slashed nearly half the agency\u2019s staff -- among other measures like terminating statutory grant programs -- violates the separation of powers and lacks constitutional authority.",
      "The NAACP, the National Education Association (NEA), and a coalition of groups filed a preliminary injunction with the U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland this week, arguing the judge\u2019s consideration of this case is needed after the administration\u2019s recent decision to pause more than $6 billion in congressionally appropriated education programs ahead of the school year.",
      "\u201cThe motion seeks a remedy for the serious harm that the Trump Administration has inflicted on students, educators, schools, and colleges and universities, and asks the Court to direct the Department to fulfill its statutory obligations to students nationwide,\u201d according to a statement released by the NEA, which represents more than 3 million educators.",
      "Raskin condemned the administration\u2019s efforts to curb public education, contending President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon can\u2019t abolish the agency without congressional approval.",
      "\u201cCongress created the Department of Education to ensure that every student in America could obtain a high-quality, free public school education,\u201d Raskin wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is the right of every citizen and an essential democratic safeguard against political tyranny,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo president has the authority to dismantle a federal agency created by law. We're going to court to defend not only congressional power but the department\u2019s national educational mission, itself a pillar of American democracy,\u201d Raskin added.",
      "The power to reorganize the executive branch belongs to Congress and is underscored by the fact that when presidents have reorganized the executive branch, they have done so \u201cthrough legislation and subject to appropriate restraints,\u201d according to the brief by the lawmakers.",
      "Their brief argues that only Congress has the authority to create, restructure, and abolish federal agencies, it has to be done through legislation, and the Department of Education can\u2019t be unilaterally abolished because it\u2019s statutorily mandated.",
      "Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colorado, told ABC News closing the department would strip \u201cvital support\u201d from tens of millions of students and teachers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with my colleagues in the House and Senate to uphold Congress\u2019 responsibility to ensure every student has access to a quality education and to defend the essential work of the Department of Education,\u201d Neguse said.",
      "Efforts to dismantle the department have been blocked by lower courts this spring. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a Massachusetts case that could decide whether the firing of nearly 2,000 employees at the agency stands. McMahon has stressed the critical functions of the department remain and that services like students with disabilities, for example, could ultimately be moved to other agencies.",
      "The brief is part of Warren\u2019s larger Save Our Schools campaign that she started after Trump signed an executive order to diminish the Department of Education.",
      "\"The federal government has invested in our public schools,\" Warren told ABC News in April. \"Taking that away from our kids so that a handful of billionaires can be even richer is just plain ugly, and I will fight it with everything I've got.\"",
      "The senator has previously requested the agency's Office of Inspector General review the Department of Government Efficiency's alleged \"infiltration\" of the agency's internal federal student loan database. Prior to the Save Our Schools campaign, she investigated the firing of federal student aid employees and how a reduction in staff at the agency could have \"dire consequences\" for borrowers.",
      "The brief also comes after Raskin and several other House Democrats met with McMahon about the future of the agency. That meeting appeared to leave many with unanswered questions, like Rep. Frederica Wilson, a senior member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, who also signed on to the amicus brief.",
      "\"For the Department of Education to be dismantled, it is going to bring a shock to this nation,\" said Wilson, a former principal and lifelong educator. \"Schools are the bedrock of this nation. When schools are working, our country is, too.\"",

      "Reports have suggested that DHS plans to cut the I&A workforce by close to 75%.",
      "The top Democrats on the House and Senate Homeland Security committees, as well as on the Intelligence Committee, also warned against the cuts.",
      "\"Radically reducing I&A's workforce at headquarters or in the field would create dangerous and unnecessary security gaps and could again leave us in the dark about the threats that lie ahead,\" Rep. Jim Himes, Rep. Bennie Thompson and Sen. Gary Peters said in a letter to Noem.",
      "The groups said that they \"fully recognize\" the need for the intelligence apparatus to adapt to meet its current needs -- which they said they are support.",
      "\"At the same time, we believe that changes of this magnitude must be shaped through dialogue with those who rely on I&A every day -- especially given its unique role in connecting the federal intelligence community with frontline public safety agencies.\"",
      "In response to the letter, a DHS spokesperson said the agency is focusing on returning to its core mission.",
      "\"DHS component leads have identified redundant positions and non-critical programs within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to deliver a \u201cspectacular\u201d yearlong birthday party to mark 250 years of American independence. On Thursday, he will be in the U.S. heartland to kick off the patriotic festivities leading up to next year\u2019s anniversary.",
      "The event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines will feature \u201cdazzling\u201d displays of Americana and American history, musical performances and a fireworks show to cap the night, said U.S. Ambassador Monica Crowley, Trump\u2019s liaison to the organizing group, America250.",
      "Organizers see the coming year of festivities as a way to help unite a polarized nation and bridge partisanship \u2014 a monumental task given the country's divides. Thursday's event comes as the Republican-controlled Congress pushed for final passage of a sweeping tax cuts and spending package that's at the heart of Trump's legislative agenda but has united all Democrats against it. More U.S. adults also disapprove than approve of how the Republican president is doing his job.",
      "Iowa was a \u201clogical choice\u201d for the kickoff, Crowley said, because of its central location and Trump's affinity for the state, which supported him in each of the last three general elections. She also said Iowa's middle-of-the-country geography is symbolic of the desire to use the coming celebrations to help bring people together.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had so much division and so much polarization over the last many decades, but certainly over the last few years, that to be able to bring the country together to celebrate America\u2019s 250th birthday through patriotism, shared values and a renewed sense of civic pride, to be able to do that in the center of the country, is incredibly important,\u201d she said.",
      "A recent Gallup poll showed the widest partisan split in patriotism in over two decades, with only about a third of Democrats saying they are proud to be American compared with about 9 in 10 Republicans.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump's performance as president, according to a June AP-NORC poll, while about 6 in 10 disapprove. That poll also showed a majority of Americans said the June military parade that Trump greenlit in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army \u2014 an event that fell on his 79th birthday \u2014 was \u201cnot a good use\u201d of government money.",
      "Crowley spoke to the political and ideological schisms that left the country \u201ctorn apart\u201d ahead of its last big birthday celebration, noting that 1976 closely followed the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led Richard Nixon to resign from the presidency.",
      "\u201cThat moment was critical to uniting the country and moving forward, and I am very optimistic and hopeful that the yearlong celebration that we\u2019re about to launch will do the same thing in this present moment,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "America's 250th birthday \u201cis something that I think that all Americans can come together to celebrate and honor our history as well as our present and our future,\u201d Crowley said.",
      "On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, officially marking the 13 colonies' split from Great Britain.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a big, big celebration, as you know, 250 years,\u201d Trump said about the birthday during his Memorial Day address to a solemn audience at Arlington National Cemetery. \u201cIn some ways, I\u2019m glad I missed that second term where it was because I wouldn\u2019t be your president for that.\"",
      "Video of then-candidate Trump proposing a \u201cGreat American State Fair\u201d in Iowa in May 2023 began to recirculate after his reelection last November. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, told the White House earlier this year that Iowa stood \u201cready\" to host the event and that Trump had the state's full support, according to a draft of Reynolds' letter obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The culminating fair instead will be held next year on the National Mall in Washington, according to a White House official who was not authorized to share details publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. But Trump honored his initial proposal with a kickoff in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.",
      "The lineup Thursday night will include Lee Greenwood, according to social media posts advertising the event, whose song, \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d is a regular feature at Trump rallies and official events.

      "The French city of Cannes is banning cruise ships carrying over 1,000 passengers from its harbor starting next year",
      "PARIS -- The French Riviera resort of Cannes is imposing what its city council calls \u201cdrastic regulation\u201d on cruise ships, banning any vessels carrying more than 1,000 people from its harbor starting next year.",
      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",
      "\u201cLess numerous, less big, less polluting and more esthetic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the aim of Cannes city councilors who voted Friday to introduce new limits on cruise ships in its ports starting Jan. 1. Only ships with fewer than 1,000 passengers will be allowed in the port, with a maximum of 6,000 passengers disembarking per day. Larger ships will be expected to transfer passengers to smaller boats to enter Cannes.",
      "France \u2014 which drew in some 100 million visitors last year, more than any other European country and more than the country\u2019s population \u2014 is on the front line of efforts to balance economic benefits of tourism with environmental concerns while managing ever-growing crowds.",
      "\u201cCannes has become a major cruise ship destination, with real economic benefits. It\u2019s not about banning cruise ships, but about regulating, organizing, setting guidelines for their navigation,\u201d Mayor David Lisnard said in a statement.",
      "Cruise operators have called such restrictions damaging for destinations and for passengers.",
      "Two cruise ships were scheduled to dock in Cannes on Sunday, each bigger than the upcoming 1,000-passenger limit and with a combined capacity of more than 7,000 people. Their owners did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new restrictions.",
      "The nearby Mediterranean city of Nice announced limits on cruise ships earlier this year, as have some other European cities.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of protesters have denounced President Donald Trump as a would-be autocrat and marched under the banner \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Alarmed by the policies of President Donald Trump, millions turned out last month for protests around the United States and overseas. Mindful of next year\u2019s 250th anniversary of American independence, organizers called the movement \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "Had the same kind of rallies been called for in the summer of 1775, the response likely would have been more cautious.",
      "\u201cIt ('No Kings') was probably a minority opinion in July 1775,\u201d says H.W. Brands, a prize-winning scholar and chair of the history department at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of passion for revolution in New England, but that was different from the rest of the country,\u201d says Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joseph Ellis. \u201cThere were still people who don't want to drawn into what they feared was an unnecessary war.\u201d",
      "This month marks the 250th anniversary \u2014 the semiquincentennial \u2014 of a document enacted almost exactly a year before the Declaration of Independence: \u201cThe Olive Branch Petition,\u201d ratified July 5, 1775 by the Continental Congress. Its primary author was John Dickinson, a Pennsylvanian whose writing skills led some to call him the \u201cPenman of the Revolution,\u201d and would stand as a final, desperate plea to reconcile with Britain.",
      "The notion of \u201cNo Kings\u201d is a foundation of democracy. But over the first half of 1775 Dickinson and others still hoped that King George III could be reasoned with and would undo the tax hikes and other alleged abuses they blamed on the British Parliament and other officials. Ellis calls it the \u201cAwkward Interval,\u201d when Americans had fought the British in Lexington and Concord and around Bunker Hill, while holding off from a full separation.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion is changing during this time, but it still would have been premature to issue a declaration of independence,\u201d says Ellis, whose books include \u201cFounding Brothers,\u201d \u201cThe Cause\u201d and the upcoming \u201cThe Great Contradiction.\"",
      "The Continental Congress projected unity in its official statements. But privately, like the colonies overall, members differed. Jack Rakove, a professor of history at Stanford University and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cOriginal Meanings,\u201d noted that delegates to Congress ranged from \u201cradicals\u201d such as Samuel Adams who were avid for independence to such \u201cmoderates\u201d as Dickinson and New York's John Jay.",
      "The Olive Branch resolution balanced references to \u201cthe delusive pretences, fruitless terrors, and unavailing severities\u201d administered by British officials with dutiful tributes to shared ties and to the king's \u201croyal magnanimity and benevolence.\u201d",
      "\u201c(N)otwithstanding the sufferings of your loyal Colonists during the course of this present controversy, our Breasts retain too tender a regard for the Kingdom from which we derive our Origin to request such a Reconciliation as might in any manner be inconsistent with her Dignity or her welfare,\u201d the sometimes obsequious petition reads in part.",
      "The American Revolution didn\u2019t arise at a single moment but through years of anguished steps away from the \u201cmother\u201d country \u2014 a kind of weaning that at times suggested a coming of age, a young person\u2019s final departure from home. In letters and diaries written in the months before July 1775, American leaders often referred to themselves as children, the British as parents and the conflict a family argument.",
      "Edmund Pendleton, a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress, urged \u201ca reconciliation with Our mother Country.\u201d Jay, who would later help negotiate the treaty formally ending the Revolutionary War, proposed informing King George that \u201cyour majesty\u2019s American subjects\u201d are \u201cbound to your majesty by the strongest ties of allegiance and affection and attached to their parent country by every bond that can unite societies.\u201d",
      "In the Olive Branch paper, Dickinson would offer tribute to \u201cthe union between our Mother country and these colonies.\u201d",
      "The Congress, which had been formed the year before, relied in the first half of 1775 on a dual strategy that now might be called \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d a blend of resolve and compromise. John Adams defined it as \u201cto hold the sword in one hand, the olive branch in the other.\u201d Dickinson's petition was a gesture of peace. A companion document, \u201cThe Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms,\" was a statement of resolve.",
      "The 1775 declaration was drafted by Thomas Jefferson, who a year later would be the principal writer of the Declaration of Independence, revised by Dickinson and approved by the Congress on July 6. The language anticipated the Declaration of Independence with its condemnation of the British for \u201ctheir intemperate Rage for unlimited Domination\u201d and its vows to \u201cmake known the Justice of our Cause.\u201d",
      "But while the Declaration of Independence ends with the 13 colonies \u201cabsolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\u201d the authors in 1775 assured a nervous public \u201cthat we mean not to dissolve that Union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored.\u201d",
      "\u201cNecessity has not yet driven us into that desperate Measure, or induced us to excite any other Nation to war against them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "John Adams and Benjamin Franklin were among the peers of Dickinson who thought him naive about the British, and were unfazed when the king refused even to look at the Olive Branch petition and ruled that the colonies were in a state of rebellion. Around the same time Dickinson was working on his draft, the Continental Congress readied for further conflict. It appointed a commander of the newly-formed Continental Army, a renowned Virginian whom Adams praised as \u201cmodest and virtuous ... amiable, generous and brave.\"",
      "His name: George Washington. His ascension, Adams wrote, \"will have a great effect, in cementing and securing the Union of these Colonies.\u201d",

      "States and rural health advocacy groups are sounding the alarm that Congress\u2019 slashing of Medicaid will devastate already financially fragile rural hospitals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.",
      "Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.",
      "\u201cOur budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it\u2019ll be difficult to keep the doors open,\u201d said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.",
      "If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.",
      "\u201cThat's a long way for an emergency,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cSome won't make it.\u201d",
      "States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid \u2014 a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.",
      "More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.",
      "Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, \u201cit's going to be an emergency.\u201d",
      "Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday \u2014 estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years \u2014 would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball\u2019s current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that\u2019s even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.",
      "\u201cAn emergency means I\u2019m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that\u2019s a problem,\" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got, I\u2019m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that\u2019s probably already stretched thin.\u201d",
      "Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs \u2014 cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.",
      "But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.",
      "\u201cWe see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,\" Cochran-McClain said. \"Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer \u2014 especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding \u2014 is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.\u201d",
      "A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.",
      "The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion \u2014 nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.",
      "Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.",
      "\u201cHalf of Kentucky\u2019s kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,\u201d Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. \u201cThis is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.\"",

      "The U.S. military wants to continue live-fire training at Pohakuloa, a high-altitude plateau on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island",
      "HONOLULU -- A high-altitude plateau on the Big Island is the only place in Hawaii where thousands of ground forces can practice firing live munitions. It's also a place many Native Hawaiians consider the spiritual heart of the island.",
      "The U.S. military wants to keep training at this spot, called Pohakuloa, so it's ready to quickly send troops to Asia and the Pacific. Its importance to the U.S. is only growing as China becomes more assertive, particularly regarding Taiwan.",
      "But the Army's lease for state lands beneath a key part of the training range expires in 2029. Native Hawaiians upset with the U.S. military\u2019s history of damaging Hawaiian lands with target practice and fuel leaks want the Army out.",
      "\u201cThey have bombed and contaminated not just our land but our waters,\u201d said Healani Sonoda-Pale, a community organizer with the Hawaiian sovereignty group Ka Lahui Hawaii. \u201cWhen does this end?\u201d",
      "The military controls about 5% of Hawaii's land, including bases for all branches. It has programs and staff to protect endangered and threatened species, prevent fires, and plant native plants.",
      "But past incidents have made many Native Hawaiians skeptical.",
      "The Navy turned the island of Kahoolawe, off Maui, into a bombing range after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The Navy returned it in 1994 after years of protests. But subsequent cleanup efforts have been incomplete. Live grenades and bombs remain scattered across a quarter of the island.",
      "Memories are still fresh from when the Navy spilled jet fuel into Pearl Harbor\u2019s drinking water from a network of underground fuel storage tanks and pipes in 2021. The leak prompted 6,000 people to seek medical care for rashes, nausea and other ailments and contaminated a Honolulu aquifer. The disaster occurred after admirals spent years dismissing community calls to move the tanks. On Tuesday, Honolulu's water utility sued the Navy seeking to recoup an estimated $1.2 billion that it has had to spend because of the spill.",
      "Also on Oahu, environmental advocates say Army live-fire training in Makua Valley sparked wildfires and destroyed native forestland and sacred cultural sites. A legal settlement stopped such training in 2004.",
      "Pohakuloa consists of rocky plains, hills and brush about 6,200 feet (1,900 meters) above sea level between the Big Island\u2019s tallest volcanoes, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. It hosts endangered species including the Hawaiian catchfly shrub.",
      "Early Hawaiians ventured across the plateau to reach a Mauna Kea quarry that produced high-quality basalt for stone tools and to travel between coastal towns.",
      "In 2022, Army staff discovered ancient wooden \u201ckii,\u201d or figures, in a lava tube, an underground passageway created by molten rock. Consultants said the figures are from human burials, and state preservationists say they're among Hawaii's most significant archaeological finds.",
      "Pohakuloa Training Area spans more than 200 square miles (518 square kilometers). The section in question is only 17% of that total, but it\u2019s critically located in between two larger federal parcels. Troops fire munitions from the state-owned parcel onto federal lands.",
      "Other live-fire training areas in Hawaii are too small to accommodate battalions and brigades.",
      "Commanders say it would take too long to send troops, trucks and helicopters to the U.S. mainland for drills.",
      "\u201cWhat we anticipate in a future fight is that we will not have the time to recover that equipment and to position ourselves back into the region,\u201d said Maj. Gen. James Bartholomees, U.S. Army Pacific chief of staff.",
      "Pohakuloa training, he said, allows troops to \"move from Hawaii into the Indo-Pacific, into key terrain, to be prepared to meet our adversaries, or more importantly, to deter them.\u201d",
      "The Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force exercise there, as do allied and partner militaries. The Hawaii National Guard accounts for one-quarter of Pohakuloa's training. County fire and police departments use it too.",
      "The Army prepared an environmental impact statement, including public feedback, that analyzed how the military's continued use of the land would affect plants, animals and cultural heritage.",
      "On May 9, the state land board rejected it after hearing hours of often emotional testimony in opposition. Among other issues, the board cited inadequate inventory of unexploded ordnance and insufficient inventory of ancient burials and associated artifacts.",
      "The Army is considering whether to appeal. It could also negotiate a land exchange with the state instead.",
      "Such talks can't begin until the Army finalizes its environmental study with a decision about its plans. The defense secretary's office then must sign off on acquiring land.",
      "Alice Roberts, U.S. Army Pacific's program manager for training land retention, said the service has had some informal conversations, including trying to understand the state's swap criteria.",
      "Buying the land would be a \u201ca big hurdle,\u201d for the Army, she said, because two-thirds of the state House and Senate would need to approve such a transaction.",
      "U.S. Rep. Jill Tokuda, a Democrat, said the Army must double down on being good stewards and make up for the military's past mistakes.",
      "Tokuda wants the military to help increase Hawaii\u2019s housing supply, given that service members occupy 14% of Oahu\u2019s housing stock and that high housing costs are driving residents out. She said it could bolster Hawaii's water and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green suggested in an interview with Hawaii News Now that the military could take the land through eminent domain, but Tokuda said she hasn't heard anyone in the military or President Donald Trump's administration mention that.",
      "Kaiali\u02bbi Kahele, the chairperson of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, which advocates for Native Hawaiians, wants to see what federal lands the Army would offer. He wants to know whether it would be willing to reduce the impact of its training, and what sort of clean up and community benefits it would provide.",
      "\u201cWe have to get to a point where you do training and then you clean up your mess,\u201d said Kahele, a former congressman who served more than 20 years in the Hawaii Air National Guard and is now in the Air Force Reserve.",
      "\u201cThat should be the model of training that respects aina, respects this place and its culture and its people,\u201d he said, using the Hawaiian word for land.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists from the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium, and Tela Coral in Honduras are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef off Miami's coast",
      "KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -- A team of scientists from the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium and Tela Coral in Honduras is working together to transplant crossbred coral fragments onto a reef off Miami\u2019s coastline that was devastated by coral bleaching two years ago.",
      "They\u2019re looking for ways to help reefs survive increased ocean temperatures caused by global warming and climate change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very long process,\" Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School and director of the Coral Reef Futures Lab, said Tuesday as divers planted the corals off Miami.",
      "The plan of introducing corals from the Caribbean evolved over the past few years.",
      "\"We had this idea that we really needed to try to help Florida\u2019s coral reef by introducing more diversity from around the Caribbean, recognizing that some of the biggest threats to corals, like climate change, are really global phenomena and if you try to have Florida\u2019s reefs save themselves on their own, we could give them some outside help,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Coral breeding has also been done in Hawaii, where in 2021, scientists were working to speed up the coral\u2019s evolutionary clock to breed \u201csuper corals\u201d that can better withstand the impacts of global warming.",
      "Baker's group teamed with the Florida Aquarium and Tela Coral, bringing in fragments of corals from a warm reef off of Tela, Honduras, which spawned in tanks at the aquarium.",
      "\u201cWe were able to cross the spawn from those corals, the sperm and the eggs, to produce babies. One parent from Florida, one parent from Honduras,\u201d Baker said.",
      "They chose the reef off of Tela because the water is about 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the water off the coast of Florida.",
      "\u201cAnd yet the corals in those environments, and especially the Elkhorn corals, are really thriving,\u201d Baker said.",
      "He noted that there are extensive beds that are hundreds of meters long, full of flourishing Elkhorn.",
      "\u201cAnd yet they survive there despite really warm conditions and also quite nutrient-polluted waters,\u201d Baker said.",
      "The conditions are similar to those Florida will face over the next century, Baker said.",
      "It's also the first time international crossbreeding of corals has been permitted for planting onto wild reefs.",
      "\u201cSo we're really excited to see how these do,\u201d he said.",
      "The hope is the corals will be more \u201cthermally tolerant,\u201d which Baker and the team will be testing throughout the summer.",
      "Elkhorn corals are some of Florida's most iconic species and are valuable because they form the crest of the reef, Baker said.",
      "\u201cAnd the reef is what protects shorelines from storms and flooding. So if you have healthy Elkhorn coral populations, you have a great reef that is acting almost like a speed bump over which waves and storms pass and dissipate their energy before they hit the coast,\u201d he said.",
      "Elkhorn corals are in serious decline, thanks in part to the coral bleaching in 2023 and warming sea temperatures, Baker said.",
      "While coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them, prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds. The coral ejects them, and a stark white skeleton \u2014 referred to as coral bleaching \u2014 is left behind, and the weakened coral is at risk of dying.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost maybe more than 95% of the Elkhorn corals that were on Florida\u2019s reefs at that point,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Some of the corals spawned in the Florida Aquarium's laboratory arrived there in 2020, said Keri O\u2019Neil, director and senior scientist with the aquarium's Coral Conservation Program.",
      "She said more fragments from Honduras and Florida will continue to live at the center.",
      "\u201cWe hope that every year in the future we can make more and more crosses and continue to figure out which parents produce the best offspring,\u201d O'Neil said.",
      "The tiny Elkhorn coral fragments were placed onto small concrete bases along the reef on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve arranged them in a certain way that we can compare the performance of each of corals,\u201d Baker said.",
      "The team will study how the corals that have a Honduran parent compare to the ones that are entirely from Florida.",
      "\"But it\u2019s really the future that we\u2019re looking to and in particular, a warming future and a warming summer, how these corals do and do they have more thermal tolerance than the native Florida population, because that\u2019s really what the goal of the whole project is,'' he said.",
      "Baker said it's the most exciting project he's worked on during his 20-year stint at the University of Miami.",
      "If the corals thrive, it could provide a blueprint for working across the Caribbean to share corals.",
      "\u201cThis is a project about international collaboration, about the fact that our environment really doesn\u2019t have closed borders, that we can work together to make things better in the world,\u201d said Juli Berwald, co-founder of Tela Cora. \u201cAnd it shows that when we talk to each other, when we work together, we can really do something that might be life-changing, not just for us but for the corals and the reefs and all the animals that rely on the reefs.\u201d",

      "This seasonal dance choreographed by Mother Nature marks a special time for the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is when residents clasp their hands, hoping for much-needed moisture to dampen the threat of wildfire and keep rivers flowing.",
      "Forecasters say it has been a wet start to this year\u2019s monsoon season, which officially began June 15 and runs through the end of September. Parts of New Mexico and West Texas have been doused with rain, while Arizona and Nevada have been hit with dust storms, which are a common hazard of the season.",
      "In other parts of the world, monsoons often mean months of never-ending rain.",
      "In North America, the season can have considerable variability. The bursts and breaks depend on how much moisture is circulating and which way the wind blows.",
      "The monsoon relies on the buildup of summer heat and shifting wind direction, which helps funnel moisture from distant bodies of water to areas where rain is sparse.",
      "Just ahead of the monsoon, officials with the Navajo Nation declared an emergency because of worsening drought conditions across the reservation, which spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.",
      "Below-average precipitation month after month has left little forage for livestock, and fire danger has ramped up as pockets of moderate and severe drought expand. Ranchers and farmers are being urged to reduce their herds, shift to drought-tolerant crops and limit irrigation.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s governor also declared an emergency in May because of severe drought and escalating fire risk.",
      "Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Integrated Drought Information System say monsoonal rainfall only provides a fraction of the West\u2019s water supplies, with the majority coming from snowpack. Still, summer rains can reduce drought impacts by lessening the demand for water stored in reservoirs, recharging soil moisture and groundwater, and reducing the risk of wildfires.",
      "New Mexico and Arizona typically stand to benefit the most from the North American monsoon, getting anywhere between 10% to 60% of their annual precipitation during the season. It has a lesser influence in Nevada and California, though southern Nevada on average gets 20% to 25% of its precipitation during the summer.",
      "Along the Rio Grande at the base of the Jemez Mountains, Santa Ana Pueblo farmers are eagerly watching the afternoon skies. Pueblo Gov. Myron Armijo said they have already had several good downpours, and he wouldn\u2019t mind more.",
      "But that will be for the spirits to decide, Armijo said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not up to us,\u201d he said.",
      "With summer rains come increased river flows and in some cases flooding in normally dry washes and across the scars left by wildfires.",
      "Sandbag stations have been set up in communities across the region \u2014 from Tucson, Arizona, to Albuquerque and San Antonio, Texas. In Espa\u00f1ola, state transportation workers have closed a historic bridge that funnels traffic across the Rio Grande, citing concerns about higher flows further eroding a concrete pier.",
      "On the edge of the Gila National Forest, New Mexico National Guard troops have delivered dozens of pallets of filled sandbags for residents who are preparing for flooding following a blaze that has charred about 74 square miles (192 square kilometers).",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of firefighters are hoping for higher humidity and rain to tamp down a wildfire that is racing through a mountainous area of the Navajo Nation. Fire officials reported that the flames made a 6-mile (9.66-kilometer) run in a matter of hours.",
      "Once the fire is out, land managers acknowledge that the monsoon will be a mixed blessing, as rainfall on the charred hillsides will surely result in surges of runoff filled with ash and debris.",
      "Just as light and shadow move across the mesa tops beyond artist Daniel McCoy\u2019s studio, the Rio Grande pulses with each downpour, turning into what looks like a sudsy caramel concoction as it carries away sediment.",
      "The river and the desert badlands and purple mountain peaks that border it are the inspiration for the giant canvasses McCoy is preparing for an upcoming show at the Hecho a Mano gallery in Santa Fe.",
      "McCoy, who is Muskogee (Creek) and Potawatomi, grew up working on a farm with his grandfather in Oklahoma. He and his green thumb faced new challenges when he moved to the arid Southwest, where water shortages often lead to mandatory rationing and pleas for prayers.",
      "A sign down the street from his studio reads in Spanish: \u201cEl Agua No Se Vende. El Agua Se Defiende.\u201d It means water isn\u2019t for sale, and the right to access the finite resource should be defended.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s made me mindful more than I ever thought I would be,\u201d he said of hearing stories from longtime locals about the preciousness of water.",
      "But McCoy fits right in, living by the seasons and learning to tend to his drinking water well.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re outside working, it\u2019s a different kind of time. You live more by what the sun\u2019s doing and what the water\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s good to be connected to that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A volunteer searching the archives of the American Baptist in Massachusetts has found a nearly 180-year-old document shedding light on the church's support for ending slavery",
      "GROTON, Mass. -- Jennifer Cromack was combing through the American Baptist archive when she uncovered a slim box among some 18th and 19th century journals. Opening it, she found a scroll in pristine condition.",
      "A closer look revealed the 5-foot-long (1.5-meter-long) document was a handwritten declaration titled \u201cA Resolution and Protest Against Slavery,\" signed by 116 New England ministers in Boston and adopted March 2, 1847. Until its discovery in May at the archives in Groton, Massachusetts, American Baptist officials worried the anti-slavery document had been lost forever after fruitless searches at Harvard and Brown universities and other locations. A copy was last seen in a 1902 history book.",
      "\u201cI was just amazed and excited,\u201d Cromack, a retired teacher who volunteers at the archive, said. \u201cWe made a find that really says something to the people of the state and the people in the country. ... It speaks of their commitment to keeping people safe and out of situations that they should not be in.\"",
      "The document offers a glimpse into an emerging debate over slavery in the 18th century in the Northeast. The document was signed 14 years before the start of the Civil War as a growing number of religious leaders were starting to speak out against slavery.",
      "The document also shines a spotlight on a critical moment in the history of the Baptist church.",
      "It was signed two years after the issue of slavery prompted southern Baptists to split from northern Baptists and form the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. The split in 1845 followed a ruling by the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society prohibiting slave owners from becoming missionaries. The northern Baptists eventually became American Baptist Churches USA.",
      "\u201cIt comes from such a critical era in American history, you know, right prior to the Civil War,\u201d said Rev. Mary Day Hamel, the executive minister of the American Baptist Churches of Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cIt was a unique moment in history when Baptists in Massachusetts stepped up and took a strong position and stood for justice in the shaping of this country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s become part of our heritage to this day, to be people who stand for justice, for American Baptists to embrace diversity.\u201d",
      "Deborah Bingham Van Broekhoven, the executive director emerita of the American Baptist Historical Society, said many Americans at the time, especially in the North, were \u201cundecided\u201d about slavery and weren't sure how to respond or were worried about speaking out.",
      "\u201cThey thought it was a southern problem, and they had no business getting involved in what they saw as the state\u2019s rights,\u201d Van Broekhoven said. \u201cMost Baptists, prior to this, would have refrained from this kind of protest. This is a very good example of them going out on a limb and trying to be diplomatic.\u201d",
      "The document shows ministers had hoped \u201csome reformatory movement\u201d led by those involved in slavery would make their action \u201cunnecessary,\u201d but that they felt compelled to act after they \u201cwitnessed with painful surprise, a growing disposition to justify, extend and perpetuate their iniquitous system.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder these circumstances we can no longer be silent,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe owe something to the oppressed as well as to the oppressor, and justice demands the fulfillment of that obligation. Truth and Humanity and Public Virtue, have claims upon us which we cannot dishonor.\u201d",
      "The document explains why the ministers \u201cdisapprove and abhor the system of American slavery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith such a system we can have no sympathy,\u201d the document states. \u201cAfter a careful observation of its character and effects and making every deduction with the largest charity can require, we are constrained to regard it as an outrage upon the rights and happiness of our fellow men, for which there is no valid justification or apology.\u201d",
      "Rev. Diane Badger, the administrator of the American Baptist Church of Massachusetts who oversees the archive, teamed up with Rev. John Odams of the First Baptist Church in Boston to identify what she called the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of abolitionist-era Baptist documents. Her great-grandfather was an American Baptist minister.",
      "Since its discovery, Badger has put all the ministers' names on a spreadsheet along with the names of the churches where they served. Among them was Nathaniel Colver, of Tremont Temple in Boston, one of the first integrated churches in the country, now known as Tremont Temple Baptist Church. Another was Baron Stow, who belonged to the state's anti-slavery society.",
      "Badger also is working to estimate the value of the document, which is intact with no stains or damage, and is making plans to ensure it is protected. A digital copy could eventually be shared with some of Massachusetts' 230 American Baptist churches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of an interesting journey and it\u2019s one that\u2019s still unfolding,\u201d Badger said. \u201cThe questions that always come to me, OK, I know who signed it but who didn\u2019t? I can go through my list, through my database and find who was working where on that and why didn\u2019t they sign that. So it\u2019s been very interesting to do the research.\u201d",
      "Rev. Kenneth Young \u2014 whose predominantly Black Calvary Baptist Church in Haverhill, Massachusetts, was created by freed Blacks in 1871 \u2014 called the discovery inspiring.",
      "\u201cI thought it was awesome that we had over hundred signers to this, that they would project that freedom for our people is just,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt follows through on the line of the abolitionist movement and fighting for those who may not have had the strength to fight for themselves against a system of racism.\u201d",

      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

      "The man accused of killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due back in court after a week's delay",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- The man charged with killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due back in federal court Thursday for a hearing that was put on hold after his lawyer said his client had been unable to sleep while on suicide watch.",
      "The hearing is expected to address whether Vance Boelter should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed with the case. He's not expected to enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first, before his arraignment, which is when a plea is normally entered.",
      "An unshaven Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, was wearing a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers when he was brought into court last Friday. Federal defender Manny Atwal then asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing. She said Boelter had been sleep deprived due to harsh conditions in the Sherburne County Jail, making it difficult for them to communicate.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I haven\u2019t really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\u201d Boelter told the judge then. And he denied being suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.\u201d",
      "Sherburne County Sheriff Joel Brott, whose jail houses both county and federal prisoners, rejected Boelter's claims of poor conditions as absurd. \u201cHe is not in a hotel. He\u2019s in jail, where a person belongs when they commit the heinous crimes he is accused of committing,\" Brott said in a statement Friday.",
      "Boelter faces separate cases in federal and state court on charges of murder and attempted murder for what the state's chief federal prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination\u201d and \u201ca chilling attack on our democracy.\u201d The feds are going first.",
      "Authorities say Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot to death in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park in the early hours of June 14 by a man disguised as a police officer who was driving a fake squad car.",
      "Boelter also allegedly shot and seriously wounded state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, earlier that morning at their home in nearby Champlin. The Hoffmans are recovering, but Hortman's golden retriever, Gilbert, was seriously injured and had to be euthanized.",
      "Boelter surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history, a hunt of around 40 hours.",
      "Atwal told the court last week that Boelter had been kept in what\u2019s known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his first court appearance June 16. She said the lights were on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slammed frequently, the inmate in the next cell would spread feces on the walls, and the smell would drift to Boelter\u2019s cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity, and let him communicate better. The judge granted the delay.",
      "Boelter\u2019s lawyers have declined to comment on the charges themselves, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson has said no decision has been made whether to seek it. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. But Attorney General Pam Bondi has said from the start that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in seeking capital punishment.",
      "Prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. They also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",
      "Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the mourners at the Hortmans' funeral last Saturday. Gov. Tim Walz, Harris's running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, eulogized Hortman as \u201cthe most consequential speaker in Minnesota history.\u201d",
      "Hortman served as speaker from 2019 until January. She then yielded the post to a Republican in a power-sharing deal after the House became tied in the 2024 elections, and became speaker emerita.",

      "BOSTON -- In the state that served as the model for Obamacare, advocates and health care workers fear the Trump administration is trying to dismantle piece-by-piece a popular program that has provided insurance, preventive care and life-saving medication to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "Provisions contained in both the Senate and House versions of the massive tax and spending cuts bill advancing in Congress \u2014 a centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 could strip health insurance from up to a quarter of the roughly 400,000 people enrolled in the Massachusetts Health Connector, according to state estimates.",
      "The changes would create anew the coverage gaps state leaders were working to close when Massachusetts in 2006 became the first U.S. state to enact a law requiring nearly every resident to have health insurance, state officials say. Beyond the effect on residents' health, losing care could have broader repercussions \u2014 both for the program's finances and residents' ability to make a living.",
      "\u201cThe idea of needing to unwind that now and pull back on that promise and commitment is really frustrating and heartbreaking and cruel and counterproductive,\u201d said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of Massachusetts\u2019 health insurance marketplace.",
      "Trump and Republican supporters in Congress say the changes, which include new documentation requirements and limitations on who can apply for tax credits to help pay for insurance, are necessary to root out what they call fraud, waste and abuse. The Affordable Care Act changes proposed in both versions of the bill, along with massive cuts to Medicaid and other programs, would eliminate roughly $1.1 trillion in health care spending over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In Lawrence, a mill community of around 90,000 people on the Merrimack River, where more than 80% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, Kesia Moreta said she's already seeing people slip out of the state's health care network because of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "Moreta, who manages a program created under the ACA that helps people sign up for coverage, said clients have been missing meetings out of fear that being enrolled for health insurance will harm their effort to stay in the U.S. legally.",
      "Recently, a father of a U.S.-born teenage son with epilepsy deleted every email related to his health plan and stopped answering calls from the Connector after watching reports about deportations on social media. When his son\u2019s medication ran out, Moreta said the father finally reached out, whispering over the phone, \u201cIs this going to get me deported?\u201d",
      "\u201cThat breaks our hearts,\u201d Moreta said.",
      "More than 98% of Massachusetts residents have health insurance, the lowest rate of uninsurance in the country, according to the Massachusetts Health Insurance Survey.",
      "Vicky Pulos, an attorney for the Mass Law Reform Institute who helps low-income people gain access to health care, said Republicans who tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act during the first Trump administration have decided to take it apart incrementally despite its growing popularity.",
      "\u201cIt really seems like this is just a less transparent way of effectively dismantling the accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act in both Medicaid and the marketplace,\u201d Pulos said.",
      "The changes, she added, \u201cwill massively drive up the number of uninsured but without openly repealing the ACA.\u201d",
      "Another provision included in both the House and Senate bills would require people applying for or renewing coverage to provide more documentation of their income, household size and immigration status to be eligible for premium tax credits when the state marketplace already has that information, which Morse Gasteier said would cause \u201cfriction, red tape and delays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said the proposals will \u201cput a stop\u201d to immigrants \u201cstealing taxpayer-funded health care benefits meant for American citizens.\u201d",
      "No states use federal money to provide health insurance to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Some, like Massachusetts, use state tax dollars to do so to provide basic primary care services for a small population of vulnerable residents, like children.",
      "No undocumented immigrants receive insurance through the state marketplace.",
      "Of the 400,000 enrolled in the state marketplace, around 60,000 are noncitizens who are in the U.S. legally and would lose access to federal premium tax credits if either chamber's version of the bill becomes law. The number includes domestic violence and human trafficking victims, refugees, people granted asylum or humanitarian parole, temporary protected status and other work-authorized immigrants.",
      "Without the credits, premiums will cost upwards of $500 or $600 \u2014 an increase many people can't afford, Morse Gasteier said. Around half are green-card holders with an annual income of $15,000 a year or less.",
      "The remaining 40,000 people expected to lose coverage are U.S. citizens Morse Gasteier said could be stymied in applying or recertifying coverage by provisions like the increased documentation requirements.",
      "Morse Gasteier said Massachusetts' marketplace worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to enroll vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations after the state program \u2014 formed under the leadership of then-Gov. Mitt Romney and known as \u201cRomneycare\" \u2014 was created.",
      "She worries that if people hear help is no longer available, \u201centire populations will just sort of give up on health insurance.\u201d",
      "In addition to affecting residents' health, that could have an economic impact in the state.",
      "Immigrants with legal status enrolled in the state marketplace tend to be younger than the rest of the population, Morse Gasteier said. Their presence brings premiums down for others because they tend to be healthier.",
      "In Lawrence, advocates who help people obtain insurance coverage though the ACA marketplace say the burden would fall disproportionately on people with chronic health issues like diabetes and chronic heart disease.",
      "The Greater Lawrence Community Action Council assists around 10,000 people a year with either signing up for or renewing health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not healthy, let me tell you, you can\u2019t work. If you can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t pay your bills. It\u2019s just as simple as that,\u201d said GLCAC CEO Vilma Martinez-Dominguez.",
      "Moreta said one man who called her from the emergency room recently said he discovered his health insurance had lapsed. Moreta said she could help him renew it, and urged him to wait at the hospital.",
      "He told her not to do anything. He was leaving the hospital. She has no idea what became of him.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",

      "A veteran who died in Chicago without any recollection of their life has been memorialized in a funeral service with military honors",
      "CHICAGO -- Standing near the gravestone for the relative he never met, Mark Bailey accepted the crisply folded American flag from the Army officer, hugged it to his chest and closed his eyes.",
      "Though the person he called his aunt \u2014 born Reba Caroline Bailey \u2014 had been estranged, missing for decades and died in 2015 as an unidentified ward of the state, he felt connection and a sense of closure.",
      "\u201cI want to let Reba know we\u2019re part of the circle and part of the family,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark Bailey was among dozens of attendees at an unusual funeral service with military honors this week for an Illinois veteran with memory problems so severe that they died an unnamed person. The ceremony became possible because of an extraordinary cold case investigation that identified the 75-year-old postmortem.",
      "Investigators unearthed the mystery of how the Women\u2019s Army Corps veteran ended up homeless in Chicago with few recollections of their own life, aside from identifying as a man named Seven.",
      "\u201cI never knew I had this family member,\u201d said Mark Bailey\u2019s 19-year-old son Cole, who also drove from central Illinois for the service. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I have somebody that\u2019s been found and isn\u2019t lost anymore.\u201d",
      "Since the investigation\u2019s conclusion, the numbered cement cylinder that marked the unidentified grave has been replaced with a rectangular plague with a cross that reads: \u201cReba Caroline Bailey, PFC US Army.\u201d",
      "The case of Seven Doe, the name appearing in some official records, came to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart\u2019s office in 2023. The unidentified body belonged to a person who died of natural causes in an assisted living facility. They were a ward of the state, unable to remember a legal name or family.",
      "The cause of death was heart disease with diabetes and dementia as contributing factors and the body was buried in a section for unclaimed people at Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery on Chicago's Far South Side. The medical examiner marked it as the 4,985th case of the year and put the number on the headstone.",
      "In 2023, investigators ran fingerprints taken postmortem and found a 1961 Army record for the veteran, formerly of Danville, about 140 miles (225.31 kilometers) south of Chicago. The search for close living relatives came up short; five siblings and an ex-husband had all died.",
      "The family members they did locate had only heard stories of a relative who had disappeared. After making the identification, detectives ordered a new headstone with the same name on military records. It was quietly installed last year.",
      "Commander Jason Moran, who oversees the sheriff\u2019s missing persons unit, said it was rewarding to make sure the identified veteran got the benefit of a funeral with military honors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a privilege to be able to help families and really close the story,\u201d said Moran, whose work on other high-profile cold cases has gained notoriety.",
      "Several generations of the Bailey family have told stories about what happened to their missing relative since leaving the military to get married.",
      "They've wondered about the possibility of children or their relative's gender identity. Some believe that there was a family dispute but the stories about its origins vary from the decision to join the military to sexual orientation.",
      "Family members tried to find their missing relative over the years, including Amanda Ingram, who would have been a great-niece. She maintains a meticulous family tree with Census records and photos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how somebody can just disappear like that and not know what happened,\u201d Ingram said this week. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re never going to know the details.\u201d",
      "On a winter day in the late 1970s, a person wearing a military-style jacket and aviator cap was curled up on the porch of St. Francis Catholic Worker House in Chicago. Residents who stayed there at the time told the Associated Press that the person asked to be called Seven, spoke in the third person and identified as a man.",
      "Seven quickly became the house cook. The meals drew crowds to the neighborhood where several homeless advocacy groups operated, according to former residents' accounts.",
      "Investigators have tried to explain the memory loss and floated theories about brain damage related to a 1950 car accident that killed Bailey's mother or to military service. That included stints at Fort Ord in California, a polluted former Army base, and Fort McClellan in Alabama, formerly used for chemical weapons training, and where the federal government has acknowledged potential exposure to toxins.",
      "Neither family, investigators nor residents of the worker house figured out the meaning behind the name Seven.",
      "Ingram, who lives in Alabama, couldn\u2019t make the ceremony this week. But she asked volunteers from an Illinois chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution to attend on her behalf.",
      "\u201cEverybody who comes to visit that cemetery will pass by it and know who she was,\u201d said Ingram, whose detailed family trees include records using Bailey's birth name.",
      "Mark Bailey said he and his son wanted to bring something to the service that would honor both parts of their long-lost relative's life.",
      "They had heard their relative had an affinity for the Cubs and looked for a jersey with the number \u201c7\u201d on it, but settled on a blue team cap. They set it on the headstone.",
      "The service held Tuesday included prayers, a 21-gun salute and a bugler playing taps \u2014 a chilling, 24-note salute that is traditionally played at funerals of U.S. military veterans. Attendees included Cook County sheriff's investigators and Archdiocese of Chicago staff.",
      "\u201cI just wish the rest of them could be identified as well,\u201d Mark Bailey told those attending while pointing to the rows of unidentified graves.",
      "Dart, the Cook County sheriff, said the ceremony left him nearly speechless, saying the Illinois veteran deserved military honors and a flag from the U.S. president \u201cinstead of being forgotten and left as an anonymous number somewhere.\u201d",
      "Relatives said they planned to eventually display the flag at the American Legion in Potomac, near where the Bailey family has roots.",
      "Mark Bailey said the acknowledgement of military service was particularly meaningful with so many veterans in the extended family. He hoped the memory would stay with his son Cole, who plans to enlist.",
      "\u201cFor him, it\u2019ll be something he\u2019ll have forever,\u201d he said.",

      "OCHOPEE, Fla. -- The first group of immigrants were scheduled to arrive Wednesday night at a new detention center deep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the state's attorney general said.",
      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,\" Florida Republican Attorney General James Uthmeier said on the X social media platform. \"Next stop: back to where they came from.\u201d",
      "The facility, at an airport used for training, will have a capacity of about 3,000 detainees when fully operational, according to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The center was built in eight days over 10 miles (16 kilometers) of Everglades. It features more than 200 security cameras, 28,000-plus feet (8,500 meters) of barbed wire and 400 security personnel.",
      "Environmental groups and Native American tribes have protested against the center, contending it is a threat to the fragile Everglades system, would be cruel to detainees because of heat and mosquitoes, and is on land the tribes consider sacred.",
      "DeSantis and other state officials say locating the facility in the rugged and remote Florida Everglades is meant as a deterrent, and naming it after the notorious federal prison of Alcatraz, an island fortress known for its brutal conditions, is meant to send a message. It\u2019s another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying on scare tactics to try to persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.",
      "State and federal officials have touted the plans on social media and conservative airwaves, sharing a meme of a compound ringed with barbed wire and \u201cguarded\u201d by alligators wearing hats labeled \u201cICE\u201d for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Republican Party of Florida has taken to fundraising off the detention center, selling branded T-shirts and beer koozies emblazoned with the facility\u2019s name.",

      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants earmarked for immigrants\u2019 children and low-income students to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "Senior U.N. officials warn that Haiti\u2019s gangs have gained \u201cnear-total control\u201d of the capital and authorities are unable to stop escalating violence across the impoverished Caribbean nation",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Haiti\u2019s gangs have gained \u201cnear-total control\u201d of the capital and authorities are unable to stop escalating violence across the impoverished Caribbean nation, senior U.N. officials warned Wednesday.",
      "An estimated 90% of the capital Port-au-Prince is now under control of criminal groups who are expanding attacks not only into surrounding areas but beyond into previously peaceful areas, Ghada Fathy Waly, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\u201cSouthern Haiti, which until recently was insulated from the violence, has seen a sharp increase in gang-related incidents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the east, criminal groups are exploiting land routes, including key crossings like Belladere and Malpasse, where attacks against police and customs officials have been reported.\u201d",
      "Waly said the state\u2019s authority to govern is rapidly shrinking as gang control expands with cascading effects. Criminal groups are stepping into the vacuum left by the absence or limited delivery of public services and are establishing \u201cparallel governance structures,\u201d and gang control of major trade routes has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for cooking fuel and rice, Haiti\u2019s staple food, she said.",
      "U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca told the council \u201cthe ongoing gang encirclement of Port-au-Prince\u201d and their strengthened foothold in the capital and beyond is \u201cpushing the situation closer to the brink.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout increased action by the international community, the total collapse of state presence in the capital could become a very real scenario,\u201d he warned.",
      "Gangs have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July 2021 and previously were estimated to control 85% of the capital. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination.",
      "A  U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 proposal in February to have the U.N. provide drones, fuel, ground and air transport and other non-lethal support to the Kenya-led mission has languished in the council.",
      "In response to the gangs, the UNODC\u2019s Waly said there has been a rapid growth in the number and activities of private security companies and vigilante self-defense groups, with some trying to protect their communities while others act illegally and collude with gangs.",
      "\u201cOver the last three months,\" Jenca said, \"these groups reportedly killed at least 100 men and one woman suspected of gang association or collaboration.\u201d",
      "He said the last three months have also seen an increase in sexual violence by gangs with the U.N. political mission in Haiti documenting 364 incidents of sexual violence involving 378 survivors just from March to April.",
      "A new report by U.N. experts covering the period from last October through February said the gangs have exploited political turmoil and the disorganized response to Haiti\u2019s security crisis, pointing to competing political ambitions and allegations of corruption within Haiti\u2019s transitional governing bodies that have stymied action.",
      "\u201cWhile the expansion of territorial control brings gangs additional sources of revenue and bargaining power,\u201d the experts said, \u201cthese attacks are also backed by individuals trying to destabilize the political transition for their own political goals.\u201d",
      "One major result is that very little progress has been made toward restoring public security or implementing the roadmap for organizing national elections by February 2026, the experts monitoring an arms embargo on Haiti and sanctions against key gang leaders said in the report to the Security Council.",
      "With a weak national police force facing acute tensions in its leadership, an army that needs rebuilding, and the limited ability of the multinational force, the experts warned that the gangs will continue \u201cto have the upper hand unless stronger international support is provided.\u201d",
      "As for vigilante groups, the experts said, they \u201coften include local police officers, some of whom actively participate in human rights violations.\u201d",
      "The Haitian National Police have also carried out \u201ca worrying number of extrajudicial killings \u2026 with suspected gang members often summarily executed,\u201d the experts said, pointing to 281 summary executions by specialized police units in 2024 including 22 women and 8 children.",
      "Despite the U.N. arms embargo on Haiti, gangs continue to obtain more powerful weapons not only from regional civilian markets but from police stockpiles in Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic, the experts said.",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has vetoed a bill that would repeal an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate for power generation",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein vetoed legislation Wednesday that in part would repeal an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set for power generation in a 2021 law, arguing that the bill would have discouraged diverse energy sources and harmed consumers.",
      "The measure, which largely addresses activities involving Duke Energy \u2014 the state's dominant electric utility \u2014 would get rid of the current requirement that electric regulators take \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030.",
      "A directive in the 2021 law to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 stays in place with or without the legislation.",
      "Environmental critics who want cleaner energy sources to come online sooner urged Stein to veto the bill. They also were unhappy with other bill provisions that they argue will make Duke Energy more profitable and shift costs of producing or purchasing electricity to residential customers.",
      "The bill \u201cwalks back our state\u2019s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,\u201d Stein said in a news release. \u201cMy job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy. This bill fails that test.\u201d",
      "Stein, a former attorney general who took office in January, also vetoed two more bills Wednesday from dozens still on his desk left by the GOP-controlled legislature.",
      "These and four other recent Stein vetoes are subject to potential override votes, perhaps coming as soon as later this month. Speaking Wednesday only on the energy bill, House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger expressed confidence in successful overrides. Over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voted for the measure in June.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law was the result of a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "Now GOP supporters of the current bill say the 70% reduction mandate is unnecessary and will needlessly raise customer rates by requiring outsize growth for renewable sources like solar and wind power. The state Utilities Commission already pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years.",
      "By focusing on meeting the 2050 carbon-neutrality mandate, bill supporters say, regulators can direct Duke Energy, which backed the measure, to assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases.",
      "They cite an analysis performed by a state agency that represents utility customers that calculated the repeal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend on energy sources for the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents, which include several environmental groups, question the savings figure. And Stein cited another study in saying the bill could cost utility customers more through 2050 due to higher fuel costs.",
      "\u201cWe need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets,\u201d Stein added.",
      "At least 17 other states, most of them controlled by Democrats, have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "Environmentalists praised Stein's action and urged lawmakers to uphold the veto. \u201cStand instead for affordable energy and economic opportunity for all,\u201d said Dan Crawford of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters.",
      "Donald Bryson of the conservative-leaning John Locke Foundation urged an override, saying Stein \u201chas chosen ideology over affordability.\u201d",
      "Another vetoed measure Wednesday attempted to clarify and adjust powers of the state auditor \u2014 currently Republican Dave Boliek \u2014 including his ability to investigate alleged improper governmental activities of individuals, nonprofits and other groups that receive government funds.",
      "Stein's veto message said the auditor's \u201csweeping access\u201d in the bill to records of \u201cany private corporation that accepts any amount of state funding\u201d could undermine business recruitment efforts.",
      "Boliek said in a statement that Stein's veto \u201cundercuts the important principles of accountability and transparency that taxpayers expect from their government.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A military veteran has been sentenced to life in prison for plotting to attack an FBI office and assassinate law enforcement officers",
      "WASHINGTON -- A military veteran was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for plotting to attack an FBI office and assassinate law enforcement officers in retaliation for his arrest on charges that he was part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, court records show.",
      "Edward Kelley was one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol. Nearly two years later, Kelley made plans with another man to attack the FBI office in Knoxville, Tennessee, using improvised explosive devices attached to vehicles and drones, according to prosecutors.",
      "Last November, a jury convicted Kelley of conspiring to murder federal employees, solicitation to commit a crime of violence and influencing federal officials by threat.",
      "Kelley, 36, received a pardon from President Donald Trump for his Jan. 6 convictions, but a judge agreed with prosecutors that Trump's action did not extend to Kelley's Tennessee case. That makes Kelley, who is from Maryvale, Tennessee, one of only a few Capitol riot defendants remaining in prison after the Republican president's sweeping act of clemency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Thomas Varlan handed down Kelley's life sentence during a hearing in Knoxville, according to court records. The judge denied a request for Kelley to be released pending the outcome of an appeal.",
      "Prosecutors had recommended a life sentence for Kelley, saying he was remorseless and incapable of rehabilitation.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Kelley served in the Marine Corps for eight years. He was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan before his 2015 discharge from the military.",
      "On Jan. 6, 2021, Kelley was captured on video helping two other rioters throw a Capitol Police officer onto the ground and using a piece of wood to damage a window, according to the FBI. He was the fourth person to enter the Capitol through a broken window, the FBI said.",
      "After a trial without a jury, a federal judge in Washington convicted Kelley last November of 11 counts stemming from the riot. Before Kelley could be sentenced, Trump pardoned him and hundreds of other convicted Capitol rioters.",
      "Kelley argued that his pardon was broad enough to cover his conduct in the Tennessee case, but the judge disagreed. Varlan said Kelley's crimes in the Tennessee case were separated from Kelley's conduct on Jan. 6 \u201cby years and miles.\u201d Prosecutors reached the same conclusion.",
      "In other Jan. 6 cases, however, Trump's Justice Department has argued that the pardons apply to separate convictions. For instance, prosecutors concluded that a Kentucky man's pardon for storming the Capitol also covered his conviction for illegally possessing guns when FBI agents searched his home for the Jan. 6 investigation.",
      "Kelley has been jailed since December 2022. His lawyer, Mark Brown, said Kelley did not hurt anybody or directly threaten anybody with violence. Brown urged the judge to reject prosecutors' request to apply a \u201cterrorism enhancement\u201d in calculating his client's sentence.",
      "\u201cKelley does not deserve the same sentence as an actual \u2018terrorist\u2019 who injured or killed hundreds or thousands of America citizens,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Kelley's co-defendant, Austin Carter, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in January 2024. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 4.",
      "Kelley created a list of 36 law-enforcement officers to target for assassination and shared it with Carter, calling it their first \u201cmission,\u201d according to prosecutors. All the officers were involved in Kelley's May 2022 arrest on Capitol riot charges and the FBI's search of his home.",
      "\u201cThe proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Kelley, Carter and a third man used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss plans, prosecutors said. Carter testified that he met with Kelley to conduct military-style training in November 2022.",
      "\u201cCarter\u2019s testimony was unequivocal \u2014 he had no doubts that, had he and Kelley not been arrested, the law enforcement personnel included on Kelley\u2019s list would have been murdered,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Kelley's attorney said the case involved \u201clittle to no planning.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscussions did not lead to action,\" Brown wrote. \"And while people may not like what Mr. Kelley had to say, he stands behind his position that he has a First Amendment right to free speech.\u201d",

      "\"I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of old friend Mike Madsen,\" Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney said in a statement. \"Although I knew him years ago, it was very memorable, as he acted in a production of 'Of Mice and Men' which I directed. Michael was a car mechanic when we started rehearsals. He wrote long handwritten letters to me for years about how art saved his life. He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",
      "He is perhaps best known for his role as Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the iconic scene in which he tortures a police officer while the 1973 Stealers Wheel hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background.",
      "While usually not playing the lead role, his unmistakable gruff voice made him a memorable presence in smaller roles and even bit parts in films like \"Sin City,\" \"Donnie Brasco\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"",
      "Madsen has also published several collections of poetry, including \"Burning in Paradise\" and \"Expecting Rain.\"",
      "\"His work reflects the same gritty realism and emotional undercurrent that defines his acting,\" his representatives said in a statement. \"In addition to acting and writing, he is an accomplished photographer and has produced a number of independent projects.\"",

      "Madsen also referenced \"mistakes\" he had made in his life during that speech, which was mainly addressed to his wife, DeAnna Morgan.

He was sentenced to four days in jail and five years probation, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",

      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",

      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will remain detained after a jury found him guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his high-profile trial in New York City. The music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he denied bail for Combs because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs was convicted of two counts of prostitution-related charges. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.",
      "Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said Wednesday, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "After leaving court, Combs' attorney declined to comment on the bail denial, saying \"a lot of these things are still in process.\"",
      "\"We are not nearly done fighting,\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters outside U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan. \"Today was a major, major step in the right direction, but we fight on and we're gonna win, and we're not gonna stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.\"",
      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend \"Jane,\" the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he has been held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and that \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",
      "The attorneys cited conditions under the Bail Reform Act that states \"a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense is entitled to release pending sentencing if the Court finds by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he 'is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.'\"",
      "Federal prosecutors, however, argued that the Bail Reform Act dictates that Combs should remain in custody.",
      "In their filing to the judge, prosecutors said the crimes Combs was convicted of \"constitute crimes of violence and mandate detention following the defendant's conviction.\"",
      "\"As detention is mandatory following a conviction of a Mann Act offense, the Government has been unable to locate a case in which a defendant was released from custody following such a conviction,\" prosecutors said.",

When the jury foreperson, that's juror number five, was the one who was reading the verdict, he pumped his fist,\" CBS News New York's Alice Gainer said. \"After the verdict was read and once everyone, the judge and the jury, left the courtroom, man, the applause was thunderous from his family.\"",
      "Combs' three daughters, his sons, his mother, other family and friends, and supporters were in the courtroom Wednesday.",
      "\"They were just cheering. He was clapping. And it's such an interesting visual, because, again, he's by the defense table. It's not like he can run up and hug them. He's not a free man. He was convicted of two of the five counts,\" Gainer said.",

They had to set up multiple overflow rooms at one point just to make sure they could meet the demand. Because not everyone could get into the main courtroom, so they have these overflow rooms set up with a feed of what's going on in the main courtroom that people can then watch themselves,\" Gainer added.",

The foreman told Judge Arun Subramanian that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because they had jurors \"with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\" The judge told them to keep deliberating, and the jurors were later dismissed for the day.",
      "According to the jury's verdict sheet, there are eight acts under the federal racketeering conspiracy charge: kidnapping, arson, bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, sex trafficking, transportation and inducement to travel for purposes of prostitution, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

      "London \u2014 The BBC has said it regrets not pulling down its live stream of a performance at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend that included what the broadcaster calls \"utterly unacceptable\" chants against Israel's military.",
      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit alleging negligence in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie \"Rust,\" according to court documents released Friday.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by three \"Rust\" crew members seeking compensation for emotional distress from producers of \"Rust,\" including Alec Baldwin as co-producer and lead actor.",
      "The civil suit accused producers of failing to follow industry safety rules \u2014 allegations they denied.",
      "Terms of the settlement were not available. Attorneys for \"Rust\" producers and the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached by phone or email.",
      "Plaintiffs to the lawsuit included Ross Addiego, a front-line crew member who witnessed at close range the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on October 2021 on a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.",
      "A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Separately, \"Rust\" armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March 2024. Prosecutors accused Gutierrez-Reed of unwittingly bringing live ammunition on set and failing to follow basic gun safety protocols. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison. She was released in May 2025, 13 months into her sentence, after being granted parole. Her parole will run through May 2026.",
      "Baldwin was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has called the tragedy a \"one-in-a-trillion event.\"",
      "Addiego testified at Gutierrez-Reed's trial and appeared before the grand jury that indicted Baldwin.",
      "The filming of \"Rust\" was completed in Montana in 2023. Baldwin said finishing the film was \"nothing less than a miracle.\" The Western was released in theaters in May.",

      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",
      "\"I'm a person that's a fixer. I fix things. This situation I had to sit back and put the faith in my doctors and my wife,\" he explained. \"Once you get out of your own way and realize it's not about you, it's about your family, the process becomes easier.\"",
      "Parchman said there's an importance of open communication between partners during fertility treatments. He and his wife created what he called a \"safe space\" where they could express their feelings without judgment.",
      "The book also addresses how to handle well-meaning but often misguided advice from friends and family. Parchman advised giving people grace while recognizing that their suggestions may not be helpful.",
      "\"I had friends tell me, 'Eat three eggs and spin around and jump,'\" he said. \"Thanks for the advice, but I'm listening to the doctors.\"",
      "Beyond becoming a father, Parchman said the IVF journey transformed his understanding of masculinity. He now advocates for men to be more vulnerable and open about their struggles.",
      "\"It's being vulnerable, creating a space to express how you feel with your partner or friends,\" he said. \"I want to speak out and tell men it's okay to speak out about your feelings and thoughts because we all have them.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",

    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.",
      "Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.",
      "According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.",
      "Pricier EVs",
      "Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.",
      "\"That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,\" Malmgren said.",
      "The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.",
      "That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.",
      "\"Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,\" Malmgren said.",
      "Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.",

      "A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas.",
      "Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.",
      "Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long-term is still less polluting than a gas car.",
      "Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) \u2014 slightly more than the average American drives in a year \u2014 the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation.",
      "Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Cleaner machine",
      "So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.",
      "\"They are a no-brainer,\" Slowik said. \"Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.\"",
      "A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.",
      "Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.",
      "\"If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that's already four to five times more efficient,\" Slowik said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration faces pressure to clinch more trade deals, with a temporary tariff freeze on dozens of countries set to expire.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he does not plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas.

      "Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump said the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",

      "Lululemon is suing Costco, accusing the discount retailer of selling \"confusingly similar\" replicas of its jackets, sweatshirts and pants.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Indeed, one of the purposes of selling 'dupes' is to confuse consumers at the point-of-sale and/or observers post-sale into believing that the 'dupes' are Plaintiffs' authentic products when they are not,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Lululemon refers to itself in the lawsuit as a \"path-breaking\" apparel company that has set a new standard for performance athletic wear, adding that its \"construction techniques\" and \"strategic fits\" help it stand out to consumers. Reached for comment, the Vancouver, Canada-based company said it fiercely defends its products.",
      "\"As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary,\" a Lululemon company spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Small businesses facing higher import costs because of steeper U.S. tariffs are having to find different ways of handling the added expense.",
      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",
      "\"We can't find a source outside of China for our potentiometer, which is critical for our designs,\" Keeley said. \"Even when we call companies in Taiwan, they say they get theirs from China.\"",
      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

      "CBS News' parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and the plaintiffs' fees and costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.",
      "The settlement did not include an apology.",
      "Paramount also agreed that \"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawsuit, filed last October when he was still a candidate for president, was widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment. He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",
      "Weeks later, Wendy McMahon, who served as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, announced she was also departing. \"It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on a path forward,\" she wrote in a note to staffers.",

Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, explained, \"That statute is about sales \u2014 a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"",
      "Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Noah Feldman called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"",
      "Politicians had also spoken out about the suit, urging Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone not to settle. The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",
      "The FCC's approval is necessary for Paramount's $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media to move ahead, and the agency didn't make a decision on the transaction by the informal 180-day deadline to review mergers, which passed in May. Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",
      "If completed, the Paramount-Skydance merger will cap off a long, turbulent sales process that attracted multiple potential bidders.

    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",

    "summary": "New study\u200b ranks the best job markets in the U.S. based on commute times, access to employer health insurance and other factors.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to finding a job, where you look can be just as important as who you know.",
      "A new analysis by SmartAsset sought to identify the best job markets around the U.S. by ranking 348 cities based on six metrics: unemployment rate; rate of income growth; percentage of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance; typical commute time; percentage of remote workers; and median housing payments as a share of income.",
      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",
      "When it comes to cities with the highest percentage of remote workers, Frisco, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro, stands out from the crowd, with over 32% of workers conducting their jobs remotely. Berkeley, California, and Charlotte, North Carolina, also embrace work from home with a total 29% and 28% remote workers, respectively.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 13:53:32 -0400",
    "summary": "GOP tax and spending bill would create a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. But not all would lower taxes for workers in tipped jobs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips could soon come to fruition after the Senate passed President Trump's massive budget package.",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "Senators narrowly approved the legislation, which Republicans call the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" on July 1 by a vote of 51-50. The measure now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the bill and urged lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:11:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "Additionally, cost increases for parts and other intermediate inputs could take time to work their way through supply chains before they show up in consumer prices.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",

Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\"",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock - the names of the previous teams - would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn't get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates.

    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This tax provision was removed from the final version of the Senate bill that\u00a0passed on Tuesday, July 1. Read more here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

      "The idea came up during a Thursday night speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, one year and one day before the 250th anniversary of the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence. The federal government is planning to mark the occasion with a year's worth of events \u2014 including a UFC fight, according to Mr. Trump.",

      "Further details on the event, which is not lacking for possible names (the Rose Garden Fight Night? Oval Office Octagon?), are unclear. But the president is \"dead serious\" about the idea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a pool reporter on Thursday. A UFC spokesperson also confirmed the plans to CBS News.",

    "summary": "In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge would generate more than $90 million annually.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday calling on the national park system to charge higher entry fees for foreign visitors.",
      "It instructs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 who oversees the National Park Service \u2014 to \"develop a strategy\" to hike entrance fees and recreation pass fees for non-U.S. residents at any national park that currently charges for entry.",
      "\"To fund improvements and enhanced experiences across the park system, I've just signed an executive order to raise entrance fees for foreign tourists while keeping prices low for Americans,\" Mr. Trump said in a Thursday evening rally in Iowa. \"The national parks will be about America first.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Interior Department and the National Park Service regarding when the fee hike may take effect or how much the surcharge for nonresidents could cost.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "Not all national parks charge an entrance fee, and for those that do, the fee varies. Generally, visitors can purchase either a standard daily or weekly pass to one specific park, or an annual pass that can be used at one park or in a certain region of the country. The Park Service also offers a more comprehensive \"America the Beautiful\" pass, which costs $80 and can be used at all national parks nationwide.",
      "Some of the National Park Service's most popular sites \u2014 like Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon \u2014 charge entrance fees of $20 per person or $35 per vehicle.",
      "Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place. The order did not detail what those preferential treatment rules would entail, but some popular national parks have reservation systems for entry and camping during peak seasons.",
      "The order Thursday also revoked a memorandum signed in January 2017, at the tail end of former President Barack Obama's second term, which sought to promote diversity and inclusion at national parks. The move appeared to be part of the ongoing effort by the Trump administration to scale back the federal government's diversity efforts.",
      "The latest moves come as the Trump administration has sought to reduce the size of the National Park Service's staff. It laid off about 1,000 Park Service employees in February as part of its push, led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, to enact large-scale personnel and budgetary cuts across the federal government.",
      "According to analysis released this week by the National Parks Conservation Association, an independent advocacy group, the Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since President Trump took office in January.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year budget, the Interior Department also proposed cutting more than $1 billion to the Park Service, which would be the largest such budget cut in the agency's history.",
      "And in a separate executive order Thursday, the president also established the \"Make America Beautiful Again\" Commission, which will be tasked, among other things, with \"expanding access to public lands and waters for recreation and incentivizing voluntary conservation efforts.\"",
      "The commission will be chaired by Burgum and made up of members of the Trump administration. The order itself was spearheaded by Benji Backer, founder and CEO of the group Nature Is Nonpartisan.",
      "\"It's an honor to lead this nonpartisan initiative with the White House,\" Backer said in a statement Thursday. \"Today is a great victory for the environment, but this is just the beginning.\"",
      "In a June 19 interview with CBS News, Backer was critical of a language in early Senate versions of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful, bill\" that would have allowed thousands of acres of public lands to be sold for housing and infrastructure development.",
      "That language was eventually removed from the version of the bill that passed the House on Thursday and heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "\"Just because something isn't a national park or a national wilderness area, doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve to be in public hands,\" Backer told CBS News at the time. \"Donald Trump's legacy will not be good on conservation if this goes through.\"",

      "The Trump administration laid off about 1,000 NPS employees in February as part of its push, led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, to enact large-scale personnel and budgetary cuts across the federal government.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed the signature piece of legislation of President Trump's second term, approving a massive bill that includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts while ramping up funding for defense and implementing the administration's immigration agenda.",
      "The lower chamber voted 218 to 214 to approve the measure, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania \u2014 joining all Democrats in opposing the bill. The Senate passed the legislation, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" earlier this week.",
      "President Trump plans to sign the bill at a ceremony at the White House on Friday, coinciding with the July 4 holiday.",
      "The vote came after a marathon overnight session that saw GOP leaders overcome internal opposition to advance the bill, paving the way for final passage. Most Republican members who balked at many of the changes the Senate made to the legislation eventually relented and voted to pass it.",
      "Once it became clear that GOP leaders had the votes they needed, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to delay the inevitable by speaking on the floor for 8 hours and 44 minutes, setting the record for the longest House speech in U.S. history. He called out Republicans for the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, highlighting the Americans who he said would suffer because of the bill.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation's passage after the vote, outlining the long path to passage since the bill was initially dreamt up more than a year ago, while saying it all came down to \"belief.\"",
      "\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do as a group. We believed in the election cycle last fall that we were going to be given this great blessing of unified government,\" Johnson said. \"And we did not want to waste that opportunity.\"",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance, due to the cuts to Medicaid and programs under the Affordable Care Act. It would also dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, a key priority for Republicans and the president.",
      "GOP opposition melts away",
      "The final vote came after House GOP leadership scrambled Wednesday and into the wee hours Thursday to shore up support for the measure ahead of a key procedural vote to approve the rules for debate on the floor.",
      "Although Johnson spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May, the Senate made a number of tweaks that irked House members on a number of fronts \u2014 from its cuts to Medicaid to its impact on the deficit. Johnson acknowledged that the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred,\" though he repeatedly urged that the final product was largely what the House had signed off on in May.",
      "The Senate-passed bill included steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction that irked many House members. Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House pressured House Republicans to vote for the bill.",
      "The vote on the key procedural hurdle began around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and didn't wrap up until about 3:20 a.m. Thursday. Five House Republicans initially voted no on the rule, which would have been enough to tank the vote. But GOP leaders kept the vote open as they worked to shore up support, allowing lawmakers to change from no to yes.",
      "Johnson told reporters that Mr. Trump was \"directly engaged\" with skeptical members to get them onboard.",
      "\"Members wanted to hear certain assurances from him about what's ahead, what the future will entail, and what we're going to do next, and all of that,\" Johnson said. \"And he was very, very helpful in that process.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure over Truth Social as a handful of Republican holdouts didn't appear to be budging, declaring: \"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\"",
      "\"What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote shortly after midnight.",
      "The House ultimately voted 219 to 213 to advance the bill in a key victory for Republican leaders, who won the support of about a dozen GOP opponents to the rule. And when the vote finally came to an end, Fitzpatrick was the sole Republican opposed. He would also vote against final passage.",
      "Johnson told reporters that the breakthrough came amid help from the president, along with lengthy listening sessions with the bill's opponents, \"making sure that their concerns were addressed.\"",
      "\"A lot of people had to take the time to thoroughly go through the Senate's changes to our bill and that's fine,\" Johnson said. \"That was necessary to get them to yes.\"",
      "Ultimately, only Massie and Fitzpatrick bucked GOP leaders to vote against the legislation. Massie, a conservative, had drawn the ire of the president due to his stance against the bill for weeks. He said in a statement after Thursday's vote that he voted against it \"because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said that the Senate's changes to the initial House legislation were too drastic for him to support.",
      "\"[I]t was the Senate's amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community,\" the Pennsylvania Republican said in a statement, referring to his district. \"The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard. I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\"",

      "Republicans are relatively more likely to say they've flown a flag themselves to display patriotism, and at times to make a political statement, each more often than Democrats say they have.",
      "The flag and protest",
      "Over the decades, polling has asked whether it should be legal to destroy or burn the flag as a form of protest. Most Americans think that should be against the law. Most also thought so 35 years ago, too. (There are partisan differences on this, with Republicans especially likely to say so.)",
      "And a large majority of Americans say the U.S. flag doesn't have to be displayed solo to signify patriotism \u2014 three-quarters think one can fly the flag of one's country of family heritage, along with the American flag and still be patriotic.",

    "summary": "Edward Kelley faced a separate prosecution for targeting federal agents while he was being investigated for his role in the Capitol attack.",
    "story": [
      "A Tennessee man pardoned by President Trump in January for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol will nevertheless serve a life sentence for plotting to attack FBI agents and seeking to incite a \"civil war,\" according to prosecutors.",
      "Edward Kelley, who was the fourth U.S. Capitol rioter to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021, faced a separate prosecution for targeting federal agents while he was being investigated for his role in the Capitol attack.",
      "The Justice Department argued Kelley created a \"kill list\" of FBI agents and others who investigated his role in the Jan. 6 siege. Prosecutors said Kelley \"distributed this list \u2014 along with videos containing images of certain FBI employees identified on the list \u2014 to a co-conspirator as part of his 'mission.'\"",
      "A jury convicted Kelley of conspiracy charges in November, and a federal judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced Kelley to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "Though Kelley was among the more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants pardoned on January 20, 2025, the pardon did not extend to Kelley's conspiracy case in Tennessee. Last month, prosecutors argued, \"Edward Kelley is remorseless and has shown neither a capacity nor desire to rehabilitate. On the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination.\"",
      "Prosecutors also said, \"The proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home.\"",
      "They argued Kelley viewed \"the FBI as the enemy and, as such, were valid targets in the civil war because they served as the 'eyes and ears' of the government.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said, \"The defendant identified 36 individual federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel to target for assassination. He created a list of his targets which included names, titles, and cell phone numbers.\"",
      "Kelley is one of several Jan. 6 defendants who face prison time in separate criminal cases, including some who have been arrested again after their pardons were issued.",
      "A Florida defendant was arrested later in January 2025 on a gun charge. A Texas defendant who was freed from prison by the Trump pardon was later arrested, suspected of attempted child solicitation.",
      "Kelley's role on Jan. 6, 2021, was distinct. Security camera photos showed he was the fourth person to unlawfully enter the Capitol building at the forefront of the mob and he was accused of being part of a group that assaulted an officer. He was also among the group that confronted lone officer Eugene Goodman outside the U.S. Senate chamber as Senators evacuated to safety.",
      "The Justice Department press release issued Tuesday to announce Kelley's prison sentence did not make a reference to Jan. 6. Prior announcements in his case, from 2022, specified Kelley's alleged role in the Capitol siege.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. base in Djibouti; the administration says they'll be sent to South Sudan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, clarifying the scope of its earlier order that lifted restrictions on removals to countries that are not deportees' places of origin.",
      "Shortly after the ruling, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin announced, \"these sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,\" calling it a \"win for the rule of law.\"",
      "In a social media post Thursday evening in response to the ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, \"Yet another rogue district court judge has been rebuked by the Supreme Court thanks to the tireless work of dedicated DOJ attorneys. @POTUS will continue to exercise his full authority to remove killers and violent criminal illegal aliens from our country.\"",
      "The high court's follow-up ruling came after it paused a federal judge's April injunction that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to so-called third countries without first giving them notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation there by raising fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "Soon after that order by the Supreme Court last month, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy said that a decision he issued in May requiring the Trump administration to provide interviews with U.S. asylum officers to the men detained in Djibouti before removing them to South Sudan remained \"in full force and effect.\"",
      "Those men \u2014 who hail from Latin America and Asia, and have been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. \u2014 have been held at the Djibouti base for weeks after Murphy ordered the Department of Homeland Security to retain custody of them. The Trump administration has described deplorable and dangerous conditions faced by the personnel sent to guard the men in Djibouti, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "Murphy issued his order in May after finding that the Trump administration violated his initial injunction when it attempted to swiftly remove the migrants to South Sudan with less than 24 hours' notice and no chance to raise fear-based claims. The world's youngest country, South Sudan remains plagued by violence and political instability, with the State Department warning Americans not to travel there.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the State Department has received \"credible diplomatic assurances\" from South Sudan that the migrants will not be subject to torture.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday said Murphy's May order \"cannot now be used to enforce an injunction that our stay rendered unenforceable,\" referring to the April injunction from Murphy that the high court paused last month. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a concurring statement that, while she opposed the Supreme Court's initial pause, \"I do not see how a district court can compel compliance with an order that this Court has stayed.\"",
      "In a dissent that was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the high court's majority was effectively allowing the Trump administration to pursue \"unlawful ends,\" expressing concern about the safety of the deportees.",
      "\"What the Government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "The legal fight",
      "The Supreme Court's original order last month was a significant legal victory for President Trump and his mass deportation campaign. As part of that effort, administration officials have sought to convince countries around the globe, including in far-flung parts of Africa, to accept deportees who are not their citizens. Several countries \u2014 including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and Kosovo \u2014 have already agreed to host migrants from other nations who have been deported from the U.S.",
      "The high court's decision in June was unsigned and did not contain any reasoning, prompting questions as to whether the Trump administration could move to deport the migrants being held in Djibouti to South Sudan, as it was initially trying to do. The three liberal justices \u2014 Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 dissented.",
      "After Murphy clarified that the Department of Homeland Security could not yet remove the men without first providing them additional process, Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought further word from the justices.",
      "Sauer, who represents the government before the court, argued that the justice's decision meant there is no injunction in place barring the deportation of the migrants in Djibouti. Murphy's ruling, he wrote, \"is a lawless act of defiance that, once again, disrupts sensitive diplomatic relations and slams the brakes on the executive's lawful efforts to effectuate third-country removals.\"",
      "\"This court should immediately make clear that the district court's enforcement order has no effect, and put a swift end to the ongoing irreparable harm to the executive branch and its agents, who remain under baseless threat of contempt as they are forced to house dangerous criminal aliens at a military base in the Horn of Africa that now lies on the borders of a regional conflict,\" Sauer said.",
      "Immigration attorneys disagreed and told the Supreme Court in a filing that Murphy's May order \"is the only shield that preserves and protects their statutory, regulatory, and due process rights to seek protection from torture in South Sudan.\"",
      "They said that the judge's order requiring the government to retain custody of the eight deportees and provide them reasonable-fear interviews was simply a remedy that was issued to address the Trump administration's violation of his injunction.",
      "Plus, the immigration attorneys said that when the Justice Department first sought the Supreme Court's intervention to resume third-country deportations, it did not seek relief from that follow-up order regarding the attempted removals to South Sudan.",
      "\"Because the district court's remedial order is not before the court, it remains in effect,\" they argued. \"Any other conclusion would reward the government's defiance of the district court's orders.\"",
      "The back-and-forth over the third country removals before the Supreme Court has played out on its emergency docket, where the Trump administration has requested relief while legal proceedings play out. Decisions on those requests are typically made only with written briefing and no oral argument, and the court's decisions often do not include its reasoning or how its members voted.",
      "The Trump administration has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals with the Supreme Court, many arising from its efforts to curtail illegal immigration into the U.S. The high court has allowed the government to end two programs protecting nearly 1 million migrants from deportation while the challenges move forward.",
      "But it has also said that migrants facing swift deportation under a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 There's no filibuster in the House, but Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway as the House debated President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" before it passed on Thursday.",
      "Jeffries held the House floor for more than eight hours, taking his \"sweet time\" with a marathon floor speech that delayed passage of Republicans' massive tax and spending cuts legislation and gave his minority party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an \"immoral\" bill.",
      "As Democratic leader, Jeffries can speak for as long as he wants during debate on legislation \u2014 hence its nickname on Capitol Hill, the \"magic minute,\" that lasts as long as leaders are speaking.",
      "He began the speech at 4:53 a.m. ET and finished at 1:37 p.m. ET, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, breaking the record set by then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California in 2021, when he was the GOP leader. McCarthy spoke for 8 hours, 32 minutes when he angrily criticized Democrats' \"Build Back Better\" legislation, breaking a record set by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, when she spoke about immigration for 8 hours, 7 minutes in 2018.",
      "\"I feel an obligation, Mr. Speaker, to stand on this House floor and take my sweet time,\" Jeffries said as he opened.",
      "The speech pushed a final vote on Mr. Trump's tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours. The New York Democrat used the time to criticize the bill's health care and food aid cuts, tax breaks for the wealthy and rollbacks to renewable energy programs, among other parts of the bill that Democrats decry.",
      "He also killed time by riffing on hip-hop, King George III and his own life story, among other diversions. He called out Republicans who have voiced concerns about the bill, read stories from people concerned about their health care from those GOP lawmakers' districts and praised his own members, some of whom sat behind him and cheered, clapped, laughed and joined hands.",
      "\"This reckless Republican budget is an immoral document, and that is why I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives with my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus to stand up and push back against it with everything we have,\" Jeffries said.",
      "He ended the speech in the cadence of a Sunday sermon, with most of the Democratic caucus in a tight huddle around him. One colleague called out, \"Bring it home, Hakeem!\"",
      "\"We don't work for President Donald Trump,\" Jeffries said, as a handful of Republicans across the aisle sat silent and occasionally snickered at the leader as he kept talking.",
      "He invoked the late John Lewis, a civil rights activist in the 1960s and longtime Democratic congressman from Georgia. \"Get into good trouble, necessary trouble,\" Jeffries said. \"We're going to press on until victory is won.\"",
      "Jeffries sneaked small bites of food and drank liquids to boost his energy, but did not leave the chamber or his podium. The speech would be over if he did.",
      "Democrats were powerless to stop the huge bill, which Republicans passed by using an obscure budget procedure that bypasses the Senate filibuster. So they were using the powers they did have, mostly to delay. In the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forced Senate clerks to read the bill for almost 16 hours over the weekend.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey similarly gained attention in April when he spoke for more than 25 hours on the Senate floor about the first months of Mr. Trump's presidency and broke the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history. Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, but Jeffries' \"magic minute\" did not allow for any interaction with other members.",
      "Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty. When the speech was over, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri, called it \"a bunch of hogwash.\"",
      "The speech \"will not change the outcome that you will see very shortly,\" Smith said.",
      "After the bill passed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Democrats \"wanted to speak for hours and hours and break records because they wanted to stand in the way of history.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda Thursday, sending the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" to the president's desk ahead of a July 4 deadline.",
      "The House approved the bill in a 218 to 214 vote Thursday, after the Senate narrowly approved\u00a0the bill Tuesday in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "At the center the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was slated to sunset at the end of the year. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by significant cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own initial version of the legislation last month, with some key differences\u00a0to the final Senate-crafted version. The lower chamber approved the Senate's changes Thursday, sending the measure to the president's desk.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, wasn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules. The parliamentarian also weighed in on what's known as the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the initial House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the initial House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the initial House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Green energy policies",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",
      "It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems.",
      "The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities. Existing contracts and grants under the program are not affected.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the initial House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the initial House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress aimed to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the bill, $300 less than the initial House-passed hike.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence arm plans to cut nearly three-quarters of its full-time employees, shaving its Office of Intelligence & Analysis down from about 1,000 staff to just 275, according to four sources briefed on the matter.",
      "The exact timing of the cuts remains unclear; sources tell CBS News the staff reductions have been in the works for months but were temporarily on hold because of rising tensions overseas after the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The decision has raised concerns among the nation's police and intelligence gathering agencies, as the U.S. reckons with a heightened threat environment.",
      "DHS' Office of Intelligence & Analysis \u2014 created after the September 11 terrorist attacks \u2014 is the only member of the U.S. intelligence community tasked with sharing threat information to state, local, tribal and territorial governments across the country.",
      "A DHS spokesperson confirmed the cuts in a statement, saying the department is getting \"back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.\"",
      "\"DHS component leads have identified redundant positions and non-critical programs within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Department is actively working to identify other wasteful positions and programs that do not align with DHS's mission to prioritize American safety and enforce our laws.\"",
      "Last month, the current head of the agency, Daniel Tamburello, informed the intelligence agency's workforce that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had signed off on plans to slash the agency by hundreds of employees, with others reassigned to other DHS components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "This week, House and Senate lawmakers wrote to Noem and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, warning them to avoid \"this drastic and unilateral step and instead to consult with Congress about alternative ways to make I&A as effective and efficient as possible.\"",
      "\"At a time when DHS is rightly warning about an elevated threat environment from terrorists and cartels, we should be focused on plugging security gaps rather than senselessly creating new ones,\" Democratic Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Jim Himes of Connecticut wrote Wednesday, along with Michigan Sen. Gary Peters and minority leaders on the House Homeland Security Committee, House Intelligence Committee and Senate Homeland Security Committee.",
      "Several law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, County Sheriffs of America and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies \u2014 also penned a letter to Noem, pressing her to reconsider. They warned that any downsizing of the intelligence agency could prevent \"vital intelligence\" from reaching the officers and investigators whose job it is to detect and disrupt threats and could create \"dangerous blind spots in our homeland security network.\"",
      "\"[Intelligence and Analysis] is the only component of the U.S. intelligence community with a statutory mandate to share threat information with state and local partners,\" the letter stated. \"The current threat landscape makes our partnership with [Intelligence and Analysis] more critical than ever. Ongoing Middle East conflicts heighten risks of foreign-directed and homegrown violent extremism, as demonstrated by the recent antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado. Transnational criminal organizations continue to shift fentanyl trafficking routes, requiring real time intelligence to intercept deadly substances before they reach our streets\u2026 Weakening [Intelligence & Analysis] would undermine our ability to detect and prevent threats before they occur.\"",
      "Mike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, a network of 2,000 public safety officials operating as hubs of information sharing and threat analysis for local law enforcement, also wrote to congressional leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last month. He warned that \"any reduction in [Intelligence and Analysis'] field-based presence, staffing, or engagement capabilities would negatively impact the critical information flow and coordination necessary to identify and mitigate emerging threats to our communities.\"",
      "Leaders within the National Sheriffs' Associations had a similar message for congressional leaders last month, writing in a letter to GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, that \"[Intelligence & Analysis] is a critical partner in the operations of many of the country's regional fusion centers\u2026 at the center of detecting threats from organized crime, threats to election security, and threats from domestic violence extremism.\"",
      "Last month, DHS activated its National Terrorism Advisory System, alerting more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide of possible \"violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel, or linked to the US government or military in the Homeland.\"",
      "\"US law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020,\" the bulletin read. \"During this timeframe, the Iranian government has also unsuccessfully targeted critics of its regime who are based in the Homeland for lethal attack.",
      "Offices within the intelligence community, including the CIA and National Security Agency, have faced similar buyouts and workforce reductions in recent months, as well as the nation's top cyber defense agency.",
      "The cuts were first reported by NextGov/FCW.",
      "DHS' intelligence wing has faced some criticism in recent years for its collection of intelligence on journalists and protesters during the George Floyd protests in 2020, plus its failure to disseminate critical intelligence ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
      "While testifying before Congress, Matthew Kozma, Trump's new pick to lead Intelligence & Analysis, underscored the importance of reinforcing the federal government's talent pipeline, telling lawmakers, \"It's imperative that [the agency's] analysts be informed, educated and trained on the latest know-how and toolsets to optimally apply available knowledge, insights, and acumen for mission accomplishment.\"",
      "\"Our intelligence and analytical tradecraft requires a unique combination of skill, curiosity, dedication, vigilance, and trustworthiness to ensure that the information and intelligence we extract and share is correct, comprehensive, and corroborated,\" Kozma said in his opening statement.",

    "summary": "The FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers about COVID shot approvals.",
    "story": [
      "Top-ranking Food and Drug Administration officials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.",
      "In a memorandum following Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.",
      "Prasad was named earlier this year to replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad was later elevated to the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "Novavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.",
      "Prasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"",
      "\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.",
      "A separate memo released by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.",
      "The agency's career scientists had initially concluded on April 1 that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.",
      "\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.",
      "Documents released last month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.",
      "\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"",
      "The New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.",
      "Under Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.",
      "\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had said at an event last year.",
      "In past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, who questioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials \u2014 Dr. Phil Krause \u2014 is also now criticizing moves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.",
      "Agency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.",
      "Months before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.",
      "Hoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"",
      "\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political \u2014 it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.",
      "Makary and Prasad also made this argument in May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.",
      "The FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.",
      "Health care providers are also allowed to give vaccines \"off-label\" outside of the FDA's label and CDC recommendations, once the FDA has approved sales, though that risks running afoul of insurance coverage and liability protections.",

    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he does not plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will take up cases involving laws in Idaho and West Virginia that prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will consider whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, setting up a high-profile clash that could have far-reaching implications across the country.",
      "The justices agreed to decide whether laws from Idaho and West Virginia that prevent transgender girls and women from competing in female athletics violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. The cases involving transgender rights come after the court's conservative majority upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors last month.",
      "Beginning in its next term in October, the Supreme Court will review lower court decisions in favor of transgender athletes from Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the bans in their respective states. The Idaho case involves the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, while the dispute over West Virginia's law involves the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "The issue of transgender athletes participating in girls' and women's sports has exploded at the state level in recent years. Idaho was the first state to pass a law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in women and girls' sports, and two dozen have since followed suit. Roughly half of the states have also passed laws that bar certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "At the federal level, President Trump signed an executive order in February that aimed to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The president's order directs that under Title IX, educational institutions that receive federal funds cannot \"deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.\"",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's executive order, the NCAA announced it had updated its participation policy for transgender athletes to bar student-athletes who were assigned male at birth from competing on women's teams. On Wednesday, the University of Pennsylvania said it would no longer allow transgender athletes\u00a0to participate in women's sports as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school after it awarded Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, a spot on the women's swimming team.",
      "\"Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,\" said Joshua Block of the ACLU, which is representing the athletes in the cases, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson. \"We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.\"",
      "West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey said he is confident the Supreme Court will uphold his state's law.",
      "\"It's a great day, as female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \"The people of West Virginia know that it's unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that's why we passed this commonsense law preserving women's sports for women.\"",
      "Idaho's law",
      "Idaho's measure, called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, requires athletic teams or sports to be designated based on biological sex, and says those for women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\" If there is any dispute about a student's sex, the law says schools must ask for a health examination and consent form verifying the student's biological sex.",
      "After Idaho's GOP-led legislature passed the legislation, Hecox, a transgender woman who was attending Boise State University, sued, arguing the law violates Title IX and the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law. Hecox was a freshman when she filed her lawsuit in April 2020, and she said she wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore, but couldn't do so because of Idaho's ban.",
      "Hecox has received treatment for gender dysphoria since 2019, including testosterone suppression and estrogen, according to court papers.",
      "A federal district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding that Hecox was likely to succeed in her challenge. U.S. District Judge David Nye wrote in August 2020 that the ban \"on its face discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\"",
      "Additionally, Nye found the measure discriminates against transgender women by categorically excluding them from female sports and subjects participants in female athletics to a \"potentially invasive\" process for verifying a student's biological sex.",
      "As a result of the district court's order, Hecox tried out for the women's NCAA running teams at Boise State, but did not qualify. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running at the university, according to court filings.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the district court's injunction as applied to Hecox, finding that Idaho's ban targets all transgender girls and women regardless of their testosterone levels or whether they have received certain gender-transition treatments.",
      "The appeals court said that the record in the case doesn't back \"the conclusion that all transgender women, including those like Lindsay who receive hormone therapy, have a physiological advantage over cisgender women.\"",
      "The West Virginia law",
      "West Virginia's legislature passed its law, the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021, which restricts participation on girls' sports teams based on biological sex, defined as a student's \"reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" The law prohibits transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports at every level, including club and intramural activities.",
      "State officials have argued the law aims to protect equality in girls' sports, and it does not prevent anyone from trying out for men's, boys' or co-ed teams.",
      "\"It is only when students are playing skill and contact sports \u2014 where biological sex has a direct effect\u2014\u00a0 that biological males (again, however they might identify) cannot compete with females,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson, who was then 11 years old, challenged the measure, arguing it is unconstitutional and violates Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Pepper-Jackson, now a teenager, was born male but began identifying as female at \"an early age,\" lawyers wrote in court papers. She has received puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy.\u00a0 When Pepper-Jackson was a rising sixth grader and preparing to begin middle school, she was informed by her school's principal that she could not participate in girls' school sports because of West Virginia's law.",
      "A federal judge in July 2022 temporarily blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling its application would likely violate Title IX and the Constitution. As a result of the injunction, she was able to participate in her middle school girls' cross-country and track-and-field teams.",
      "In early 2023, U.S. District judge Joseph Goodwin ruled for the state and upheld the law. He also lifted the earlier injunction that had blocked enforcement against Pepper-Jackson.",
      "\"A transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically,\" he wrote. \"The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.\"",
      "Pepper-Jackson appealed and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit for emergency relief, which would've allowed her to participate in the spring 2023 track-and-field season.

      "Citing Pepper-Jackson's years-long identity as a girl, social transition, name change, updated birth certificate listing her as a female and medical treatments, the 4th Circuit's majority said offering her a \"'choice' between not participating in sports and participating only on boys teams is no real choice at all.\"",
      "\"By participating on boys teams, B.P.J. would be sharing the field with boys who are larger, stronger, and faster than her because of the elevated levels of circulating testosterone she lacks,\" Judge Toby Heytens wrote. \"The act thus exposes B.P.J. to the very harms Title IX is meant to prevent by effectively 'exclud[ing]' her from 'participation in' all non-coed sports entirely.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to review a blocked Montana law that would require physicians to obtain a parent's consent before performing an abortion on a minor, leaving intact a state high court decision that invalidated the requirement.",
      "In rejecting the appeal from Montana state officials, the high court turned away what the officials said was a chance to clarify the scope of parents' right to be informed of and participate in their children's medical decisions, including abortion.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote a separate statement respecting the court's decision not to take up the case. Alito said the case is a \"poor vehicle\" for deciding the question at hand.",
      "\"It is therefore especially important that the denial of review is not read by interested parties or other courts as a rejection of the argument that the petition asks us to decide,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The long-running dispute dates back to 2013, when the Montana legislature approved the Parental Consent for Abortion Act, which requires physicians to obtain notarized written consent from a parent or guardian before performing an abortion for patients under the age of 18. The law allows a minor who cannot get parental consent to access abortion care through a court order.",
      "Before the consent law took effect, in July 2013, Planned Parenthood sued to block the measure as a violation of the Montana Constitution. The Montana attorney general agreed to a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the consent requirement, and it has never gone into effect. A separate state law that requires parental notification before an abortion is performed on a minor is in place.",
      "The case languished for several years until the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade. A state trial court ruled that the consent requirement violated the Montana Constitution because it interfered with a minor's right to privacy.",
      "The state appealed, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the district court's decision. It found that when evaluated under the most stringent level of judicial review, strict scrutiny, the consent law was not narrowly tailored to any of Montana's compelling interests that they said justified the requirement.",
      "The consent rule, the state supreme court found, violates the \"fundamental right of a minor to control her body and destiny,\" as guaranteed by the state constitution.",
      "Montana officials asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the state court's decision earlier this year and warned that its view of a minor's right to privacy under the state constitution threatens parental rights under the federal Constitution to direct their child's medical care, including decisions about abortion and access to contraception.",
      "\"State experimentation with the scope of a minor's state constitutional right to seek an abortion threatens to erode parents' federal fundamental rights,\" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen wrote in urging the Supreme Court to take up the appeal.",
      "State officials are asking the justices to decide whether a fundamental right to direct the care and custody of their children includes a right to \"know and participate in decisions\" about their medical care, including getting an abortion.",
      "But lawyers for Planned Parenthood urged the high court to turn away the case because it involves unique provisions of Montana's Constitution \u2014 one that grants all Montana citizens the right to individual privacy and a second that guarantees minors the same state constitutional rights as adults.",
      "State officials, they wrote in a filing,\u00a0\"seek to use the parental right as a cudgel against a minor's rights.\"",
      "\"The court's protection of a minor's right to privacy is not any less of a deserving counterweight to the federal Constitution's guarantee of parental rights, simply because that protection inheres in Montana's constitution,\" Planned Parenthood lawyers wrote.",
      "The Montana Supreme Court recognized the right to abortion under its constitution in 1999, and it is legal up to the point of fetal viability. In the 2024 election, Montana voters approved an initiative that amended the state constitution to \"expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 the man whose mistaken deportation by the Trump administration has fueled a monthslong legal saga \u2014 alleged Wednesday that he faced \"psychological torture\" and \"severe beatings\" after he was sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "The new allegations emerged in a legal filing by attorneys for Abrego Garcia in Maryland federal court, seeking to amend his lawsuit against the Trump administration over his deportation. Abrego Garcia was flown back to the United States in early June \u2014 months after a Maryland judge ordered his return \u2014 and promptly charged with human smuggling in Tennessee, but his attorneys say they're concerned he could be deported again.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have previously described his more than three-week stint at El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, as \"torture.\"",
      "But Wednesday's court filing offers new allegations of his \"severe mistreatment,\" which Abrego Garcia says included \"severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture.\" He says he lost 31 pounds during his time in prison.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was part of a group\u00a0of more than\u00a0250 Venezuelan and Salvadoran men who were\u00a0deported\u00a0from the U.S. to El Salvador and held in CECOT in mid-March. Shortly after his arrival at the Salvadoran mega-prison, an official there said, \"Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn't leave,\" the court filing alleges.",
      "The filing states prison staff then forced Abrego Garcia to strip and change into a uniform, kicked him to make him hurry up, shaved his head and marched him to a cell while hitting him with batons \u2014 leaving him with \"visible bruises and lumps all over his body.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia says he was kept in a crowded, windowless cell with metal bunks and lights that remained on for 24 hours a day. In one case, Abrego Garcia and his cellmates were allegedly forced to kneel for nine hours, and were struck if they fell down.",
      "After more than three weeks, Abrego Garcia says he was transferred to a different area and was \"photographed with mattresses and better food\" in what he believed to be staged images.",
      "Abrego Garcia was eventually transferred to a different prison in early April, but he says he was still denied contact with his attorneys or family members.",
      "Early on during his time at CECOT, Abrego Garcia says prison staff sorted a group of inmates based on whether they had gang tattoos but acknowledged that wasn't the case for him, saying, \"Your tattoos are fine.\" The Trump administration has alleged in the past that Abrego Garcia has tattoos linking him to the gang MS-13, which his lawyers have strongly denied.",
      "Separately, Wednesday's court filing says U.S. immigration agents falsely told Abrego Garcia after his March arrest that he would be allowed to see a judge. Prior to his removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia said he \"repeatedly requested judicial review,\" but officials responded by \"deliberately misleading\" him, according to the court filing.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: \"This illegal alien is an MS-13 gang member, alleged human trafficker, and a domestic abuser. The media's sympathetic narrative about this criminal illegal gang member has completely fallen apart, yet they continue to peddle his sob story. We hear far too much about gang members and criminals' false sob stories and not enough about their victims.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has denied membership in MS-13. His wife sought and received a temporary protective order in 2021 after alleging domestic abuse, but the case was dismissed after she didn't appear at a hearing. She said earlier this year she \"acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar,\" and decided not to move forward with the process because they \"were able to work through this situation privately as a family.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers ask for his return to Maryland",
      "Wednesday's amended lawsuit asks U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to declare the Trump administration's actions unconstitutional and order Abrego Garcia's immediate return to Maryland. The suit also asks Xinis to reinstate a 2019 order that allowed Abrego Garcia to remain out of custody as long as he checks in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement regularly. He is currently being held in pretrial detention in Tennessee.",
      "Xinis has not ruled on Agrego Garcia's lawyers' request to file the amended lawsuit, which would update an earlier suit that led Xinis and the Supreme Court to order the government to \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S. That original lawsuit \u2014 filed in March \u2014 hinged partly on a 2019 court order barring Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador. The government said he was sent there anyway due to an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration asked Xinis last month to dismiss Abrego Garcia's lawsuit as moot, arguing he has already received the relief he requested because the government took \"extraordinary steps\" to return him to the U.S. The administration says Abrego Garcia \u2014 who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 \u2014 has \"no right to remain in the United States.\"",
      "A hearing in Xinis' courtroom is scheduled for Monday.",
      "Abrego Garcia is separately facing criminal smuggling charges in Tennessee, with federal prosecutors alleging he worked to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the U.S. for years. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty.",
      "A judge in Nashville ordered Abrego Garcia to be released ahead of trial last month, but his attorneys asked that he remain in custody, citing fears the Trump administration could detain and deport him on immigration grounds as soon as he leaves jail.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer said in Xinis' courtroom last week that once Abrego Garcia is released from detention, Immigration and Customs Enforcement intends to begin removal proceedings to send him to an unspecified \"third country\" other than El Salvador. The Justice Department maintains   there are \"no imminent plans\" to deport him.",

      "In January 2023, Walls-Kaufman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor federal count of \"parading, demonstrating and picketing in a Capitol building\" in connection with the insurrection. At the time, he acknowledged that he had \"scuffled\" with law enforcement, but did not face any federal assault charges in the case.",
      "He served 60 days in prison on that misdemeanor charge. He was one of hundreds of Capitol insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump in January.",
      "Despite the pardon, Smith's lawsuit went to trial in June. After a lengthy civil trial and just two hours of deliberations, a jury last week ordered Walls-Kaufman to pay her and her late husband's estate $500,000, finding that Walls-Kaufman had assaulted Jeffrey Smith on Jan. 6.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Walls-Kaufman denied striking Smith and called the lawsuit and the verdict \"sadistic.\"",
      "\"It felt like a relief, a relief that all the fighting was worth it, everything that I had done was worth it, and it proves that he was injured,\" Smith said of the jury's decision.",
      "Following her husband's death, Smith became a reluctant but impactful advocate. She successfully lobbied Congress to pass a bipartisan law in 2022 to allow some police deaths by suicide to be designated as \"official line of duty\" deaths.",
      "In March of that year, Washington's Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board officially ruled\u00a0that Smith's death was in the line of duty. Body camera footage obtained by CBS News appeared to show that Jeffrey Smith was the target of multiple assaults on Jan. 6. Those images helped Erin Smith have her husband's designation changed.",
      "Now, Smith is pressing the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington to add her late husband's name to its wall and include him in an honorary ceremony next May.",
      "She is also calling for the memorial to open eligibility for others for whom it's been officially determined to have died by suicide because of injuries on the job.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of a group of migrants seeking asylum and three immigrants' rights groups.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Trump's plan to sharply restrict access to the nation's asylum system, a blow to the president's sweeping crackdown on immigration into the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of 13 individuals seeking asylum in the U.S. and three immigrants' rights groups who argued that a proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on his first day back in office \u2014 which has been a pillar of his immigration agenda \u2014 is unlawful.",
      "In his decision, Moss ruled that neither the Immigration and Nationality Act nor the Constitution give the president and administration officials \"the sweeping authority\" asserted in his proclamation and subsequent guidance implementing the directive.",
      "\"The court recognizes that the executive branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country,\" he wrote. \"But the INA, by its terms, provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country.\"",
      "Moss said that a pair of provisions of federal immigration law do not provide \"the president with the unilateral authority to limit the rights of aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum.\"",
      "He further found that the Constitution does not give the president the authority to \"adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted and the regulations that the responsible agencies have promulgated.\"",
      "In addition to finding Mr. Trump's plan to limit access to asylum, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request to certify a class of all people covered by the president's proclamation or its implementation who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "The judge postponed the effective date of his class-wide order for 14 days to give the Trump administration time to seek emergency relief from the federal appeals court in Washington. He also put off a decision on whether to certify a class of individuals who were subject to Mr. Trump's new asylum rules and are no longer in the U.S.",
      "\"The significance of the decision cannot be overstated,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs. \"The ruling not only means the U.S. will once again be a safe haven for those fleeing persecution but also reaffirms that the laws Congress enacts must be respected by the president.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has rolled out a series of plans aimed at targeting migrants in the U.S. His efforts began on the first day of his second term, when Mr. Trump took unilateral action to prevent most migrants crossing the southern border from applying for asylum or withholding of removal, a type of relief that prevents the Department of Homeland Security from deporting a migrant to their home country because of likely persecution.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation cited an alleged \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and directed administration officials to take action to \"repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States.\"",
      "The migrants and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration in early February and sought to block enforcement of the president's proclamation, arguing it is \"as unlawful as it is unprecedented.\"",
      "Moss, appointed by former President Barack Obama, held a hearing in April to consider their bid to invalidate the plan.",
      "In his decision, the judge found that neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and National Act authorize the changes in immigration law that Mr. Trump has sought to make.",
      "He wrote that the president \"lacks the inherent constitutional authority\" to supplant federal statutes governing removals.",
      "\"To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional,\" Moss wrote.",
      "As with his first term, immigration has remained a focal point of the president's second term, and he has undertaken a number of actions that he says are aimed at targeting the purported \"invasion\" at the southern border. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have sparked legal battles. Mr. Trump has invoked a 1798 wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua and has ended programs put in place by former President Joe Biden that shielded nearly 1 million migrants from the threat of deportation.",

    "summary": "Details on the latest Israel-Hamas ceasefire proposal aren't clear, but President Trump said he hopes \"Hamas takes this Deal.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday that Israel has agreed to a proposal for a two-month ceasefire in its war with Hamas.",
      "\"Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize the 60 Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not give any details on the proposed deal, and it's unclear whether Hamas will accept it. Neither Israel nor Hamas has commented publicly on the terms of a possible agreement.",
      "The president said Qatar and Egypt \u2014 who have previously helped mediate talks with Hamas \u2014 \"will deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next Monday. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects to discuss both Gaza and Iran, which struck a separate ceasefire deal with Israel last week after a 12-day campaign between the two countries that included U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump said a ceasefire could begin \"sometime next week.\"",
      "Prior pushes for a ceasefire have stalled. In late May, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire that would have required Hamas to release 10 living hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as the remains of another 18 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel would have released 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas said it responded with \"notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called Hamas' response \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "The war began when Hamas launched a terror attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with an intense air and ground offensive in the Palestinian territory, killing more than 56,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The two sides have agreed to two prior ceasefire and hostage release deals since the start of the 21-month conflict, the most recent of which ran from January to March.",
      "Since then, Netanyahu has said there is \"no way\" he will agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated, though he left the door open to cutting deals to release hostages.",
      "Israel said Tuesday it had \"expanded its operations to additional areas within the Gaza Strip, eliminating dozens of terrorists.\" Hamas' health ministry said Tuesday some 116 people had been killed across the territory over a 24-hour period.",
      "Separately, in recent weeks, the U.S. has financially supported a controversial new group to distribute food in the Gaza Strip, but the effort has faced frequent reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces near food distribution sites. The group, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has defended its efforts.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:17:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The move is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from the New World screwworm fly, which could devastate its beef industry and even kill household pets.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "The New Shepard capsule's stubby single-stage booster roared to life just after 9:38 a.m. EDT, throttled up to full thrust and smoothly climbed away from Blue Origin's launch site near Van Horn, Texas.",
      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",

It also tests whether a person's face matches their Tinder photos and examines other accounts to make sure no one else is using their likeness. Once verified, users get a blue checkmark on their profile.",
      "According to Tinder, verification data obtained during the face scans is stored for the lifetime of the person's account but gets deleted within 30 days after someone closes their account.",
      "\"Face Check ... is really meant to be about confirming that this person is a real, live person and not a bot or a spoofed account,\" Yoel Roth, Match Group's head of trust and safety, told the outlet.",
      "Photo verification is already one of the safety\u00a0features on Tinder, but users have to opt into it.",

      "Prosecutors claimed during the trial that the sexual encounter was rape, while McLemore's attorney countered it was consensual sex.",

    "summary": "In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge would generate more than $90 million annually.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday calling on the national park system to charge higher entry fees for foreign visitors.",
      "It instructs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 who oversees the National Park Service \u2014 to \"develop a strategy\" to hike entrance fees and recreation pass fees for non-U.S. residents at any national park that currently charges for entry.",
      "\"To fund improvements and enhanced experiences across the park system, I've just signed an executive order to raise entrance fees for foreign tourists while keeping prices low for Americans,\" Mr. Trump said in a Thursday evening rally in Iowa. \"The national parks will be about America first.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Interior Department and the National Park Service regarding when the fee hike may take effect or how much the surcharge for nonresidents could cost.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "Not all national parks charge an entrance fee, and for those that do, the fee varies. Generally, visitors can purchase either a standard daily or weekly pass to one specific park, or an annual pass that can be used at one park or in a certain region of the country. The Park Service also offers a more comprehensive \"America the Beautiful\" pass, which costs $80 and can be used at all national parks nationwide.",
      "Some of the National Park Service's most popular sites \u2014 like Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon \u2014 charge entrance fees of $20 per person or $35 per vehicle.",
      "Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place. The order did not detail what those preferential treatment rules would entail, but some popular national parks have reservation systems for entry and camping during peak seasons.",
      "The order Thursday also revoked a memorandum signed in January 2017, at the tail end of former President Barack Obama's second term, which sought to promote diversity and inclusion at national parks. The move appeared to be part of the ongoing effort by the Trump administration to scale back the federal government's diversity efforts.",
      "The latest moves come as the Trump administration has sought to reduce the size of the National Park Service's staff. It laid off about 1,000 Park Service employees in February as part of its push, led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, to enact large-scale personnel and budgetary cuts across the federal government.",
      "According to analysis released this week by the National Parks Conservation Association, an independent advocacy group, the Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since President Trump took office in January.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year budget, the Interior Department also proposed cutting more than $1 billion to the Park Service, which would be the largest such budget cut in the agency's history.",
      "And in a separate executive order Thursday, the president also established the \"Make America Beautiful Again\" Commission, which will be tasked, among other things, with \"expanding access to public lands and waters for recreation and incentivizing voluntary conservation efforts.\"",
      "The commission will be chaired by Burgum and made up of members of the Trump administration. The order itself was spearheaded by Benji Backer, founder and CEO of the group Nature Is Nonpartisan.",
      "\"It's an honor to lead this nonpartisan initiative with the White House,\" Backer said in a statement Thursday. \"Today is a great victory for the environment, but this is just the beginning.\"",
      "In a June 19 interview with CBS News, Backer was critical of a language in early Senate versions of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful, bill\" that would have allowed thousands of acres of public lands to be sold for housing and infrastructure development.",
      "That language was eventually removed from the version of the bill that passed the House on Thursday and heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "\"Just because something isn't a national park or a national wilderness area, doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve to be in public hands,\" Backer told CBS News at the time. \"Donald Trump's legacy will not be good on conservation if this goes through.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed the signature piece of legislation of President Trump's second term, approving a massive bill that includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts while ramping up funding for defense and implementing the administration's immigration agenda.",
      "The lower chamber voted 218 to 214 to approve the measure, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania \u2014 joining all Democrats in opposing the bill. The Senate passed the legislation, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" earlier this week.",
      "President Trump plans to sign the bill at a ceremony at the White House on Friday, coinciding with the July 4 holiday.",
      "The vote came after a marathon overnight session that saw GOP leaders overcome internal opposition to advance the bill, paving the way for final passage. Most Republican members who balked at many of the changes the Senate made to the legislation eventually relented and voted to pass it.",
      "Once it became clear that GOP leaders had the votes they needed, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to delay the inevitable by speaking on the floor for 8 hours and 44 minutes, setting the record for the longest House speech in U.S. history. He called out Republicans for the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, highlighting the Americans who he said would suffer because of the bill.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation's passage after the vote, outlining the long path to passage since the bill was initially dreamt up more than a year ago, while saying it all came down to \"belief.\"",
      "\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do as a group. We believed in the election cycle last fall that we were going to be given this great blessing of unified government,\" Johnson said. \"And we did not want to waste that opportunity.\"",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance, due to the cuts to Medicaid and programs under the Affordable Care Act. It would also dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, a key priority for Republicans and the president.",
      "GOP opposition melts away",
      "The final vote came after House GOP leadership scrambled Wednesday and into the wee hours Thursday to shore up support for the measure ahead of a key procedural vote to approve the rules for debate on the floor.",
      "Although Johnson spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May, the Senate made a number of tweaks that irked House members on a number of fronts \u2014 from its cuts to Medicaid to its impact on the deficit. Johnson acknowledged that the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred,\" though he repeatedly urged that the final product was largely what the House had signed off on in May.",
      "The Senate-passed bill included steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction that irked many House members. Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House pressured House Republicans to vote for the bill.",
      "The vote on the key procedural hurdle began around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and didn't wrap up until about 3:20 a.m. Thursday. Five House Republicans initially voted no on the rule, which would have been enough to tank the vote. But GOP leaders kept the vote open as they worked to shore up support, allowing lawmakers to change from no to yes.",
      "Johnson told reporters that Mr. Trump was \"directly engaged\" with skeptical members to get them onboard.",
      "\"Members wanted to hear certain assurances from him about what's ahead, what the future will entail, and what we're going to do next, and all of that,\" Johnson said. \"And he was very, very helpful in that process.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure over Truth Social as a handful of Republican holdouts didn't appear to be budging, declaring: \"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\"",
      "\"What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote shortly after midnight.",
      "The House ultimately voted 219 to 213 to advance the bill in a key victory for Republican leaders, who won the support of about a dozen GOP opponents to the rule. And when the vote finally came to an end, Fitzpatrick was the sole Republican opposed. He would also vote against final passage.",
      "Johnson told reporters that the breakthrough came amid help from the president, along with lengthy listening sessions with the bill's opponents, \"making sure that their concerns were addressed.\"",
      "\"A lot of people had to take the time to thoroughly go through the Senate's changes to our bill and that's fine,\" Johnson said. \"That was necessary to get them to yes.\"",
      "Ultimately, only Massie and Fitzpatrick bucked GOP leaders to vote against the legislation. Massie, a conservative, had drawn the ire of the president due to his stance against the bill for weeks. He said in a statement after Thursday's vote that he voted against it \"because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said that the Senate's changes to the initial House legislation were too drastic for him to support.",
      "\"[I]t was the Senate's amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community,\" the Pennsylvania Republican said in a statement, referring to his district. \"The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard. I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\"",

      "Maybe they're onto something \u2014 because Americans' reasons and frequency for displaying the flag do, in fact, differ a bit according to their partisanship.",
      "Republicans are relatively more likely to say they've flown a flag themselves to display patriotism, and at times to make a political statement, each more often than Democrats say they have.",
      "The flag and protest",
      "Over the decades, polling has asked whether it should be legal to destroy or burn the flag as a form of protest. Most Americans think that should be against the law. Most also thought so 35 years ago, too. (There are partisan differences on this, with Republicans especially likely to say so.)",
      "And a large majority of Americans say the U.S. flag doesn't have to be displayed solo to signify patriotism \u2014 three-quarters think one can fly the flag of one's country of family heritage, along with the American flag and still be patriotic.",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee man pardoned by President Trump in January for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol will nevertheless serve a life sentence for plotting to attack FBI agents and seeking to incite a \"civil war,\" according to prosecutors.",
      "Edward Kelley, who was the fourth U.S. Capitol rioter to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021, faced a separate prosecution for targeting federal agents while he was being investigated for his role in the Capitol attack.",
      "The Justice Department argued Kelley created a \"kill list\" of FBI agents and others who investigated his role in the Jan. 6 siege. Prosecutors said Kelley \"distributed this list \u2014 along with videos containing images of certain FBI employees identified on the list \u2014 to a co-conspirator as part of his 'mission.'\"",
      "A jury convicted Kelley of conspiracy charges in November, and a federal judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced Kelley to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "Though Kelley was among the more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants pardoned on January 20, 2025, the pardon did not extend to Kelley's conspiracy case in Tennessee. Last month, prosecutors argued, \"Edward Kelley is remorseless and has shown neither a capacity nor desire to rehabilitate. On the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination.\"",
      "Prosecutors also said, \"The proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home.\"",
      "They argued Kelley viewed \"the FBI as the enemy and, as such, were valid targets in the civil war because they served as the 'eyes and ears' of the government.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said, \"The defendant identified 36 individual federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel to target for assassination. He created a list of his targets which included names, titles, and cell phone numbers.\"",
      "Kelley is one of several Jan. 6 defendants who face prison time in separate criminal cases, including some who have been arrested again after their pardons were issued.",
      "A Florida defendant was arrested later in January 2025 on a gun charge. A Texas defendant who was freed from prison by the Trump pardon was later arrested, suspected of attempted child solicitation.",
      "Kelley's role on Jan. 6, 2021, was distinct. Security camera photos showed he was the fourth person to unlawfully enter the Capitol building at the forefront of the mob and he was accused of being part of a group that assaulted an officer. He was also among the group that confronted lone officer Eugene Goodman outside the U.S. Senate chamber as Senators evacuated to safety.",
      "The Justice Department press release issued Tuesday to announce Kelley's prison sentence did not make a reference to Jan. 6. Prior announcements in his case, from 2022, specified Kelley's alleged role in the Capitol siege.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. base in Djibouti; the administration says they'll be sent to South Sudan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, clarifying the scope of its earlier order that lifted restrictions on removals to countries that are not deportees' places of origin.",
      "Shortly after the ruling, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin announced, \"these sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,\" calling it a \"win for the rule of law.\"",
      "In a social media post Thursday evening in response to the ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, \"Yet another rogue district court judge has been rebuked by the Supreme Court thanks to the tireless work of dedicated DOJ attorneys. @POTUS will continue to exercise his full authority to remove killers and violent criminal illegal aliens from our country.\"",
      "The high court's follow-up ruling came after it paused a federal judge's April injunction that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to so-called third countries without first giving them notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation there by raising fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "Soon after that order by the Supreme Court last month, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy said that a decision he issued in May requiring the Trump administration to provide interviews with U.S. asylum officers to the men detained in Djibouti before removing them to South Sudan remained \"in full force and effect.\"",
      "Those men \u2014 who hail from Latin America and Asia, and have been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. \u2014 have been held at the Djibouti base for weeks after Murphy ordered the Department of Homeland Security to retain custody of them. The Trump administration has described deplorable and dangerous conditions faced by the personnel sent to guard the men in Djibouti, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "Murphy issued his order in May after finding that the Trump administration violated his initial injunction when it attempted to swiftly remove the migrants to South Sudan with less than 24 hours' notice and no chance to raise fear-based claims. The world's youngest country, South Sudan remains plagued by violence and political instability, with the State Department warning Americans not to travel there.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the State Department has received \"credible diplomatic assurances\" from South Sudan that the migrants will not be subject to torture.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday said Murphy's May order \"cannot now be used to enforce an injunction that our stay rendered unenforceable,\" referring to the April injunction from Murphy that the high court paused last month. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a concurring statement that, while she opposed the Supreme Court's initial pause, \"I do not see how a district court can compel compliance with an order that this Court has stayed.\"",
      "In a dissent that was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the high court's majority was effectively allowing the Trump administration to pursue \"unlawful ends,\" expressing concern about the safety of the deportees.",
      "\"What the Government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "The legal fight",
      "The Supreme Court's original order last month was a significant legal victory for President Trump and his mass deportation campaign. As part of that effort, administration officials have sought to convince countries around the globe, including in far-flung parts of Africa, to accept deportees who are not their citizens. Several countries \u2014 including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and Kosovo \u2014 have already agreed to host migrants from other nations who have been deported from the U.S.",
      "The high court's decision in June was unsigned and did not contain any reasoning, prompting questions as to whether the Trump administration could move to deport the migrants being held in Djibouti to South Sudan, as it was initially trying to do. The three liberal justices \u2014 Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 dissented.",
      "After Murphy clarified that the Department of Homeland Security could not yet remove the men without first providing them additional process, Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought further word from the justices.",
      "Sauer, who represents the government before the court, argued that the justice's decision meant there is no injunction in place barring the deportation of the migrants in Djibouti. Murphy's ruling, he wrote, \"is a lawless act of defiance that, once again, disrupts sensitive diplomatic relations and slams the brakes on the executive's lawful efforts to effectuate third-country removals.\"",
      "\"This court should immediately make clear that the district court's enforcement order has no effect, and put a swift end to the ongoing irreparable harm to the executive branch and its agents, who remain under baseless threat of contempt as they are forced to house dangerous criminal aliens at a military base in the Horn of Africa that now lies on the borders of a regional conflict,\" Sauer said.",
      "Immigration attorneys disagreed and told the Supreme Court in a filing that Murphy's May order \"is the only shield that preserves and protects their statutory, regulatory, and due process rights to seek protection from torture in South Sudan.\"",
      "They said that the judge's order requiring the government to retain custody of the eight deportees and provide them reasonable-fear interviews was simply a remedy that was issued to address the Trump administration's violation of his injunction.",
      "Plus, the immigration attorneys said that when the Justice Department first sought the Supreme Court's intervention to resume third-country deportations, it did not seek relief from that follow-up order regarding the attempted removals to South Sudan.",
      "\"Because the district court's remedial order is not before the court, it remains in effect,\" they argued. \"Any other conclusion would reward the government's defiance of the district court's orders.\"",
      "The back-and-forth over the third country removals before the Supreme Court has played out on its emergency docket, where the Trump administration has requested relief while legal proceedings play out. Decisions on those requests are typically made only with written briefing and no oral argument, and the court's decisions often do not include its reasoning or how its members voted.",
      "The Trump administration has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals with the Supreme Court, many arising from its efforts to curtail illegal immigration into the U.S. The high court has allowed the government to end two programs protecting nearly 1 million migrants from deportation while the challenges move forward.",
      "But it has also said that migrants facing swift deportation under a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",

But poet Emma Lazarus reimagined Lady Liberty as a \"mother of exiles,\" welcoming immigrants to the shores of America. Correspondent Mo Rocca looks at how the opening of Ellis Island, the end of restrictive immigration quotas, and John F. Kennedy's evocation of the United States as \"a nation of immigrants\" transformed our country, in this entry in the \"Sunday Morning\" series \"These United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have arrested Mexican boxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. over alleged cartel ties, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. He is \"being processed for expedited removal from the United States,\" DHS said on social media.",
      "He was arrested Wednesday in Studio City, California, the department said. Ch\u00e1vez, who\u00a0recently lost a match\u00a0to influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul, is a Mexican citizen and a former WBC middleweight world champion.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for his alleged involvement in organized crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition and explosives, DHS said in a news release. Ch\u00e1vez is also allegedly believed to be an affiliate of the Sinaloa cartel, which the Trump administration designated a foreign terror organization in January, DHS said.",
      "On June 27, authorities determined that Ch\u00e1vez had made fraudulent statements on a lawful permanent resident application, and was in the country illegally and could be removed. His arrest comes amid the Trump administration's\u00a0crackdown on immigration, including a lawsuit against Los Angeles' \"sanctuary city\" policies.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez legally entered the U.S. with a tourist visa in August 2023. That visa expired in February 2024, DHS said. In April 2024, he filed an application for lawful permanent resident status based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. That citizen, who was not named, also has a connection to the Sinaloa cartel, DHS said.",
      "On Dec. 17, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told ICE that Ch\u00e1vez is an \"egregious public safety threat.\" Internal records from the Biden administration showed that Ch\u00e1vez was not an immigration enforcement priority, DHS said. On Jan. 4, Ch\u00e1vez was allowed to reenter the country through the San Ysidro port of entry on the Mexico border, DHS said.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has faced legal trouble in the U.S. in the past. In January 2012, he was arrested by the California Highway Patrol and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and driving without a license, DHS said. He was convicted on the first charge and sentenced to 13 days in jail and three years' probation.",
      "In January 2023, an arrest warrant was issued for Ch\u00e1vez, alleging his involvement in organized crime. In January 2024, he was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department and charged with illegal possession of any assault weapon and manufacture or import of a short-barreled rifle, DHS said. ESPN reported\u00a0in January 2024 that he unlawfully possessed two AR-style guns without serial numbers. Ch\u00e1vez was convicted and spent several days in jail, ESPN reported, before being released on a $50,000 bond on the condition he enter a residential treatment program.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's attorney, Michael Goldstein, told The Associated Press that the current allegations \"are outrageous and simply another headline to terrorize the community.\" Goldstein also told The AP they were due in court on Monday related to the 2024 gun possession charges.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market remains solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "The health care sector added 39,000 jobs.",
      "The Labor Department also revised up its numbers for April and May by a collective 16,000, a further indication the job market remains on solid ground.",
      "While the labor market remains sturdy, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Federal Chair Jerome Powell has\u00a0said tariffs could start to hobble economic activity and drive up inflation this summer. At a gathering of central bankers in Portugal earlier this week, Powell said\u00a0the Fed has held off lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",

      "The healthy level of job growth likely means the Fed will hold off cutting rates at its meeting this month, experts say. At its most recent meeting, the central bank penciled in two rate cuts by year-end, although some economists predict just one.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks U.S. inflation stemming from tariffs is likely to peak by the fourth quarter, giving the Fed room to lower rates in December to propel economic growth.",
      "\"While there were some elements of softness beneath the better-than-expected headlines, the June employment report was strong enough to allow the Federal Reserve to keep policy on hold as it monitors the impact of tariffs on inflation,\" she said in a research note.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:30:30 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday pulls the plug on federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.",
      "Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.",
      "According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.",
      "Pricier EVs",
      "Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.",
      "\"That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,\" Malmgren said.",
      "The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.",
      "That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.",
      "\"Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,\" Malmgren said.",
      "Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.",
      "How much you save",
      "A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas.",
      "Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.",
      "Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long-term is still less polluting than a gas car.",
      "Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) \u2014 slightly more than the average American drives in a year \u2014 the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation.",
      "Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Cleaner machine",
      "So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.",
      "\"They are a no-brainer,\" Slowik said. \"Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.\"",
      "A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.",
      "Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.",
      "\"If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that's already four to five times more efficient,\" Slowik said.",

    "story": [
      "Barry Morphew, a longtime suspect in his wife's disappearance and murder, was arrested in Arizona on June 20, 2025, two days after he was indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the case of his wife Suzanne Morphew's death. This was the second time Barry Morphew has been arrested and charged in her death. The initial charges were dismissed without prejudice, meaning authorities reserved the right to charge him again.",
      "The latest grand jury indictment alleges new details that are surprising even to those who've been following the case since Suzanne Morphew disappeared on Mother's Day, 2020. Barry Morphew has long stated he had nothing to do with his wife's murder, and the couple's two adult daughters have stood by their father.",
      "After the initial charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed, authorities continued to search for her body and on September 22, 2023, Suzanne Morphew's remains were found in and around a \"shallow, clandestine grave \u2026 less than an hour south of the Morphew residence,\" according to the indictment.",
      "\"The majority of her bones were recovered,\" the indictment states, and a board-certified anthropologist, a botanist, and an entomologist were brought in to analyze the remains and concluded that \"it was unlikely Suzanne decomposed from a fresh body to a skeleton at this location.\"",
      "Dan \"Dan R\" Ridenour, who lives in the Salida area of Colorado where the Morphews lived when Suzanne Morphew went missing, is the news director and operations manager of the Heart of the Rockies Radio. He told \"48 Hours\" that it was hard to make sense of the indictment's allegations against Barry Morphew. \"Why would he do that?\" Ridenour asked. \"Why would he move the body?\"",
      "For one thing, Ridenour noted that Barry Morphew has been under heavy scrutiny since Suzanne Morphew was reported missing. \"There is not a more recognizable face in Salida than Barry Morphew,\" Ridenour said. \"He's going to take that chance and drive 70 miles to the south and dig a shallow grave? There are too many questions.\"",
      "But the indictment is unequivocal: Suzanne Morphew's bones were moved to that location after her body had decomposed elsewhere, meaning it had to have been moved at least twice after her murder. \"She was not initially killed in the San Luis Valley,\" Ridenour said. \"She was moved there. That was not her first grave.\"",
      "In addition, tests revealed that in Suzanne Morphew's bone marrow, the chief toxicologist found a mixture of three chemicals known as BAM. The compound is used to tranquilize wildlife and, the indictment noted, that Barry Morphew has admitted using those drugs to tranquilize deer. He had even admitted to authorities that, one month before Suzanne Morphew disappeared, he had used those chemicals to tranquilize a deer near the breezeway of the Morphew residence.",
      "The chemical compound takes several minutes to cause \"sedation\" the indictment states and tests found \"that [Suzanne's] death was not immediate following BAM exposure because Suzanne Morphew's body had begun to metabolize the drug before she died.\"",
      "Authorities have long suspected that Barry Morphew chased Suzanne Morphew around their house after somehow injecting her with the BAM compound. According to texts, Suzanne Morphew had told Barry Morphew she wanted to divorce \"civilly\" and it was later revealed she was having a two-year affair with a former schoolmate.",
      "The indictment links Barry Morphew to purchases of the BAM compound which is a highly controlled drug. It concludes: \"The prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant updates the case in \"The Suzanne Morphew Case: Nothing is What It Seems,\" airing Saturday, July 5 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "\"This case is incredibly unique,\" says Aya Gruber, now a law professor at the University of Southern California School of Law. \"When you started to dig a little bit deeper, nothing is what it seems.\"",
      "Gruber studied thousands of pages of public documents from the prosecutor, investigators and defense attorneys.",
      "Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on May 10, 2020. She'd been alone that day because her daughters, Macy, 16, and Mallory, 20, were off on a church-sponsored camping trip and planned to return home later that Mother's Day.",
      "After Suzanne Morphew was officially reported missing by a neighbor, investigators began to examine Barry Morphew's story. Friends and relatives told investigators that the marriage was troubled, and agents found a deleted text from Suzanne to Barry on his phone that read: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "But 10 days after Suzanne Morphew disappeared, agents were pulled in a different direction when they found a so-called spy pen belonging to Suzanne. The spy pen has a long battery life and is designed to look and write like an ordinary pen.",
      "But it has one extra feature: it is voice-activated and records conversations. Suzanne Morphew had acquired it, she told a friend, because she suspected Barry Morphew was having an affair and she hoped to use the pen to gather evidence. But the plan backfired.",
      "Investigators listened to what the pen had recorded and, although there was no evidence of Barry Morphew having an affair, they say they heard \"intimate\" conversations between Suzanne Morphew and someone named Jeff.",
      "It was another twist in a case filled with them.",
      "Without knowing who Jeff was or his location when Suzanne Morphew went missing, they could not eliminate him as a person or interest. It took FBI agents six months before they uncovered his identity: Jeff Libler, a man both Suzanne and Barry Morphew knew from their Alexandria, Indiana, high school. Libler and Suzanne Morphew had had a one-time fling after graduation, and she'd reached out to him in 2018 after the Morphews moved to Colorado with a Facebook message that read simply: \"Howdy stranger.\"",
      "\"And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop,\" said Ashley Franco, a former reporter for\u00a0KKTV, the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, who has covered the story from the beginning.",
      "That was enough to ignite a nearly two-year love affair. Libler had a wife and six children. He lived in Michigan and claimed to be there with his family on the day Suzanne Morphew vanished.",
      "Agents eventually discovered the lovers had spoken to each other for dozens of hours, often communicating via secret accounts on WhatsApp and LinkedIn. Libler also admitted that they met for romantic rendezvous in New Orleans, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Indiana.",
      "After Suzanne Morphew disappeared in May 2020, Libler did not contact authorities. Instead, agents say, he deleted the accounts where he had communicated with Suzanne Morphew.",
      "\"What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne,\" said Gruber. \"He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.\"",
      "Libler reportedly told agents he did not want to tarnish Suzanne Morphew's memory, but he also told them he worried that he'd lose his wife, children and job. He also worried he might be considered a suspect. \"He asks the agents, 'Am I a target?'\" said Gruber.",
      "After agents confronted him, he did cooperate, providing a sample of his DNA and passwords to the deleted accounts. Investigators eventually were able to retrace the couple's steps and recovered texts by tapping into the iCloud accounts of Libler and Suzanne Morphew.",
      "Libler was able to provide receipts for a home goods store he'd visited in Michigan on the day Suzanne vanished and he was eventually cleared.",
      "Investigators still had their suspicions about Barry Morphew. They never uncovered any evidence that he was having an affair, but investigators found his actions on that Mother's Day weekend to be suspicious.",
      "They asked Barry Morphew why his phone seemed to be pinging all around his house on the day before Mother's Day and he told them he must have been out shooting chipmunks, which he said were a constant nuisance at the house.",
      "It was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi, but Barry Morphew stood by it, saying he'd shot 85 chipmunks in the two years he owned that Colorado house.",
      "\"And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him,\" said Gruber.",
      "Van Sant asked why. \"Because [agents are] saying, 'Well, you know, now he's admitting to having run around the house. And this is a ridiculous explanation, so it must be the explanation of a guilty person,'\" Gruber replied.",
      "What's more, there was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around the house and neighbors did not recall hearing any type of disturbance during that period of time.",
      "Cases sometimes turn on the smallest of things and, in this case, agents seized upon just such a small item.",
      "Agents had found a small clear plastic cap in the family's dryer that they believed was from a syringe used to inject chemicals into a tranquilizer dart. Barry Morphew acknowledged he knew how to inject chemicals into a dart and that he'd shot many deer for trophies and so he could get their antlers. His garage was filled with deer heads and a pile of antlers. However, there was no working tranquilizer gun found in the home and authorities say Barry's DNA was not on that plastic cap.",
      "Even so, investigators developed a theory that Barry Morphew had shot Suzanne Morphew with a tranquilizer gun and then chased her around the house before she passed out. They found a door frame that was broken and suspected there had been a confrontation.",
      "Agents also tapped into a new investigative tool called digital vehicle forensics.\u00a0They pulled data from his Ford truck's many computers and got the truck to \"talk\" to them. They learned that when Barry Morphew said he was sleeping, the truck's doors were opening and closing.",
      "He was\u00a0arrested and charged\u00a0with first-degree murder and other crimes in May 2021. Barry eventually pleaded not guilty.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:05:47 -0400",
    "summary": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for 8 hours and 44 minutes on Thursday, delaying final passage of Republicans' budget bill.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 There's no filibuster in the House, but Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway as the House debated President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" before it passed on Thursday.",
      "Jeffries held the House floor for more than eight hours, taking his \"sweet time\" with a marathon floor speech that delayed passage of Republicans' massive tax and spending cuts legislation and gave his minority party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an \"immoral\" bill.",
      "As Democratic leader, Jeffries can speak for as long as he wants during debate on legislation \u2014 hence its nickname on Capitol Hill, the \"magic minute,\" that lasts as long as leaders are speaking.",
      "He began the speech at 4:53 a.m. ET and finished at 1:37 p.m. ET, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, breaking the record set by then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California in 2021, when he was the GOP leader. McCarthy spoke for 8 hours, 32 minutes when he angrily criticized Democrats' \"Build Back Better\" legislation, breaking a record set by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, when she spoke about immigration for 8 hours, 7 minutes in 2018.",
      "\"I feel an obligation, Mr. Speaker, to stand on this House floor and take my sweet time,\" Jeffries said as he opened.",
      "The speech pushed a final vote on Mr. Trump's tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours. The New York Democrat used the time to criticize the bill's health care and food aid cuts, tax breaks for the wealthy and rollbacks to renewable energy programs, among other parts of the bill that Democrats decry.",
      "He also killed time by riffing on hip-hop, King George III and his own life story, among other diversions. He called out Republicans who have voiced concerns about the bill, read stories from people concerned about their health care from those GOP lawmakers' districts and praised his own members, some of whom sat behind him and cheered, clapped, laughed and joined hands.",
      "\"This reckless Republican budget is an immoral document, and that is why I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives with my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus to stand up and push back against it with everything we have,\" Jeffries said.",
      "He ended the speech in the cadence of a Sunday sermon, with most of the Democratic caucus in a tight huddle around him. One colleague called out, \"Bring it home, Hakeem!\"",
      "\"We don't work for President Donald Trump,\" Jeffries said, as a handful of Republicans across the aisle sat silent and occasionally snickered at the leader as he kept talking.",
      "He invoked the late John Lewis, a civil rights activist in the 1960s and longtime Democratic congressman from Georgia. \"Get into good trouble, necessary trouble,\" Jeffries said. \"We're going to press on until victory is won.\"",
      "Jeffries sneaked small bites of food and drank liquids to boost his energy, but did not leave the chamber or his podium. The speech would be over if he did.",
      "Democrats were powerless to stop the huge bill, which Republicans passed by using an obscure budget procedure that bypasses the Senate filibuster. So they were using the powers they did have, mostly to delay. In the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forced Senate clerks to read the bill for almost 16 hours over the weekend.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey similarly gained attention in April when he spoke for more than 25 hours on the Senate floor about the first months of Mr. Trump's presidency and broke the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history. Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, but Jeffries' \"magic minute\" did not allow for any interaction with other members.",
      "Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty. When the speech was over, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri, called it \"a bunch of hogwash.\"",
      "The speech \"will not change the outcome that you will see very shortly,\" Smith said.",
      "After the bill passed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Democrats \"wanted to speak for hours and hours and break records because they wanted to stand in the way of history.\"",

    "story": [
      "This story previously aired on July 1, 2023. It was updated on July 3, 2025.",
      "Barry Morphew, a longtime suspect in his wife's Suzanne Morphew's disappearance, has been arrested a second time and charged with her murder after a toxicologist found a unique combination of tranquilizer drugs in her bone marrow, according to a grand jury indictment made public in June 2025.",
      "Morphew has in the past acknowledged using those tranquilizer drugs to knock out deer and cut off their antlers, authorities say.",
      "Barry Morphew was first arrested and charged with Suzanne's murder in 2021, but those charges were dismissed without prejudice, meaning authorities reserved the right to charge Morphew again. He has always maintained his innocence.",
      "When the initial charges were dismissed in April 2022, prosecutors claimed they were close to discovering Suzanne's remains. And on Sept. 22, 2023, agents with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation located her bones in a \"shallow, clandestine grave \u2026 less than an hour from the Morphew residence\" just outside Salida, Colorado, according to the most recent grand jury indictment.",
      "According to an autopsy report, the coroner's office in El Paso County, Colorado,\u00a0declared that Suzanne's death was: \"Homicide by unspecified means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication.\"",
      "Those three drugs make up a compound known informally as BAM to hunters who use it to sedate wildlife. The new indictment states that BAM was found in Suzanne's bone marrow. Barry Morphew was known to be an avid deer hunter whose home was filled with deer heads and antlers.",
      "The indictment links Barry Morphew to purchases of the BAM compound which is a highly controlled drug. It concludes: \"The prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew.\"",
      "In another twist, the indictment noted that Suzanne had not died immediately after being given the drugs. The autopsy revealed that her body had metabolized the BAM. Forensics experts determined she had not decomposed where her bones were found, meaning her remains had to have been moved at least twice.",
      "\"That was not her first grave,\" said Dan \"Dan R\" Ridenour, news director and operations manager at Heart of the Rockies Radio in Salida, CO. He also said he could not fathom why Barry would move Suzanne's body. \"There is not a more recognizable face in Salida than Barry Morphew,\" Ridenour said. \"He's going to take that chance and drive 70 miles to the south and dig a shallow grave? There are too many questions.\"",
      "The indictment does not answer those questions. Barry was arrested in Arizona but waived extradition to Colorado where he will be held on a $3 million cash bond. There is not yet a date for his homicide trial.",
      "When Suzanne first went missing back in 2020, investigators compiled and followed several bizarre clues\u2014a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen\u2014but lacked direct evidence.",
      "Investigators noticed Barry Morphew's cellphone appeared to be pinging all around his house on Mother's Day weekend 2020, which he maintains was because he was chasing and shooting at chipmunks. Investigators also found a plastic cap for a syringe that they believe was used to load a tranquilizer dart in the couple's dryer. Barry Morphew, investigators say, told them he didn't know how the cap got there, but admitted he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. The cap, however, did not contain any of Barry's DNA.",
      "Investigators also found a spy pen right out of a James Bond movie that was able to capture and record conversations. The pen captured several intimate conversations between Suzanne and a secret lover. Investigators also uncovered DNA on the glovebox of Suzanne's Range Rover, which traced back to an unknown male connected to three sexual assaults.",
      "This past week, a prosecutor working on the case of Suzanne Morphew, a missing mother of two, said in open court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body. \"She is in a very difficult spot,\" said Deputy District Attorney Mark Hurlbert. \"We actually have more than just a feeling \u2026 and the sheriff's office is continuing to look for Mrs. Morphew's body.\"",
      "It was a major update in the Morphew case which began on Mother's Day 2020, when she disappeared from her Colorado home. Hurlbert said there was no timetable for bringing a murder case to trial. \"That could be a long time. It could be quick, it could be long. It depends on a lot of our investigation,\" he said.",

      "Before moving to Colorado in 2018, Barry and Suzanne grew up in the small town of Alexandria, Indiana, where they met in high school. Suzanne competed for homecoming queen. Barry was a star baseball player who was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays. Injury ended Barry's dreams of a major league career. They both attended Purdue University and married in 1994. He started a landscaping business. Suzanne taught middle school before becoming a full-time mother.",

      "Macy, 16 years old when her mom disappeared, lived at home. Her sister Mallory attended college and the Morphews told some friends they moved to a home just outside of Salida to be closer to their older daughter. But there were also rumblings about the state of the Morphew's marriage.",

      "In a Zoom interview, Melinda said she received Suzanne's text two days before she disappeared, and it was boiling over with anger toward Barry.",
      "The text read in part: \"He's also been abusive emotionally and physically\u2026 I feel more angry now. Anger at what I've allowed.\"",
      "Melinda Moorman: Barry was very dominant in the relationship, and my sister was a very passive, gentle soul \u2026 he had \u2026 a great tendency to overpower, intimidate people to get what he wanted.",

      "Ashley Franco: Investigators also found that Suzanne, on several instances, had gone on vacation to meet up with Jeff in many different states, ranging from Louisiana to Florida.",
      "Investigators also discovered they'd sent intimate photos to each other, talked of becoming husband and wife, and even mentioned leaving the United States.",
      "Ashley Franco: Jeff and Suzanne had talked about moving away \u2026 moving to Ecuador at one point \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: If you were an investigator instead of a law professor, what would you wanna know about this Jeff Libler?",
      "Aya Gruber: Everything. I'd wanna know everything about what he was doing, what he was thinking. \u2026 Here is somebody who arguably had the last communication \u2026 with Suzanne before she went missing.",
      "The love affair between Suzanne and Jeff became a key part of the investigation as agents tried to figure out what happened to her on that Saturday, May 9, the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Records show that Suzanne and Jeff messaged each other 59 times that day, much more than usual, authorities say.",
      "At one point, Suzanne sends Jeff a selfie. Investigators dub it her last \"proof of life\" photo. Barry was not home, as the lovers' texts heat up:",
      "At 2:05 p.m., Suzanne writes: \"I'm just in love with you. Whatcha up to?\"",
      "Jeff's response at 2:06 p.m. was: \"Want to strip down and get naked? LOL??\"",
      "She responds by saying she'll \"load up\" her WhatsApp account and then at 2:11 p.m., Suzanne writes, \"Okay I'm on WA\".",
      "Then, at 2:26 p.m., Suzanne gets a text from Barry that he's heading home. \"Done headed back.\"",
      "No one knows if Suzanne saw that text or was preoccupied with Jeff, but she does not answer.",
      "Barry follows up, appearing to wonder where Suzanne is. \"Did you leave?\"",
      "There was still no response from Suzanne and investigators speculate the next few moments are when Barry returned home. They notice that Barry's cell phone appears to be pinging all around the outside of his house. Was he chasing Suzanne before a final and fatal confrontation?",
      "Investigators asked Barry to explain that unusual phone activity.",
      "Aya Gruber: And he says, \"Well, lemme think about that. I was probably walking around my house shooting chipmunks.\"",
      "You heard right \u2014 it was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi.\u00a0 Barry says the chipmunks were a constant nuisance at his house and he'd been running around shooting them that day.",
      "Aya Gruber: And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him.",
      "There was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around Barry's house. Part of his problem, Aya says, is that Barry granted between 30 and 40 interviews \u2014 all without a lawyer \u2014 to everyone from a county detective to members of the FBI.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Would you have allowed him to do all these interviews?",
      "Aya Gruber: No. Absolutely not.",
      "Meanwhile, Jeff Libler was cleared. He told agents he was in Michigan that weekend and his alibi checked out. When investigators tell Barry of the affair, he denies knowing anything about it.",
      "But if Barry knew nothing about Suzanne's affair, what motive would he have to kill her? One clue may be a deleted text that investigators found on Barry's phone sent by Suzanne just days before: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "Dan Ridenour: So, the only thing that makes sense is that Barry Morphew lost it when Suzanne finally said, \"I'm leaving you.\"",
      "Barry knew that his daughters would be away on their camping trip that Saturday afternoon and authorities say he took advantage of that opportunity to kill Suzanne and clean up the crime scene.",
      "Peter Van Sant: From 2:47 p.m. until 10:17 p.m., just under 8 hours, Barry's phone goes into airplane mode. What do authorities believe happened during that time?",
      "Ashley Franco: Authorities say that they believe, when his phone went into airplane mode, that he was disposing of possible evidence.",
      "Unable to track Barry's cell phone, investigators tapped into a relatively new investigative technique \u2014 digital vehicle forensics \u2014 to pull a stream of data out of Barry's Ford truck. And Barry's truck told a different story than what he was telling investigators.",
      "Ashley Franco: They were using Barry's own car against him.",
      "IF A TRUCK COULD TALK \u2014  \u00a0IN THIS CASE, IT DID",
      "Ben LeMere is an expert in the new field of vehicle forensics.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Give me a sense of how your technology, from your company, helps solve criminal cases.",
      "Ben LeMere: So, a lotta times it's used to \u2026 locate bodies.",
      "LeMere is the CEO of the Berla Corporation.",
      "Ben LeMere: It helps \u2026 get people convicted. It's helped get people not convicted.",
      "Investigators from Scotland Yard to the FBI have learned how to use Berla's software to tap into the dozens of computers in a car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's accurate enough to be used as evidence in court cases, correct?",
      "Ben LeMere: Yes, sir.",
      "Cases like the disappearance of Suzanne Morphew. Investigators created a Berla report, meaning they tapped into the data in Barry's Ford truck to track its movements after his cell phone went into airplane mode.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 a couple of the pieces of evidence that I think are very harmful to his case \u2014 come from the data in the car \u2026",
      "Ashley Franco: The prosecution's case is that Barry snapped at one point the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Authorities believe Barry killed Suzanne that afternoon. He told agents he went to bed around 8 p.m. that night, but the data pulled from the truck shows that the truck was put in reverse and moved some 96 feet closer to his house around 9:30 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators think that's when he could have loaded Suzanne's body.",
      "Initially, Barry told police that he set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. on Mother's Day and left the house by 5 a.m. to drive to a job site in Broomfield, a town near Denver, 150 miles from Salida. But the truck's computers show that someone was opening and closing the truck's doors around 3:30 a.m.",
      "Investigators believe Barry began driving toward Broomfield much earlier than he claimed, but there is a 4-hour window\u2014approximately 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.\u2014when no activity was recorded by the vehicle's computers.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 there are events in the car \u2014 that aren't recorded. So, they can't give sort of a full chronological picture.",
      "And if Barry hid Suzanne's body during that 4-hour window, the truck's data does not provide answers.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Why is data missing sometimes?",
      "Ben Lemere: Well, it gets overwritten. You know, it is a computer \u2026 Log files, they only last so long.",
      "But Barry helped fill in some of the missing data. He told agents he took a left upon leaving his home instead of a right because, even though it was dark, he remembered seeing some elk.",
      "Ashley Franco: He saw a herd of elk, and he's a hunter. So, he was interested, and he wanted to get an up-close look.",
      "That admission was significant to agents because it put him in an area where a key piece of evidence had been recovered.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators found Suzanne's bike helmet up that road. So, they believe, at that point when he turned left instead of turning right, that he could have been ditching her bike helmet.",
      "At 8:10 a.m. on Mother's Day morning, the truck's computers again begin recording data. And by then, Barry's cell phone had also come back to life. Agents are able to track Barry's cell and truck movements and can see that he first pulled over at a Broomfield bus stop where he discarded something in a garbage can.",
      "Ashley Franco: And then he moves on to a hotel trash can, a McDonald's trash can \u2026 a dumpster \u2026 in a Men's Wearhouse parking lot, and then back to the hotel, and dumps stuff in a dumpster there. Investigators believe that during these \"trash runs,\" he was disposing of evidence in different places within the Denver area.",
      "In a surveillance shot of Barry on one of those trash runs, investigators could not see what he was throwing away. It may have looked incriminating, but Barry claims it was just another day at the office. He told agents he was merely being cheap, not criminal.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And his claim, well, I just always have a lotta junk in \u2014 in the vehicle. I don't like to pay to have it \u2014 disposed at a landfill, I \u2014 this is just what I do.",
      "Ashley Franco: But it's suspicious that you would go to five different trash areas to dispose of several things. Why not just do it at one?",
      "After checking out the work site, Barry headed back to his room at the Holiday Inn, and investigators say he stayed there from 12:42 p.m. to 6:03 p.m. By then, he'd already spoken to older daughter Mallory who told him she could not get in touch with her mother.",
      "That's when the Morphew neighbors were contacted and could find no sign of Suzanne.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry asked them at that time if the bike was there, to go check on her \u2026 her bicycle is not here.",
      "Barry asks his neighbor to call 911.",
      "Dan Ridenour: And that's when the call to 911 \u2026 was placed, that Suzanne is missing.",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry doesn't head home immediately, and he is dropping some tools off for his coworkers.",
      "Tools including a shovel. With Suzanne now officially reported missing, Barry tells his workers there's a family emergency and arranges hotel rooms with one of those workers taking over Barry's room.",
      "Ashley Franco: When the employee was interviewed, he told investigators that \u2026 the room that Barry checked out of, it had a strong smell of chlorine or bleach.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Which suggests what?",
      "Ashley Franco: That he could be cleaning up a crime scene.",
      "Just after 6 p.m., Barry starts driving back to Salida. On the way, Barry speaks to sheriff deputies who advise him they've found Suzanne's bike and he arrives at that ravine at around 8:40 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: And investigators say that when he arrived there, he was pretty emotional for a few minutes.",
      "By Sunday night, Suzanne's daughters were back home but Suzanne is nowhere to be found. Barry offered a $100,000 reward for information that was later doubled to $200,000.",
      "Investigators later discovered many texts from Suzanne to a close friend that apparently revealed her tormented feelings about Barry:",
      "\"He won't speak of divorce \u2026\"",
      "\"I feel no peace when he's here \u2026\"",
      "\"I wouldn't feel safe alone with him \u2026\"",
      "Barry became the prime suspect and investigators think they know how he killed Suzanne.",
      "DID BARRY TARGET SUZANNE?",
      "While investigators searched the Morphew home and the family's cars and trucks, Barry continued to talk, seemingly to anyone with a badge. Weeks and months went by and Barry remained at the center of the investigation.",
      "Aya\u00a0Gruber: \u2026 police are absolutely correct as a statistical matter to look at intimate partners \u2026 when they suspect that a woman might've been harmed or murdered.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's something like eight out of 10 times, when a spouse dies the other one's involved.",
      "Aya Gruber: Absolutely.",
      "Sometimes the smallest item will turn an investigation, and, in this case, agents seized on a clear plastic cap that a forensics team had found in the family's dryer. Prosecutors believe the cap was from a syringe used to fill a tranquilizer dart.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How do prosecutors interpret that?",
      "Aya Gruber: The prosecution's theory is that at some point, when Barry came home on the 9th and snapped, and decided to murder Suzanne, he used a tranquilizer dart that you would use on animals \u2026",
      "There was no working tranquilizer rifle found in the Morphew's home. But Barry told investigators he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. He knew how to load darts with paralyzing chemicals, having used them to illegally sedate deer and remove their antlers to sell.",
      "We asked Dan Ridenour to read some of what Barry told investigators.",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: Barry said, \"The first thing I thought of when I came here and saw deer in my yard with big horns, I'm like, 'I'm getting them horns.'\"",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: \"And I'll tell you exactly what I did \u2026 I shoot 'em. They go to sleep, I cut their horns off \u2026 It's totally illegal \u2026 But you're gonna find tranq darts around my property because I've done that.\"",
      "Experts say it can take between 4 and 20 minutes for an animal the size of a deer to drop after being shot with a tranquilizer dart. Agents theorized that Barry's phone had pinged from various locations around the house\u2014not because he was shooting chipmunks, but because he was chasing Suzanne after he shot her.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators find a doorframe within the Morphew home that has been broken. And they say that there could have been a chase and then a struggle.",
      "Andrew Katers, the owner and CEO of Animal Care and Equipment Services, showed us a tranquilizer rifle he'd typically use on animals.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what are you holding?",
      "Andrew Katers: What I'm holding is a TeleDart model 706 rifle \u2026 they use this a lot in parks throughout the country.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And this does not fire bullets or shot?",
      "Andrew Katers: It only fires darts. \u2026 It's impossible to \u2014 get it to do anything else.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Could you now demonstrate for me?",
      "Andrew Katers: Sure. [fires rifle]",
      "Peter\u00a0Van Sant: So, if Suzanne had been struck by one of these darts \u2026 would she have time to run around, try to escape?",
      "Andrew Katers: She could. But I don't think she would get very far.",
      "Peter Van Sant: For a human being, it could be lethal.",
      "Andrew Katers: For sure.",
      "Bolstering the theory that Barry and Suzanne had a confrontation the day she disappeared were apparent scratches seen on Barry's left arm. Agents took the circumstantial evidence they gathered \u2014 Barry's apparently suspicious behavior, his contradictory statements, the puzzling data from his truck, Suzanne's disturbing texts and those five trash runs \u2014 and brought it all to the district attorney.",
      "On nearly the anniversary of Suzanne's disappearance, Barry is arrested in May 2021.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Tonight, the husband of Suzanne Morphew is behind bars accused of killing her. \u2026 The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office says that Barry Morphew was arrested this morning.",
      "Despite the lack of a body, Barry was charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence, and a variety of other allegations. He was held without bail and eventually pleaded not guilty.",
      "In their arrest affidavit, prosecutors spelled out what they believe happened to Suzanne:",
      "\"It had become clear that Barry could not control Suzanne's insistence on leaving him and he resorted to something he has done his entire life \u2014 hunt and control Suzanne like he had hunted and controlled animals.\"",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda reacted to the news of Barry's arrest.",
      "Melinda Moorman: There are no winners in this story. There are two families who are suffering deeply.",
      "Barry ultimately hired high-profile lawyers from Denver, and, in the summer of 2021, Judge Patrick Murphy heard the prosecution's evidence in open court.",
      "Ashley Franco: He decided to hold a preliminary hearing to see if this case had enough evidence to go to trial.",
      "The defense tried mightily to blunt the state's case, countering that the clear, plastic cap found in the dryer means nothing because no one could say how long it had been there. Furthermore, Suzanne's DNA was found on the cap, not Barry's. And as for that chlorine smell in Barry's hotel room \u2026",
      "Aya Gruber: One of the managers from the Holiday Inn had actually communicated to agents that this smell of chlorine existed before Barry Morphew was there \u2026 because that room's directly above an indoor pool.",
      "And there was one more crucial issue the prosecution had to deal with \u2014 one that its own forensic team uncovered. DNA evidence made public for the first time now threatened to destroy the case against Barry.",
      "Aya Gruber: This DNA discovery is so significant. The agents swab the inside of Suzanne Morphew's car and they found male DNA on the glove box, and it wasn't Barry Morphew's DNA. He was eliminated.",
      "The DNA also did not match Suzanne's lover Jeff Libler. But it did partially match the DNA of an unknown male who had attacked other women and it raised a disturbing question: had Suzanne fallen into the hands of a sexual predator?",
      "DA: AUTHORITIES ARE \"CLOSE\" TO FINDING SUZANNE'S BODY",
      "In September 2021 at the Chaffee County Courthouse in Salida, Judge Patrick Murphy heard arguments about whether there was enough evidence to try Barry Morphew for murder.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge named off three different scenarios, saying, \"Suzanne Morphew left willingly, Barry Morphew could have killed his wife, or someone else abducted Suzanne and killed her.\"",
      "He said it was \"unlikely\" Suzanne had run off on her own, even though she and lover Jeff Libler had discussed moving to Ecuador.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge says that because of the evidence that's \u2026 been presented about how loving Suzanne was toward her daughters and toward her family \u2026 that she could never do that.\"",
      "But the abduction theory could not be so easily dismissed \u2014 especially after that mysterious DNA was found in Suzanne's Range Rover. Investigators learned that DNA at least partially matched the profile of an unnamed man connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in Tempe, Phoenix and Chicago.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So how can that DNA end up in her car?",
      "Aya Gruber: Well, that DNA can end up in her car if she was the victim, for example, of a serial killer \u2026 or if the person was hired or opportunistic \u2026 There could also be potentially an innocent explanation that at some point, you know, the person came in contact with the car randomly as a mechanic \u2026 but it is very, very curious.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Barry Morphew can stand up and say, \"I'm not your killer. The man whose DNA is in my wife's car, tied to past sexual assaults, that's your killer.\"",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew absolutely could say that. And that's what his defense is banking on in this case.",
      "In frank language, Judge Murphy gave his opinion of the state's evidence: \"I find that the proof is not evident nor is the presumption great that Mr. Morphew committed first-degree murder.\"",
      "Despite that, the judge ruled there was probable cause to go to trial.",
      "Aya Gruber: But this judge was very careful to say, \"Look, I'm finding probable cause here, but it's only because I am looking at all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"",
      "Murphy said he was \"obligated\" to set bond for Barry.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge sets $500,000 cash-only bond.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And are they monitoring him in some fashion?",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew is wearing an ankle monitor for them to track him, to make sure that he is staying in Chaffee County.",
      "A few days later on September 20, 2021, Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy are all smiles as they leave the jail. They stand firmly behind their dad. Barry declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview.",
      "Barry Morphew's homicide trial was to begin on April 28, 2022, but in the months leading up to that date Judge Murphy recused himself and and was replaced by Judge Ramsey Lama.. And Barry's defense team, led by attorney Iris Eytan, filed motions asking that prosecutors be sanctioned for \"failing to produce discovery in a timely manner\" including some potentially exculpatory evidence \u2014  like the male DNA found in Suzanne's Range Rover.",
      "Iris Eytan: There's DNA that is placed on all the critical items of evidence in this case \u2014 on the bike, on the bike helmet, in the house, in the car \u2014   that is linked to unknown males.",
      "In April 2022, Judge Lama ruled that prosecutors repeatedly had missed deadlines and had failed to turn over important information in the discovery phase. The judge wrote that while he did not find those actions \"willful \u2026 the court does find this pattern to be negligent, bordering on, reckless.\" The judge's penalty was to knock out 14 prosecution witnesses \u2014 including experts in DNA and cell phone and vehicle data recovery. They would not, he said, be allowed to testify.",
      "Law professor Aya Gruber said the case was going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors even before she heard about the most recent sanctions.",
      "Aya Gruber: This case is incredibly unique. There are not many \u2026 murder cases \u2014   where the defendant has been charged with first-degree murder, where there is no body, no blood evidence of any foul play, no eyewitnesses.",
      "On April 19, 2022, as a pre-trial hearing was about to begin, District Attorney Linda Stanley filed a motion to dismiss the murder charges against Barry Morphew without prejudice, meaning the case could be refiled at a later date. In her motion, the DA pointed to the court's decision to bar \"several key witnesses \u2026 without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"",
      "Neither Barry, his daughters nor his lawyer had any advance warning.",
      "Iris Eytan: I didn't know a dismissal was coming today, although the writing was on the wall \u2026",
      "In her motion for dismissal, Stanley told the judge that officials believe they are close to discovering the location of Suzanne Morphew's body. Court papers specifically mentioned \"a remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence\" that will be excavated after five feet of snow melts.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Where is Suzanne Morphew's body? That is the million-dollar question.",
      "Remember, there was an approximate four-hour gap not recorded by the computers in Barry's truck on Mother's Day morning 2020. Whether investigators ultimately were able to recover some of that missing data or received a tip about the location of Suzanne's remains is not known.",
      "Dan Ridenour: The San Isabel National Forest, again, is 1.1 million acres. There's plenty of places to dispose of \u2014  of a body.",
      "Defense attorney Eytan denies Barry has any involvement in his wife's disappearance.",
      "Iris Eytan: Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew.\u00a0 He loves her and he misses her, and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.",
      "After the judge granted the motion to dismiss homicide charges against Barry, he walked out of court a free man, flanked as usual by his loyal daughters.",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda says she agrees with the request to dismiss charges against Barry at this point. She said she hoped that, with more time, searchers will find Suzanne's body and win \"a solid conviction in her murder. This would dispel all rumors of her whereabouts.\"",
      "And whatever else happens with the case, Melinda says she hopes her nieces keep one thing in mind.",
      "Melinda Moorman: \"Mallory, Macy \u2026 Your mother would have laid down her life for you girls \u2026 She would never leave you. She would never forsake you. She loved you with her whole being.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's remains were found in 2023 in a shallow grave about 40 miles south of their home.",
      "The coroner ruled Suzanne's death a homicide. A combination of drugs commonly used to tranquilize wildlife was found in her bone marrow.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, in a call the Kremlin said lasted nearly an hour.",
      "The call came after the White House confirmed earlier this week the U.S. is halting some weapons shipments to Ukraine. The Trump administration said the decision was made after a Pentagon review of U.S. military support and assistance to other countries. The pause was put in place because of concerns that U.S. military stockpiles were falling too low, a U.S. official said.",
      "The White House has not yet provided a readout of the conversation between the two leaders. But the Kremlin said Mr. Trump began his call with Putin by discussing the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill\" in Congress, and the two leaders discussed the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The president and Putin spoke in mid-June, and Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Russia's war on Ukraine continues with no end in sight. Russia has continued to launch assaults on Ukraine, stymying Mr. Trump's aspirations of a ceasefire.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 14:59:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The House and Senate passed the massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda this week. Here's what's in it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda Thursday, sending the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" to the president's desk ahead of a July 4 deadline.",
      "The House approved the bill in a 218 to 214 vote Thursday, after the Senate narrowly approved\u00a0the bill Tuesday in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "At the center the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was slated to sunset at the end of the year. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by significant cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own initial version of the legislation last month, with some key differences\u00a0to the final Senate-crafted version. The lower chamber approved the Senate's changes Thursday, sending the measure to the president's desk.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, wasn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules. The parliamentarian also weighed in on what's known as the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the initial House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the initial House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the initial House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Green energy policies",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",
      "It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems.",
      "The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities. Existing contracts and grants under the program are not affected.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the initial House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the initial House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress aimed to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the bill, $300 less than the initial House-passed hike.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The Senate\u00a0version\u00a0varies from the initial House-passed provisions on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the early House version was uncapped.",
      "Under the initial House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would have qualified for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version phases out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The bill seeks to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year.",
      "Tracy J.  Wholf and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "\"They do want to have the anti-missile missiles \u2026 the Patriots,\" Mr. Trump told reporters after his meeting with Zelenskyy, \"and we're going to see if we can make some available.\" He added that the Patriots were, \"hard to get.\"",

      "An American teenager was detained on an Antarctic island while attempting to pilot his small plane to every continent, said Chilean authorities, who have charged him for allegedly submitting a false flight plan.",
      "Ethan Guo, 19, gained an online following by documenting his trip around the world, which lasted well over 100 days and had already taken him to six continents prior to the Antarctic voyage, according to his website and social media posts.",
      "Guo said he hoped to become the first pilot to complete a solo flight across all seven continents in a small Cessna, a feat that simultaneously aims to raise $1 million for cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. On his site, the teen cites his cousin's 2021 cancer diagnosis as his source of inspiration.",
      "Guo's latest Instagram posts chronicled part of his path over southeastern Asia. But authorities in South America say he went on to traverse the Pacific Ocean, ending up in Chile before making his way toward Antarctica.",
      "According to Cristian Cristoso Rifo, the regional prosecutor of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica, Guo departed from the airport in the city of Punta Arenas, near the southernmost point of Chile, and proceeded to conduct an unauthorized flight to King George Island. Located off the Atlantic coast, the island is claimed by Chile as part of its Atlantic territory.",
      "The young pilot landed his plane at the island's Teniente R. Marsh Airport, where he was detained, Cristoso said in a video statement shared to social media on Monday. The prosecutor's office charged Guo for violating two articles of the Chilean Aeronautical Code, including one that calls for either short-term imprisonment or a fine brought down on anyone who lands in Chilean territory without legitimate authorization. Guo allegedly submitted a flight plan that indicated his plans to fly over Punta Arenas, but not farther than that, according to Cristoso.",
      "The prosecutor said that in addition to his alleged breaches of the aeronautical code, Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes taken to get there. His unauthorized flight also posed safety risks for air traffic to the frozen continent, Cristoso added.",

      "The semisubmersible vessel was not carrying drugs, but the Colombian navy and Western security sources based in the region told AFP they believed it was a trial run by a cocaine trafficking cartel.",
      "\"It was being tested and was empty,\" a naval spokeswoman confirmed to AFP.",
      "Manned semisubmersibles built in clandestine jungle shipyards have been used for decades to ferry cocaine north from Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine producer, to Central America or Mexico.",
      "But in recent years, they have been sailing much farther afield, crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "The latest find, announced by Admiral Juan Ricardo Rozo at a press conference, is the first reported discovery in South American waters of a drone narco sub. In May 2024, Italian police announced the seizure of a small remote-controlled sub likely intended to transport drugs as part of an international drug trafficking network.",
      "The Colombian navy said the drone semisubmersible was owned by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug trafficking group and had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine.",
      "The Gulf Clan is one of several cartels recently\u00a0designated\u00a0as foreign terrorist groups by the United States.The group's \"primary source of income is from cocaine trafficking, which it uses to fund its paramilitary activities,\" according to the\u00a0U.S. State Department.",

      "Shuldiner also highlighted the challenge of assembling crews to sail makeshift subs described as floating \"coffins.\" The journey can be deadly: In 2023, a\u00a0\"narco sub\" with two dead bodies\u00a0and nearly three tons of cocaine aboard was seized off the coast of Colombia.",
      "A near record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted in the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024, according to the report.",

      "The virus has been found in species of flying foxes and insect-eating microbats, NSW Health said.",
      "The species of bat involved in the latest fatality has not been identified.",
      "\"Australian bat lyssavirus is very closely related to rabies and will cause death in susceptible people if they become infected and are not treated quickly,\" said James Gilkerson, infectious diseases expert at the University of Melbourne.",
      "The virus was first identified in May 1996 by scientists at the national science agency CSIRO, who examined brain tissue from a flying fox that had been showing \"nervous signs\" in New South Wales.",
      "Later that year, a bat handler in Queensland became ill.",
      "\"The initial numbness and weakness suffered in her arm progressed to coma and death,\" the science agency said in an online document on the virus.",
      "\"Two further cases in Queensland \u2014 a woman in 1998 and an eight year old boy in 2013 \u2014 resulted in death after being bitten or scratched by a bat,\" it said.",

      "Infected bats can transmit the virus to people, other bats and other mammals.",

      "The Dalai Lama's succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing Wednesday said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\"",
      "Mao said the process must \"follow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\"",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\"In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \"unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"",
      "\"We not only strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\" he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama's reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent's death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

    "summary": "Trump says Israel has agreed to conditions for a Gaza ceasefire and he's urging Hamas to back it, but neither side has committed to anything yet.",
    "story": [
      "It appeared on Wednesday that President Trump likely still has some deal-making to do before he can claim to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to end the devastating war in Gaza. Mr. Trump said in a Tuesday evening social media post that Israel had \"agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\" a 60-day ceasefire, and he called on Hamas to accept the deal, warning the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that \"it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Israeli sources told CBS News on Wednesday that while there was strong backing in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet for the terms in the proposal, Israel was not committing to it yet, stressing that the government had voiced its backing to U.S. officials for a proposed framework for a ceasefire deal, not a final agreement.",
      "In a statement, Hamas credited mediators Qatar and Egypt for having \"exerted intensive efforts to bridge the gap between the parties and reach a framework agreement that would pave the way for a serious round of negotiations.\"",
      "\"We are approaching this with a high sense of responsibility and are conducting national consultations to discuss the proposals presented by the mediators,\" Hamas said, reiterating its long-standing calls for a truce that brings the war to an end, sees Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza, \"and urgently delivers relief to our people in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't offer any details of the proposed deal in his post on Tuesday evening, but he said that Qatar and Egypt \u2014 which have been key partners to the U.S. as it attempts to broker an agreement to end the nearly two-year war \u2014 would \"deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, in a post on social media Wednesday, said there was \"a great majority in the government and also among the people for a framework to release hostages. If there is an opportunity to do so \u2014 we must not miss it!\"",
      "But that claim of cohesion may belie a potentially significant hurdle for Netanyahu as he prepares to head to Washington this weekend to meet with Mr. Trump, who's made it clear he wants to see a deal to end the war within days.",
      "Numerous Israeli media outlets reported Wednesday that one of the most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, had called on far-right nationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to join him in blocking the government's approval of the ceasefire deal.",
      "Neither Smotrich nor Ben-Gvir confirmed any discussion about blocking the agreement, but in a short post on social media, Ben-Gvir said the war in Gaza should not end \"a moment before defeating Hamas.\" Both men have been vocal in rejecting peace deals with Hamas, insisting that the group must be completely destroyed, not negotiated with.",
      "Yair Golan, leader of the Israeli opposition Democrats party, accused Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in a social media post of \"leading a bloc to prevent the return of the hostages.\" He said they \"do not deserve to sit around the government table. And whoever continues to allow them to sit there does not deserve to lead Israel for even one more day.\"",
      "While the real prospects of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a ceasefire in the short time frame that Mr. Trump is hoping for remained unclear, even the suggestion that peace could be looming may raise hopes for Gazans who risk their lives every day just to line up lining up for food.",
      "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation responds to criticism",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health says at least 640 civilians have been shot to death in recent weeks trying to access desperately needed humanitarian supplies, including more than 400 at distribution sites run by the heavily criticized U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Since it began operating in the war-torn enclave on May 26, GHF has faced near daily claims of aid-seekers being killed by Israeli forces as they try to reach its four hubs in Gaza.",
      "Earlier this week, more than 170 humanitarian groups called for the opaquely run organization \u2014   which has never revealed its funding or management structure \u2014   to be disbanded and all aid efforts in Gaza to be reorganized under the long-established United Nations-led system. Those international humanitarian efforts have been largely blocked by Israel since March.",
      "The Israeli military says it works with the GHF to enable aid distribution without the risk of food and other goods being stolen by Hamas.",
      "The Trump administration has backed that reasoning and refused to support other means of food dispersal in Gaza, instead calling on other nations and institutions to work with the GHF, which replaced some 400 international aid distribution points in the Palestinian territory with just four of its hubs. Those hubs are run by armed U.S. private security contractors, and the Israeli military controls access to them.",
      "All established humanitarian agencies have refused to work with the GHF, saying it forces Palestinians to dislocate and trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles, but the Trump administration announced late last week its first public support for the group: $30 million in funding.",
      "The State Department wouldn't say, when that funding was announced, if the funds had already been transferred to GHF, or which U.S. government account they would come from.",
      "The GHF has declined to respond to multiple questions from CBS News about its connections with the U.S. and Israeli governments and its funding, and it had, until this week, also declined to be interviewed by CBS News about its operations. On Tuesday, however, the GHF's director, American evangelical reverend Johnnie Moore, a former adviser to President Trump on religious matters, agreed to an interview via Zoom.",
      "Our first question was about the reports CBS News has received since GHF began its operations, directly from doctors and eyewitnesses, that Israeli soldiers have repeatedly opened fire on unarmed civilians trying to reach its aid hubs.",
      "\"I do not want to diminish these reports, but we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites,\" Moore told CBS News.",
      "Asked how many more people would die before GHF changed the way it operates, Moore called the framing of the question \"inappropriate,\" and said the group's \"whole reason for existing is to give food to these people so they can live.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014   and those of the White House \u2014   for the United Nations and its various humanitarian agencies to join GHF's efforts in Gaza.",
      "\"We've said again and again to the U.N., to the WFP (World Food Program), join us in this effort,\" Moore said, before asking CBS News' correspondent, \"with respect, why don't you join us? I'm asking you to help us run the operation if you think there is a better way to do this.\"",
      "Asked how GHF has been able to verify who exactly receives the aid it provides on the ground \u2014   which Moore has stressed does not reach Hamas \u2014 the reverend responded with a question: \"Do you have anything positive to say about what we are doing?\"",
      "\"Do you think it is acceptable that people die every day trying to access aid? Is there not a better way to do this?\" CBS News asked again.",
      "\"We have made a decision that it is worth working in a war zone,\" Moore said, \"as deadly as it is, because Gazans deserve food.\"",
      "Moore would not respond to questions about how GHF operates or who funds the organization, beside the $30 million contribution announced this week by the Trump administration.",

      "Coco Gauff became just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open, eliminated 7-6 (3), 6-1 by unseeded Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine on Tuesday night.",
      "The No. 2-ranked Gauff made mistake after mistake at No. 1 Court, finishing with just six winners and a total of 29 unforced errors that included nine double-faults.",
      "\"Dayana started off playing strong,\" Gauff said. \"I couldn't find my footing out there today.\"",
      "She joined another highly seeded American, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, in bowing out on Day 2 of the tournament. In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",
      "The transition from clay to grass has proven tough for most players, and the last woman to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season was Serena Williams a decade ago.",
      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",
      "\"I love playing on grass. I feel that this year we are kind of friends,\" Yastremska said with a laugh. \"I hope the road will continue for me here.\"",

      "\"The atmosphere of that small apartment building \u2014 which, naturally, was centered around a swimming pool \u2014 not only encouraged sexual adventures but facilitated them; several of Clint\u2019s friends from Oakland, Seattle, and Fort Ord moved into the place or similar places nearby, meaning that there were always apartments readily available for a quick tryst \u2014 and buddies willing to help him cover his tracks.\"",
      "According to Levy, Eastwood was always upfront about his behavior and allegedly had an \"understanding\" with Johnson.",
      "\"It wasn\u2019t entirely evident, though, that he needed such help. As a friend put it, \u2018Clint goes where he wants, does what he wants \u2014 goes to dinner with a girl if he wants. Maggie doesn\u2019t say a thing. Clint is the undisputed boss.'

      "Two months after the trial kicked off, and nearly 14 hours into deliberations, jurors told Judge Arun Subramanian that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision on a racketeering charge.",
      "The prosecution called more than 30 witnesses to the stand throughout seven weeks of testimony, while Diddy's defense team rested without calling any witnesses on their behalf \u2014 a move considered \"high stakes poker\" by former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Trey Gowdy.",

      "Diddy's defense played \"high stakes poker\" by not calling witnesses to the stand, experts say. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Usually, when defense does not call witnesses, that defendant is called an inmate,\" Gowdy explained. \"I've said that my entire career. That's a fancy way of calling someone an inmate. You gotta give the jury a reason for reasonable doubt and to simply say the prosecution hasn\u2019t met its burden \u2026 most jurors don\u2019t really understand what that burden is.\"",
      "He added, \"Gotta give the jury a reason for doubt\u00a0and if you don't put up a very significant defense, all you do is cross-examine government witnesses, then you're going to be an inmate.\"",
      "DIDDY DEFENSE CLAIMS HE WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED, WHILE PROSECUTION SAYS RAPPER THOUGHT HE WAS 'UNTOUCHABLE'",
      "Diddy told the court last week that it was his decision not to testify in his sex crimes case. The judge asked if Diddy understood he had the right to testify or not testify, and if he had discussed his rights with his attorney. Diddy responded, \"Yes, thoroughly,\" before admitting it was \"solely my decision\" to not testify in his sex crimes trial.",
      "Jurors began deliberating on Monday, June 30, and of the five counts, could not agree on a verdict for the racketeering charge, one of the most serious counts against the disgraced music mogul. A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence. The transportation to engage in prostitution charge could carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion may carry a 20-year sentence.",
      "Jurors were unable to reach a verdict Tuesday on all five counts in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"It\u2019s very complicated \u2014 most lawyers cannot explain RICO, so to expect 12 people, average citizen jurors to understand a criminal enterprise, predicate acts \u2026 it\u2019s just a lot to ask,\" Gowdy said. \"There\u2019s a reason to charge it even if you don\u2019t win. It opens evidentiary doors that might be closed, so lots of times prosecutors will charge something because it enables you to get extra evidence before a jury even though you don't really expect to get a guilty verdict on that count.\"",

      "Criminal defense attorney John W. Day, owner of the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based law practice John Day Law, told Fox News Digital that jurors may have had a difficult time comprehending the RICO charge.",
      "\"Was Diddy's high-flying and maybe disturbing lifestyle just that, or can you really pick out a criminal enterprise that is the equivalent of an organized crime family?\" Day said. \"But tomorrow morning the judge will be hoping that after a night of thinking about it, the jurors will have second thoughts about a split verdict on RICO \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 and come back with a unanimous verdict on that most serious charge.\"",

      "\"So what happens is now they're forced to go back in there, and there's probably going to be a lot of frustration back there, more fighting back and forth,\" Becker said. \"My understanding is that the jurors' verbiage was something to the effect of that they're at a point where there's unpersuadable opinions on both sides. So clearly some of the jurors thinking, 'Well, obviously he's guilty.'\"",

      "\"There\u2019s a wide range of breads \u2014 from those that can negatively impact your health to options that offer potential health benefits,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The first ingredient is what makes up the majority of the bread, so this should be a whole grain.\"",
      "Breads made from refined flours, such as white bread, can cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar, increasing the risk of weight gain and type 2 diabetes over time, the dietitian warned.",
      "Instead, she recommends opting for whole-grain and high-fiber breads that break down more slowly, helping to stabilize blood sugar and improve long-term glycemic control.",
      "When choosing a bread, it\u2019s important to read labels carefully and assess the ingredient list, Palinski-Wade advised.",

      "Avoiding the sugar spike",
      "Dr. Jason Fung, a Toronto-based physician who is also an expert in intermittent fasting, agreed that bread\u2019s effect on health hinges not only on its carbohydrate content, but also on how quickly the starches are absorbed into the bloodstream.",

      "\"When choosing bread with fewer preservatives and simpler ingredients, consumers need to be aware that the bread will not last as long, and may need to be frozen and toasted to eventually make use of an entire loaf.\" (iStock)",
      "\"This is because the flour is very refined \u2014 removing fiber, fats, proteins and bran, which all slow absorption \u2014 and is also very finely machine ground. This fine grind creates white flour, which is a dust that is quickly absorbed by intestinal cells.\"",
      "The texturizers and emulsifiers in commercial white breads \u2014 which are added to make them softer and easier to eat \u2014 also cause them to be more quickly digested and absorbed, Fung noted.",
      "\"You can see the effect of this on the glycemic index, which measures how quickly bread spikes your glucose,\" he said.",
      "The GI is a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest glucose spikes. White bread has a very high GI of 73, Fung said, while machine-ground whole wheat is not much better, at 70.",

      "There has been little change in U.S. energy consumption over the past decade. Increased efforts to make energy use more efficient have kept levels low. But over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. Some estimates show the facilities are expected to require as much energy in 2030 as the entire country of Japan does today.",
      "\"Every investor is lining up to invest in the next AI breakthrough. But when it comes to energy, there is a challenge in terms of permitting, the reality of construction timelines for new power plants and new grid capabilities,\" said senior advisor with the Wadhwani A.I. center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"All of this could slow down A.I. just as the research and development is preparing for takeoff.\"",
      "The demand from tech firms comes amid skepticism from consumers. According to a Fox News Poll on how voters felt about A.I. in society, 43% saw it as a good thing, while 47% thought it was a bad thing.",
      "\"I think it's natural that people will always have, call it a mixture of hopes and anxieties about what a new technology, including any new technology and especially AI may bring,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. \"The truth is we all rely on AI already, even if we don't think about it.\"",

      "While positive views have increased faster than negative views, according to polling from 2023, subgroups surveyed expressed opinions all over the board. Most rural voters, White voters, women and those over the age of 45 viewed A.I. as a bad thing. Urban voters, non-White voters, men and those younger than 45 viewed the technology as good. Among major political parties, registered Republicans were most optimistic about A.I. but no party\u2019s approval was above 50%.",
      "Despite the somewhat negative sentiment of most voters, tech companies are powering on.",
      "\"A.I. relies on a lot of what we call compute. A lot of chips that do a lot of calculations and a lot of data that is accessed and is stored. So all of that requires more electricity.

Constellation and Microsoft plan to restart the reactor as early as 2027 at what is now called Crane Energy Center. It will add more than 800 megawatts of energy. That\u2019s enough to power more than 800,000 homes. Nuclear power has the highest energy efficiency rate, yet energy producers say the U.S. should remain diversified.",

      "Microsoft is working to add the amount of power back to the grid that the company\u2019s data centers will use from the regional transmission system.",
      "\"Our philosophy as a company is that we will invest to bring onto the electric grid as much or more power than we will consume,\" Smith said. \"We will do that in a way that ensures that none of the neighbors are going to see rise in their electricity rates.\"",

      "At the center of the controversy is the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), a company jointly owned by several of the largest U.S. airlines, including Delta, American Airlines and United. ARC\u2019s core business includes managing ticket settlements between airlines and travel agencies. However, under a lesser-known initiative called the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), ARC collects and monetizes vast amounts of data from domestic flight bookings. This includes names, complete itineraries and payment details.",

      "The data is shared without travelers' knowledge or consent, and ARC reportedly requested that the agency keep its identity confidential unless legally required to disclose it.",

Importantly, it does not include data from tickets purchased directly through airline websites, focusing instead on bookings made via travel agencies, such as Expedia.",

      "If you want to take back control of your personal information, here are six smart steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure to data brokers.",
      "1. Book flights directly on airline websites:\u00a0Whenever you can, avoid using third-party travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz or travel agencies. These platforms are the main sources of the data collected by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) through its Travel Intelligence Program. When you book directly on an airline\u2019s official website or mobile app, your data is far less likely to be shared with ARC or sold to government agencies. While it might be tempting to look for deals on aggregator sites, once you find a fare you like, try to book it directly through the airline.",
      "2. Use virtual or disposable credit cards:\u00a0The ARC system allows queries by credit card number, which means your travel activity can be tracked even if your name is not directly searched. To protect yourself, consider using a virtual credit card or a disposable card number for flight bookings. These are often available through banking apps or fintech services like Revolut, Privacy.com or certain American Express accounts. Virtual cards are tied to your main account but generate a temporary number that can only be used once or at a specific merchant. This makes it much harder for brokers to link future bookings to you.",
      "3. Share the bare minimum when booking:\u00a0Be cautious about the personal information you enter during the booking process. Unless it is legally required, avoid adding unnecessary details like your frequent flyer number, passport data for domestic flights or secondary phone numbers. You can also create a separate email address specifically for travel bookings to reduce the risk of cross-linking data with your other online accounts. When it comes to loyalty programs, consider opting out or using a separate identity if you are concerned about data being shared across companies.",
      "4. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.

Switch to browsers like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo, which block ads and data collectors by default. Set up a separate, secure alias email address for booking travel using services. This limits how easily brokers can link your travel data to your online identity. See my review of the best secure and private email services by\u00a0visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail",

Identity theft companies can assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. They can also monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.",

      "Google DeepMind has introduced a powerful on-device version of its Gemini Robotics AI.",
      "This new system allows robots to complete complex tasks without relying on a cloud connection. Known as Gemini Robotics On-Device, the model brings Gemini's advanced reasoning and control capabilities directly into physical robots. It is designed for fast, reliable performance in places with poor or no internet connectivity, making it ideal for real-world, latency-sensitive environments.",

It can understand natural language, perform fine motor tasks and generalize from very little data, all without requiring an internet connection. According to Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, the system is \"small and efficient enough\" to operate directly onboard. Developers can use the model in situations where connectivity is limited, without sacrificing intelligence or flexibility.",

The system delivers faster response times and fewer points of failure, opening up new possibilities for robot deployment in real-world settings.",
      "Safety requires developer input",
      "The on-device model does not include built-in semantic safety features. Google recommends that developers build safety systems into their robots using tools like the Gemini Live API and trusted low-level controllers. The company is limiting access to select developers to better study safety risks and real-world applications. While the hybrid model still offers more overall power, this version holds its own for most common use cases and helps push robotics closer to everyday deployment.",

      "2. Double-check every message: If something feels off, don\u2019t click anything. Instead, visit Amazon.com or open the app to check your order history and account messages. If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats. This extra layer of security helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe. A few quick habits can go a long way in keeping your personal information secure.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:00:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "What is Meta AI, and what does the \"Discover\" tab do?",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. Users can chat casually or deep dive into personal topics, from relationship questions to financial concerns or health issues.",
      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast. These aren't isolated incidents, and as more people use AI for personal support, the stakes will only get higher.",

      "Even casual users should take a moment to review their settings and chat history to make sure personal details aren\u2019t being shared without their knowledge.",
      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "Bad actors constantly seek every bit of personal information they can get, from your phone number to your government ID. Now, a new threat targets both Android and iPhone users: SparkKitty, a powerful mobile malware strain that scans private photos to steal cryptocurrency recovery phrases and other sensitive data.",

      "A new threat targets both Android and iPhone users. (Apple)",
      "What is SparkKitty mobile malware",
      "Researchers at cybersecurity firm Kaspersky recently identified SparkKitty. This malware appears to succeed SparkCat, a campaign first reported earlier this year that used optical character recognition (OCR) to extract sensitive data from images, including crypto recovery phrases.",
      "SparkKitty goes even further than SparkCat. According to Kaspersky, SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. This tactic exposes not just wallet data but also any personal or sensitive photos stored on the device. While the main target seems to be crypto seed phrases, criminals could use other images for extortion or malicious purposes.",
      "Kaspersky researchers report that SparkKitty has operated since at least February 2024. Attackers distributed it through both official and unofficial channels, including Google Play and the Apple App Store.",
      "SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kaspersky found SparkKitty embedded in several apps, including one called \u5e01coin on iOS and another called SOEX on Android. Both apps are no longer available in their respective stores. SOEX, a messaging app with cryptocurrency-related features, reached more than 10,000 downloads from the Google Play Store before its removal.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles, often disguised as legitimate components. Once installed, SparkKitty uses a method native to Apple\u2019s Objective-C programming language to run as soon as the app launches. It checks the app\u2019s internal configuration files to decide whether to execute, then quietly starts monitoring the user\u2019s photo library.",
      "On Android, SparkKitty hides in apps written in Java or Kotlin and sometimes uses malicious Xposed or LSPosed modules. It activates when the app launches or after a specific screen opens. The malware then decrypts a configuration file from a remote server and begins uploading images, device metadata, and identifiers.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles. (Apple)",
      "Unlike traditional spyware, SparkKitty focuses on photos, especially those containing cryptocurrency recovery phrases, wallet screenshots, IDs, or sensitive documents. Instead of just monitoring activity, SparkKitty uploads images in bulk. This approach makes it easy for criminals to sift through and extract valuable personal data.",
      "1) Stick to trusted developers:\u00a0Avoid downloading obscure apps, especially if they have few reviews or downloads. Always check the developer's name and history before installing anything.",
      "2) Review app permissions:\u00a0Be cautious of apps that request access to your photos, messages, or files without a clear reason. If something feels off, deny the permission or uninstall the app.",
      "3) Keep your device updated:\u00a0Install system and security updates as soon as they are available. These updates often patch vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "4) Use mobile security software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious software is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Both Apple and Google removed the identified apps after being alerted, but questions remain about how SparkKitty bypassed their app review processes in the first place. As app stores grow, both in volume and complexity, the tools used to screen them will need to evolve at the same pace. Otherwise, incidents like this one will continue to slip through the cracks.",

      "Thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. \"Cyberguy\" Kurt Knutsson explains.",
      "When someone loses the ability to speak because of a neurological condition like ALS, the impact goes far beyond words. It touches every part of daily life, from sharing a joke with family to simply asking for help. Now, thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. This technology isn't just about converting thoughts into text. Instead, it translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "There's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. (UC Davis)",
      "Real-time speech through brain signals",
      "The heart of this system is four microelectrode arrays, surgically implanted in the part of the brain responsible for producing speech. These tiny devices pick up the neural activity that happens when someone tries to speak. The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance.

They video-called me on FB Messenger, and it showed a moving picture of them smiling, but the connection was 'bad' and got 'lost.'\u00a0 I asked them to tell me something about myself, and they sent me the name of my son (who has a different last name). Satisfied, I agreed to help.\u00a0They asked that I send them a recovery code which I did. In a flash, they changed the emails (which one was newly fake) and my password, which essentially locked the real me out.",

Said someone had purchased $17,000 in bitcoins. If I allowed them to send me one dollar they could verify something. I realized it was a scam and hung up.",
      "\"I've since changed my email address and passwords for important accounts. Also have created a new FB account. However, I was admin for 3 FB groups, and the hacker got into them.

It will have trained professionals who understand local threats. Their experts can provide you with personalized guidance for your situation. They also offer resources and training to help prevent future cybersecurity incidents.",
      "Protecting your online identity",
      "Protecting your online identity is crucial in today's digital landscape, especially if you created another Facebook account because the old one was unrecoverable. There's no telling if cybercriminals will try to gain unauthorized access to those as well.",

      "Shanghai is no stranger to jaw-dropping feats of engineering.",
      "In the latest example, a Shanghai historic building moved by robots is capturing global attention. The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",
      "This ambitious project is powered by an army of 432 small robots that are moving the massive structure about 33 feet each day to make way for a new underground development. Let's dive into how this is happening, why it matters and what it means for the future of urban preservation.",

      "Over 400 small robots are moving the complex in Huayang. (Shanghai Government)",
      "What makes the Shanghai historic building moved by robots so special?",
      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design. Zhangyuan itself is over 140 years old and is one of Shanghai's largest and best-preserved shikumen neighborhoods.",

      "DELIVERY ROBOT AUTONOMOUSLY LIFTS AND TRANSPORTS HEAVY CARGO",
      "Why is a Shanghai historic building being moved by robots?",
      "The relocation is not just for show. The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines. By preserving the historic Huayanli complex above ground while adding modern infrastructure below, Shanghai is finding a smart balance between honoring its heritage and embracing progress.",

      "The challenges: Tight spaces and dense history",
      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

One term you might be familiar with is software as a service (SaaS), a model by which software is accessed online through a subscription rather than installed on individual machines.",
      "In healthcare, SaaS providers are now a common part of the ecosystem. But, recently, many of them have made headlines for the wrong reasons.",
      "Several data breaches have been traced back to vulnerabilities at these third-party service providers. The latest incident comes from one such firm, which has now confirmed that hackers stole the health information of over 5 million people in the United States during a cyberattack in January.",

      "Episource, a big name in healthcare data analytics and coding services, has\u00a0confirmed a major cybersecurity incident (via\u00a0Bleeping Computer). The breach involved sensitive health information belonging to over 5 million people in the United States. The company first noticed suspicious system activity Feb. 6, 2025, but the actual compromise began ten days earlier.",
      "An internal investigation revealed that hackers accessed and copied private data between Jan. 27 and Feb. 6. The company insists that no financial information was taken, but the stolen records do include names, contact details, Social Security numbers, Medicaid IDs and full medical histories.",
      "Episource claims there\u2019s no evidence the information has been misused, but because they haven\u2019t seen the fallout yet doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening. Once data like this is out, it spreads fast, and the consequences don\u2019t wait for official confirmation.",

      "Why healthcare SaaS is a growing target",
      "The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",
      "Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from healthcare data breach",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "There\u2019s a new PayPal phishing scam making the rounds, and it\u2019s so convincing that even security-conscious users are getting caught in it. Unlike typical scams riddled with typos and fake domains, this one uses PayPal\u2019s own email system to send you an alert that looks 100% real.",

They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",

      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6. Use a personal data removal service: Since phishing scams like the recent PayPal scam often target personal information that scammers gather from data brokers and people search sites, using a reputable data removal service can help reduce your exposure.

      "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order lifting most U.S. sanctions on Syria, in a move experts say reflects growing recognition inside the administration that Syria, long a battleground for Iranian influence and Islamist terror, may now offer the U.S. a rare opportunity to reclaim regional leverage, counter enemies, and support allies like Israel and Jordan.",
      "At a White House press briefing Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"This is another promise made and promise kept by this president,\" she said, referring to Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Syria\u2019s new transitional leader Ahmed al-Sharaa during a trip to Saudi Arabia. \"He\u2019s committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors.\"",
      "\"The sanctions did their job,\" David Schenker, former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs and now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"They were crippling by and large.

      "Javed Ali, former senior official at the National Security Council and professor at the University of Michigan, told Fox News Digital, \"It\u2019s a strategic calculation. A Syria that no longer hosts Iranian proxies, cooperates on counterterrorism, and integrates with Arab neighbors serves U.S. interests on every front.\"",
      "According to Schenker, Syria has taken steps the U.S. has long demanded: allowing inspections by the IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, sharing intelligence on ISIS, and cooperating with American liaison officers on counterterrorism. \"These groups have declared al-Sharaa an infidel. They themselves are being attacked by ISIS,\" he noted.",

      "For the U.S., the stakes extend far beyond sanctions relief. Schenker said a stable Syria focused on education and social services, rather than military buildup, would be far less fertile ground for ISIS or Iranian influence.",
      "Ali described the current moment as part of a broader Trump strategy: \"Now with Assad gone, it\u2019s another blow to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This creates an opportunity to coalesce the Sunni Arab states \u2013 either around the Abraham Accords or a growing anti-Iran coalition.\"",
      "The U.S. military still maintains a small but critical footprint in Syria \u2013 approximately 1,000 troops across three to four bases in the northeast \u2013 providing vital intelligence and rapid strike capability. \"That footprint has been one of our most important counterterrorism outposts,\" Ali said. \"We\u2019ve seen multiple targeted operations this year alone.\"",

      "He said, however, that deeper U.S.-Syrian cooperation could bring new complications. \"There\u2019s always a risk that as ties deepen, either the U.S. could reduce its presence \u2013 or al-Sharaa might ask us to scale back,\" Ali said. \"That could impact our ability to monitor jihadist activity or manage the tens of thousands of ISIS detainees still in camps guarded by SDF forces.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the diplomatic implications of Trump\u2019s move are drawing global attention. Syria\u2019s new leadership has publicly distanced itself from Iran, reportedly blocked Hezbollah weapon shipments, and dismantled multiple Iranian military posts across the country.",
      "\"The president is genuinely focused on expanding the Abraham Accords,\" said Schenker. \"He sees Syria as the next possible candidate.\"",
      "NSC spokesman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors. The President is empowering Syria\u2019s success by lifting sanctions on export controls while maintaining sanctions on terrorists and all other potential threats to the United States. The President made a promise to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting sanctions, and this President keeps his promises.\"",
      "A masked Islamic State terrorist holds the ISIS flag in 2015. (Pictures from History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Still, normalization with Israel remains politically fraught. Syria remains officially at war with the Jewish state, and while Sharaa has hinted at accepting the pre-1974 ceasefire lines, jihadist factions and Islamist groups within Syria remain staunchly opposed. \"There have already been reported assassination attempts on Sharaa,\" Schenker said. \"It\u2019s going to get harder if he moves from non-belligerency to full normalization.\"",
      "Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"Syria has always been an open wound in the center of the region \u2013 an engine of instability\u2026 But if it stabilizes now, it unlocks a path for broader regional integration. It connects Israel and Jordan to a more secure arc and reduces the need for heavy U.S. military involvement.\"",

      "Ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism laid out his succession plans in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in the town of Dharamshala, India. Originally named Tenzin Gyatso, he became what is traditionally known as the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959.",

      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China. After fleeing Tibet, the current Dalai Lama helped establish a democratic Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala, while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",

Ostovar describes how its legitimacy evolved over time, initially drawn from the overthrow of the Shah, then the Iran-Iraq War, and later through the manufactured narrative of an eternal struggle with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Director of FDD's Iran Program Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital the IRGC\u2019s origin reflects a deep mistrust of Iran\u2019s traditional military, which had remained loyal to the Shah.",
      "\"The IRGC were created through efforts to collect pro-regime armed gangs called Komitehs. They enforced revolutionary edicts and developed a parallel and ideological military force due to clerical skepticism in the national army,\" he explained.",
      "People move past a large banner featuring portraits of slain leaders from Iran-aligned armed groups, including Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, in central Tehran, Iran, on May 1, 2025.\u00a0 (MOHAMMADALI NAJIB/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"The IRGC are tasked with preserving and defending the revolution in Iran,\" Taleblu said. \"That\u2019s one reason why the 1979 Islamic Revolution has not been tamed, nor has the regime\u2019s extremism lost any luster. If anything, terrorism and hostage-taking have continued.\"",
      "\"They created a boogeyman in the U.S. and Israel,\" Ostovar added. \"But today, that ideology no longer resonates with most Iranians. The majority want better relations with the West and are tired of the regime\u2019s isolationist stance.\"",
      "Today, the IRGC is deeply intertwined with the clerical elite. \"The IRGC and the clerical elite are partners in power, treating Iran as a springboard to export their revolution,\" Taleblu noted.",
      "EXILED IRANIAN PRINCE TELLS TRUMP HE CAN BE 'ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT PEACEMAKERS' AMID TALK OF REGIME CHANGE",
      "Over the past year, Iran has suffered a series of strategic defeats: Hezbollah has been degraded in Lebanon, Hamas crippled in Gaza, Syria effectively lost, and Iranian military infrastructure \u2014 including nuclear and missile sites \u2014 destroyed in many cases by U.S. and Israeli strikes. Ostovar says these losses have decimated the IRGC\u2019s regional footprint and forced the regime to reevaluate its strategy.",
      "\"They can try to rebuild everything \u2014 but that would take too long and be too difficult,\" he said. \"More likely, we\u2019ll see them repress harder at home and lean on China and Russia to rebuild conventional military capabilities like air defense and advanced jets.\"",
      "Members of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. A large part of its work is to covertly operate outside of Iran. (Reuters)",
      "Internally, the IRGC\u2019s economic empire is also under growing strain. Sanctions, cyberattacks, and battlefield losses have made operations far more difficult. Ostovar said that foreign banks avoid any connection with Iran out of fear they may inadvertently deal with IRGC-linked entities, forcing the group to operate through front companies abroad. \"They\u2019ve lost a lot, and now they\u2019ll have to redirect their limited resources to rebuild. That\u2019s going to stretch them even thinner.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "Despite these pressures, both Ostovar and Taleblu agree that the IRGC is unlikely to turn against the regime. \"Much like the regime elite, the IRGC is at a crossroads,\" Taleblu said. \"They have lost much of their strategic brain trust, but are likely to remain loyal for a combination of ideological and material reasons \u2014 so long as the status quo doesn\u2019t change.\"",
      "Looking ahead, Iran may shift focus inward, relying more on domestic repression than on external terror. \"They can\u2019t get weapons into Gaza. They\u2019ve lost access to Lebanon. They may still attempt terrorism, but they\u2019ve failed repeatedly \u2014 especially against Israeli targets,\" Ostovar said. \"In contrast, repressing their own people is something they can do easily.\"",
      "He warns that Iran could become \"more insular, more autocratic \u2014 more like North Korea than what it is today.\" While regime collapse is always a possibility, Ostovar believes autocracies are often resilient. \"Look at Venezuela or Cuba \u2014 they\u2019ve run their countries into the ground but still hold on to power.\"",
      "In this photo released by the Iranian Red Crescent Society rescuers work at the scene of an explosion after an Israeli strike in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 13, 2025. (Iranian Red Crescent Society via AP)",
      "Ostovar thinks change \u2014 and not for the better \u2014 could come via generational shift. \"The IRGC\u2019s younger cadre is less religious but no less hardline,\" he said. \"They may not care about hijabs, but they\u2019ve spent the last two decades fighting the U.S. and Israel in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. That\u2019s the war they know.\"",
      "Some reformist elements within the regime envision a different path \u2014 one focused on normalization and growth. \"They want to preserve the regime not by fighting the world, but by opening up to it,\" Ostovar said. \"They look more to Vietnam or China as models.\"",

      "Taleblu warned that despite recent setbacks, the IRGC\u2019s grip remains strong. \"Right now, the Guards have power without accountability, wielding political, economic, and military influence in Iranian policy.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is expected Friday to sign into law his sprawling domestic policy bill, which includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d the new legislation will extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts and make up for them in part by slashing federal Medicaid funding, introducing copays for some services and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 implementing nationwide Medicaid work requirements. The final version of the bill didn\u2019t include an estimate of coverage losses; an earlier Congressional Budget Office report projected that about 11 million people could lose their health coverage and become uninsured by 2034 because of the program cuts.",
      "Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, which usually mandate that applicants meet certain criteria, such as low income, disability or caregiving status.",
      "Only two states have implemented Medicaid work requirements: Arkansas in 2018 and Georgia in 2023. Georgia\u2019s program, called Pathways to Coverage, remains in effect.",
      "Over the 10 months Arkansas\u2019 work requirement was in place, more than 18,000 people in the state lost Medicaid coverage. Georgia hasn\u2019t done a good job keeping track of how many have lost coverage, but enrollment remains low, said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.",
      "When people lose Medicaid coverage, they view it as \u201csort of a slap in the face,\u201d Ku said.",
      "\u201cWhen your income is down, when you\u2019re unemployed, that\u2019s when you lose everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re most in need. That\u2019s when you lose your food assistance, that\u2019s when you lose your health insurance coverage.\u201d",
      "Kendall Rogers, 40, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, is looking for a job after he lost his Medicaid coverage this year because of the state\u2019s work requirements, according to his mom, Trudy Rogers, 59.",
      "The change means Trudy now has to take care of herself for long parts of the day. She has fibromyalgia and nerve problems in her back that make it difficult for her to get around.",
      "Kendall was caring for her nearly full time, Trudy said, but Georgia\u2019s work requirements don\u2019t offer exemptions for caregivers for older adults.",
      "She called the new requirements \u201can insult not only to him, but to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause now he\u2019s forced to go out and look for work, and I need him to stay around the house,\u201d she said.",
      "Covered in red tape",
      "To justify the cuts, Republicans have argued that they\u2019re not taking Medicaid from those who are rightfully entitled to it \u2014 such as, they say, single mothers or the disabled \u2014 but from \u201cyoung, able-bodied men\u201d who they say are abusing the system.",
      "\u201cIf you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money, and you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in April.",
      "But as seen in Georgia and Arkansas, that\u2019s not who is largely affected.",
      "Cynthia Gibson, director of the Georgia Legal Services Program\u2019s Health Law Unit, which helps appeal Medicaid denials, said many people in the state lose coverage not because they aren\u2019t working, but because they aren\u2019t aware of the new rules or face administrative issues like missed paperwork or not having received notices. Others, like Kendall Rogers, are caring for family members but don\u2019t qualify for exemptions.",
      "Likewise, in Arkansas, only 3% or 4% of the people on Medicaid in 2018 weren\u2019t working and didn\u2019t qualify for the exemptions under the state program, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Sommers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 looking at the impact of Arkansas\u2019 work requirements.",
      "His research found that about 40% of the other roughly 96% of people on Medicaid in the state were working the required 80 hours a month under the state program. The rest either had medical conditions that prevented them from working or had other responsibilities, such as school or caring for family members.",
      "Implementing work requirements also didn\u2019t result in a higher employment rate \u2014 one of the arguments Arkansas officials used in favor of the new work rules.",
      "\u201cMost people, almost everybody, was already doing what [the state] wanted them to do,\u201d he said. Very few were \u201cthe proverbial on the couch, video game story that we\u2019re hearing from some of the supporters.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, Gibson said, people aren\u2019t actually aware that they\u2019ve lost coverage until they go see their doctors.",
      "\u201cAnd that creates kind of a panic,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they may have something really important scheduled that the doctors won\u2019t do when they run their insurance and find out they no longer have coverage.\u201d",
      "Gibson said the people most often affected by the work requirement are those in noncorporate jobs, including independent workers \u2014 like Uber drivers or delivery workers \u2014 who don\u2019t receive regular pay stubs and can\u2019t meet Georgia\u2019s work verification requirements.",
      "Others include people with certain disabilities that don\u2019t qualify for exemptions, as well as caregivers for children or elderly relatives.",
      "The costs of not having coverage",
      "People who lose coverage often avoid going to the doctor or getting medical care unless it\u2019s an emergency, because they don\u2019t want to accumulate debt, she said.",
      "\u201cThey just don\u2019t get treatment; they don\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d she said.",
      "Heather Payne, 53, of Dalton, Georgia, couldn\u2019t avoid medical care after she had a series of debilitating strokes in 2022.",
      "Unable to work, she was told she didn\u2019t qualify for an Affordable Care Act plan and didn\u2019t qualify for Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program because she was a childless adult.",
      "She later enrolled in classes to become a nurse practitioner \u2014 a career she could pursue despite her disability. By that point, the state\u2019s work requirement had gone into effect. However, Payne was told she still didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid because she wasn\u2019t taking enough credit hours. She couldn\u2019t afford to take more.",
      "To pay for her medical bills, she burned through her $40,000 in savings and is now in collections for tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a problem, there\u2019s no help for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you feel as though society doesn\u2019t care what happens to you.\u201d",
      "Dimitris Terrell, 49, of Clarkston, also worries her 24-year-old son, Justin Anderson, could start to accumulate debt following changes to Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program.",
      "Anderson doesn\u2019t work, but he has Medicaid coverage because he has Crohn\u2019s disease, a bowel disease that can cause chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.",
      "Terrell said her son started having to pay large copays last year, after the state began charging copays for prescription drugs and certain services.",
      "Anderson has paid over $400 out of pocket on doctor\u2019s visits and hundreds of dollars for the dentist, neither of which he could afford, his mother said.",
      "She also worries about his losing coverage \u2014 either because he would no longer qualify or because of missed paperwork.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty sad and shocked,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Like, Mama, I don\u2019t understand why I have to pay.\u2019\u201d"

      "A relatively underappreciated constituency is raising the alarm about President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 gamblers.",
      "Tucked into the nearly 900-page legislation is a change to how gambling losses are taxed that some professional and amateur bettors say could crush the industry.",
      "The provision, only a few paragraphs, would limit what gamblers can deduct from their yearly taxes to 90% of their losses starting in 2026. Currently, bettors can deduct the entirety of their losses, up until their winnings.",
      "What a number of gambling aficionados pointed out on social media was that by limiting the tax deduction to 90% of losses, gamblers could actually owe taxes in years when they netted losses on their bets.",
      "\u201cThis new amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would end professional gambling in the US and hurt casual gamblers, too,\u201d Phil Galfond, a professional poker player, posted to X, including a video summarizing his argument. \u201cYou could pay more in tax than you won. Contact your representative quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump is set to sign the bill into law on Friday. The provision first generated buzz online after the Senate passed the legislation on Tuesday.",
      "One example given on X laid out that under this new setup, if a gambler won $200,000 in a year but lost $210,000, they would actually be able to deduct only $189,000 worth of losses. Meaning they\u2019d have $11,000 in taxable income even though they netted $10,000 in losses during the year.",
      "\u201cA pro who earns $200k/year might have $3m in winnings and $2.8m in losses,\u201d Galfond said in a subsequent tweet. \u201cThis means earning $200k and being taxed as if they earned $480k. This applies to both recreational and professional gamblers.\u201d",
      "Gambling revenues have reached record highs in recent years as legalized gambling has proliferated across the U.S. Thirty-eight states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, now have some form of legalized sports betting, which has exploded following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that broke up Nevada\u2019s monopoly on the practice. In 2024, commercial gaming revenue reached a record high of nearly $72 billion, according to the American Gaming Association, which represents the U.S. gambling industry.",
      "Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat who represents Las Vegas, tweeted Wednesday that she was already seeking to amend the change.",
      "\u201cBuried within the BS Republican Budget bill is a provision that harms poker players and those who gamble by limiting loss deductions,\u201d Titus wrote. \u201cI\u2019m working on a legislative fix that fairly treats gaming losses in the tax code.\u201d",
      "One gaming industry source who spoke with NBC News said the impact of the tax change is still to be determined, though this person said the change would mostly impact professional gamblers rather than recreational players.",
      "In a May 6 letter to the chairs and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee, William C. Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Industry, included maintaining the current deduction for wagering losses as one of three industry-specific tax priorities for the reconciliation package Republicans have advanced.",
      "Other priorities named in the letter, which was obtained by NBC News, included increasing the slot tax reporting threshold from $1,200 to $5,000 and repealing the sports betting excise tax on legal sports wagers. The AGA also named a number of broader tax priorities, including calling for no taxes on tips and maintaining the current corporate tax rate and SALT deductions.",
      "In the letter, Miller described keeping the current gambling loss deduction as \u201ccritical,\u201d adding that it should be expanded to allow for taxpayers who do not itemize their returns to report their net wins and losses as part of their adjusted gross income.",
      "\u201cMaintaining this deduction at its existing levels was absolutely a priority for the legal, regulated gaming industry,\u201d the gaming industry source said. \u201cSo it\u2019s fair to say that with this specific provision, we\u2019re disappointed, and we\u2019ll be monitoring its impact and seeking to work with congressional leaders to fix this before the overall legislation takes effect at the end of this year.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. FanDuel and DraftKings, two of the biggest players in the sports betting market, declined to comment.",
      "\u201cTax code is already punitive to poker players (you get taxed on winning years but can\u2019t write off losing years unless you file as a pro; it\u2019s easy to have a down year even as a good player) and Senate-passed version of OBBBA would make it considerably worse,\u201d Nate Silver, the prominent political data analyst, tweeted.",
      "As gambling, particularly legalized sports betting, has proliferated in recent years, though, researchers have found a negative impact on bettors\u2019 finances, including reduced savings and lower investments in generally safer assets like stocks. Meanwhile, internet searches for gambling addiction and calls to state gambling helplines have increased, particularly among younger men."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends long-standing federal support for solar and wind power, while creating a friendly environment for oil, gas and coal production.",
      "The House of Representatives passed Trump\u2019s megabill Thursday ahead of a White House-imposed deadline, after the Senate narrowly approved the controversial legislation Tuesday.",
      "Trump has made his priorities on energy production clear. The U.S. will rely on oil, gas, coal and nuclear to meet its growing energy needs, the president said last weekend, bashing wind and solar power.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want windmills destroying our place,\u201d Trump told Fox News in an interview that aired June 29. \u201cI don\u2019t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain that are ugly as hell.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s embrace of fossil fuels and hostility to renewable energy is reflected in his signature domestic policy law. It delivers most of the oil and gas sector\u2019s top priorities, according to the industry\u2019s lobby group, while ending tax credits that have played a crucial role in the growth of solar and wind power.",
      "Oil, gas and coal are winners",
      "The law opens up federal lands and waters to oil and gas drilling after the Biden administration enacted curbs, mandating 30 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico over 15 years, more than 30 every year on lands across nine states and giving the industry access to Alaska.",
      "The law also slashes the royalties that producers pay the government for pumping oil and gas on federal lands, encouraging higher output.",
      "\u201cThis bill will be the most transformational legislation that we\u2019ve seen in decades in terms of access to both federal lands and federal waters,\u201d Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group, told CNBC. \u201cIt includes almost all of our priorities.\u201d",
      "The law also spurs oil companies to use a carbon capture tax credit to produce more crude. The tax credit was designed to support nascent technology that captures carbon emissions and stores them underground. Under Trump\u2019s bill, producers would receive an increased tax benefit for injecting those emissions into wells to produce more oil.",
      "The law ends the hydrogen tax credit in 2028, later than previous versions of the bill. Chevron, Exxon and others are investing in projects to produce hydrogen fuel.",
      "\u201cI have a number of members who plan on investing significantly in hydrogen and so the extension to the end of 2028 was a welcome priority that was fulfilled,\u201d Sommers said.",
      "The coal industry is also a big winner from the law, which mandates at least 4 million additional acres of federal land be made available for mining. The law also cuts the royalties that coal companies pay the government for mining on federal land, and allows the use of an advanced manufacturing tax credit for mining metallurgical coal used to make steel.",
      "Solar and wind are losers",
      "The law phases out clean electricity investment and production tax credits for wind and solar that have played a crucial role in the growth of the renewable energy industry. The investment credit has been in place since 2005 and the production credit since 1992. The Inflation Reduction Act extended the life of both until at least 2032.",
      "Solar and wind farms that enter service after 2027 would no longer be eligible for the credits. There is an exception, however, for projects that start construction within 12 months of the bill becoming law.",
      "The phaseout is more gradual than previous versions of the legislation, which had a hard deadline of December 31, 2027. That gave all solar and wind projects just 2.5 years to come online in order to take advantage of the credits.",
      "\u201cDespite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America\u2019s manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,\u201d Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement when the bill passed the Senate.",
      "A related tax credit for using U.S.-made components in solar and wind farms ends for projects that enter service after 2027. A carveout allows projects that start construction within one year of the law\u2019s enactment to claim the credit. The credit was designed to spur demand at U.S. factories in order to break the nation\u2019s dependence on equipment from China.",
      "\u201cIf nothing changes, factories start to close,\u201d Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers Association, told CNBC. \u201cFactories that are on the drawing board that probably penciled [favorably] two weeks ago, maybe don\u2019t pencil now. We\u2019ll see investment slow down in the sector going forward.\u201d",

      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs may be considered a convicted felon following his explosive, seven-week federal trial, but many in and around the music industry said his decadeslong career as a revolutionary producer and hitmaker could grant him a pathway to resume his career.",
      "The music mogul and founder of the renowned Bad Boy Records was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.",
      "Combs, who is responsible for a slew of hit songs during the 1990s and 2000s, will have a lot of work to do to avoid public rejection in the vein of other Black celebrities who have been at the center of damning criminal trials, such as R. Kelly, O.J. Simpson and Bill Cosby.",
      "Industry professionals who spoke to NBC News said Combs can control the narrative of his legacy \u2014 and potentially reinvent himself. While the jury acquitted him of the more serious charges, the trial exposed Combs\u2019 unorthodox \u201cfreak offs\u201d and revealed multiple accusations of sexual and physical abuse \u2014 transgressions that often make celebrities persona non grata.",
      "Entertainment attorney Yemi Adegbonmire of Los Angeles said Combs\u2019 next step to salvage his public persona and career will have to be made with intent and purpose.",
      "\u201cThe path forward is probably going to require him to do something different than we\u2019ve seen with other folks, which is really to engage with accountability, look at rebuilding trust now that we know so much more about the man behind the legend,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has to put himself into a space that allows folks to feel comfortable listening to new music or accepting new ventures from him.\u201d",
      "Doing that will not be easy. People saw surveillance video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. They heard the graphic testimony of witnesses during the trial, many of whom spoke of rampant drug use by Combs and some of whom testified that they were either physically abused by him or witnessed him abuse others.",
      "The industry sources said Combs would need to show humility, become a genuine advocate against domestic violence and drug abuse and enter counseling. And even that may not enable him to reach his previous level of acclaim.",
      "The public perception of Combs \u201cis irrevocably changed,\u201d culture writer Shamira Ibrahim said. \u201cA large part of that was the mystique of the person who was bigger than the world.\u201d",
      "His meteoric ascent as a hustler and producer, working with some of the biggest rising stars in East Coast hip-hop, cemented his place in the industry.",
      "\u201cSean Combs\u2019 impact on music and culture is as undeniable as the music was infectious,\u201d Adegbonmire said.",
      "Combs founded Bad Boy Records in 1993 and forged a roster of stars that jettisoned hip-hop into the mainstream, including the late Notorious B.I.G., Mase, Faith Evans and the groups 112 and Total, among others.",
      "He became a face of the genre, serving as an innovator in producing and marketing, while also projecting an image of wealth and influence, hosting extravagant parties that drew celebrities like Denzel Washington and Kevin Costner. He branched out into fashion, cable TV, alcohol and even politics, urging people to the polls through his \u201cVote or Die\u201d campaign during Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run. His label, Bad Boy, was estimated to be worth $100 million at its peak, and according to Forbes, Combs\u2019 net worth was as high as $825 million in 2018.",
      "Before the accusations of abuse emerged, Combs remained well known but was \u201closing steam\u201d as a music influencer, Ramal Brown, a Tulsa, Oklahoma, radio deejay said. \u201cHe once had control over the media, powerful connections to tell his narrative.\u201d",
      "But he was becoming increasingly less central to hip-hop as tastes shifted away from the Bad Boy style.",
      "The \u201cmystique\u201d Ibrahim said Combs once had as a hip-hop mogul \u201cis gone,\u201d which will make a return to music difficult. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be able to generate that level of cultural cachet in his older years,\u201d she said.",
      "Ibrahim suspects, however, that not everyone will abandon Combs. \u201cI do think he will retain a group of advocates, a group of emissaries, that will continue to protect him, and he will be allowed to be in specific spaces,\u201d Ibrahim said. \u201cWhile R. Kelly might not get played as much at parties, R. Kelly is ubiquitous.\u201d",
      "Warren Ballentine, an activist and national talk radio host, said the charges Combs was acquitted of may boost him in some respect.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he beat a racketeering case is actually going to give him stronger credibility within the hip-hop community,\u201d Ballentine said. \u201cSo, because of that, you may have a lot of these young artists mentioning his name in their songs. It\u2019s sad to say that, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d",
      "Vibe music reporter Amber Corrine said the Combs trial may bring about a larger reckoning in the industry.",
      "\u201cI think this case forces a larger conversation about accountability amongst those power figures in entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we ready to confront these big power players about things that they do?\u201d",
      "When Combs will be  free again is uncertain. He has been in jail since his arrest last September and will remain there until his sentencing hearing on Oct. 3.

      "DHS said Ch\u00e1vez is being processed \"for expedited removal from the United States.\"",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has an ongoing weapons case in Los Angeles County. Goldstein said a court granted Ch\u00e1vez \"mental health diversion\" for potential dismissal of those charges.",
      "The Los Angeles Police Department arrested Ch\u00e1vez on firearm charges in 2023 following a mental health breakdown, Goldstein said.",

    "summary": "It\u2019s not uncommon for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s not uncommon for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to mention sperm counts when he makes a public appearance.",
      "In recent television interviews, political speeches and congressional hearings, Kennedy has repeatedly claimed that teenage boys today have half the sperm that men in their 60s do \u2014 a stat that\u2019s not exactly accurate. Kennedy has cited the talking point as evidence of a broader health crisis in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have fertility rates that are just spiraling. A teenager today, an American teenager, has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man. Sperm counts are down 50%,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters in April, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s an existential problem.\u201d",
      "Contrary to Kennedy\u2019s claims, sperm counts decline with age, so young men have much higher counts than older men. And data about sperm counts in teen boys largely does not exist.",
      "Some researchers contend that men\u2019s overall sperm counts are lower than they were generations ago, based mostly on two papers published in the last decade. Others say there\u2019s no convincing evidence of the trend. And many agree that even if sperm counts are declining, it does not amount to a full-blown fertility crisis.",
      "\u201cThis is a very contentious issue in our field, and for every paper that you find that suggests a decline and raises an alarm for this issue, there\u2019s another paper that says that the numbers aren\u2019t changing, and that there\u2019s no cause for concern,\u201d said Dr. Scott Lundy, a reproductive urologist at the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy is \u201csounding the alarm on a public health issue others are too timid, or too politically cautious, to confront.\u201d",
      "The secretary\u2019s warning feeds on a burgeoning narrative that men today face a fundamental threat to their fertility. Similar claims have been spread by various wellness influencers, tech startups and young men on social media. Young men concerned about a decline in virility have opted to freeze their sperm, abstain from sex or undergo testosterone replacement therapy. A 2022 study found that \u201csemen retention\u201d was the most popular men\u2019s health subject on TikTok and Instagram.",
      "Meanwhile, adherents of the \u201cpro-natalist\u201d movement have argued that more families should be having children to compensate for a decline in fertility and birth rates in the U.S. The most prominent figure among them, Elon Musk, has cited the declining birth rate as an omen of humanity\u2019s collapse.",
      "Researchers who study male fertility say the reality is far more complicated and little cause for panic. Fertility and birth rates in the U.S. are declining, in part, because people are choosing to have fewer children or delaying having kids until later in life. Though some men do struggle to have kids, in many cases the issue can be corrected through medical interventions or lifestyle changes.",
      "In 1993, scientist Louis Guillette shocked Congress when he testified at a hearing that \u201cevery man sitting in this room today is half the man his grandfather was.\u201d",
      "Guillette was referring to a generational decline in sperm count. A year before his testimony, a review of papers published from 1938 to 1991 determined that the average sperm count had fallen around 50%.",
      "But many researchers have since found flaws in the review \u2014 among them, that it included relatively little data from the first few decades of the analysis, the men in the studies were evaluated using different methods and the data analysis did not account for the fact that many men\u2019s sperm counts fall within a lower range.",
      "\u201cThe paper was widely, wildly cited,\u201d but \u201cthe statistics were not solid,\u201d said Dolores Lamb, who researches male infertility at Children\u2019s Mercy Kansas City.",
      "In a follow-up review of studies published from 1992 to 2013, eight studies showed a decline in semen quality, 21 showed no change or an increase, and six showed ambiguous or conflicting results. Based on that, Lamb said, \u201cthe preponderance of the data suggests that there was no decline.\u201d",
      "In 2021, reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan reignited the debate with her book \u201cCount Down,\u201d which warned of falling sperm counts \u201cimperiling the future of the human race.\u201d",
      "A paper Swan and her co-authors published in 2017 determined that from 1973 to 2011, sperm counts declined by 52% in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. A follow-up analysis in 2022 showed a similar trend worldwide. In an interview with The Guardian, Swan said her work implied that the median sperm count could reach zero by 2045.",
      "The research was picked up by men\u2019s rights groups, which pointed to it as evidence that men were losing their masculinity. It even inspired a viral publicity stunt to raise awareness about a possible future where people couldn\u2019t reproduce: A crowd gathered to watch sperm cells race under a microscope.",
      "HHS\u2019 Nixon said the 2017 and 2022 papers support Kennedy\u2019s claims about declining reproductive health.",
      "\u201cA growing body of peer-reviewed research shows significant declines in sperm counts over the past decades, and pretending this isn\u2019t a serious trend is irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data is real, the stakes are high and ignoring it doesn\u2019t make it go away.\u201d",
      "Lamb said the analyses from Swan and her co-authors had a major weakness in their methodology. They assumed that laboratories in different parts of the world were collecting and testing semen in the same way, she said, when in fact the methods likely varied.",
      "Swan stood by her team's results, saying in an email that they accounted for differences in methodologies across studies, as well as the challenges of getting accurate sperm counts.",
      "Lundy, of the Cleveland Clinic, said measuring sperm counts can be hard to do consistently. The count itself can go up and down depending on the frequency of ejaculation, time of year, or whether someone is injured or has a fever.",
      "His analysis last year found a subtle decline in sperm count among men in the U.S. from 1970 to 2018 but one that most likely wouldn\u2019t affect fertility in real life.",
      "\u201cWhat it has done is showed that there\u2019s no cause for widespread panic for the typical U.S. male,\u201d Lundy said.",
      "Researchers who believe sperm counts are declining said it might be influenced by two factors: obesity and environmental chemicals.",
      "\u201cWe know that obesity is one of the strongest predictors of serum testosterone, and also to a lesser extent, of sperm counts,\u201d said Jorge Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In particular, he said, obesity can decrease the secretion of key hormones in the brain that regulate reproduction in both men and women.",
      "A 2023 study also found an association between exposure to pesticides and significantly lower sperm concentrations.",
      "Pesticides \u201ccan imitate or interfere with naturally occurring hormones, and those hormones are necessary for the production of healthy sperm,\u201d said Melissa Perry, the study\u2019s author and dean of the College of Public Health at George Mason University.",
      "Kennedy has blamed both factors for falling sperm counts in the U.S., but some researchers say it\u2019s too soon to draw a link to national or worldwide trends.",
      "Vaping, cigarette smoking and binge drinking can also decrease sperm counts. (Research on marijuana use is mixed, with one study suggesting it can increase sperm counts and another finding the opposite.) Testosterone replacement therapy \u2014 a treatment that has exploded in popularity among young men looking to feel more energized or to increase their sex drive \u2014 can also shut off sperm production entirely.",
      "\u201cMen on testosterone are almost uniformly azoospermic and totally infertile, and sometimes that is only partially reversible if they\u2019ve been on high-dose testosterone for many years,\u201d Lundy said.",
      "Kennedy himself told Newsmax in 2023 that he takes testosterone replacement as part of an \u201canti-aging protocol.\u201d Most doctors say the treatment should be reserved for people with a medical condition and is not meant to counteract the normal aging process or increase vitality in young men.",
      "While sperm count can influence fertility, it\u2019s not the only factor. The shape and movement of sperm can also have an effect, since slow or misshapen sperm can have trouble reaching or fertilizing an egg. Swollen veins in the scrotum called varicoceles can play a role, too.",
      "\u201cIf you lined up 100 men who are having fertility problems, about 35% or 36% would have varicoceles,\u201d said Dr. Stanton Honig, a urology professor at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most treatable, reversible causes of male factor infertility.\u201d",
      "Honig said doctors tend to get concerned when sperm counts fall below 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen, or less than 31% of sperm being mobile. But even then, a suboptimal sperm count doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an inability to reproduce.",
      "\u201cYou have to get to pretty low sperm concentration levels before you start seeing an impact on a couple\u2019s ability to become pregnant,\u201d Chavarro said.",
      "Even men with high sperm counts may struggle to have kids. Up to half of male infertility cases have an unknown cause, according to a 2007 study.",
      "Lundy said the issue deserves more attention to better understand men\u2019s health \u2014 not because of any fears about humanity dying out.",
      "\u201cThis is not the end of our species as we know it,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Just ahead of the long Independence Day weekend, beaches across the country have closed and issued advisories because of  excessive levels of harmful bacteria. The culprit is fecal waste, a common summer problem in both freshwater and oceans that can cause gastrointestinal illness and skin infections.",
      "At least six states have issued closures or advisories for certain beaches and lakes that have tested positive for above-safe levels of fecal bacteria. In Massachusetts, almost two dozen beaches are closed due to excessive bacteria levels. Four beaches in New York are closed. Illinois has issued at least eight advisories in the past few weeks. Los Angeles County had released eight ocean water quality advisories as of Tuesday. Michigan has closed three beaches.",
      "The bacteria causing havoc for summer swimmers include E.coli and Enterococcus \u2014 nasty germs often found in the feces of people and animals. The contamination can occur because of sewage, manure or storm runoff. E.coli is more likely to be found in freshwater, whereas enterococcus can form in both marine and freshwater.",
      "Edward Dudley, director of the E. Coli Reference Center at Pennsylvania State University, said testing bodies of water used for swimming is routine and common, as are closures.",
      "Beach closures are more likely around the summer months, when ocean surface temperatures are high and bacteria can grow more easily, said Antarpreet Jutla, associate professor of environmental engineering sciences at the University of Florida. However, a variety of factors \u2014 including human activity, temperature and water movement \u2014 can affect bacterial growth, he said.",
      "Jutla also said that beach closures due to fecal bacteria are very common.",
      "In North Carolina, officials warned about cyanobacteria algae blooms in Lake Norman, urging people to keep children and pets away from water that appears bright green, blue or scummy.  Different from fecal bacteria, cyanobacteria are the most common cause of algae blooms in freshwater, such as lakes or rivers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research suggests that climate change may be triggering cyanobacterial algae blooms more frequently.",
      "Although the Environmental Protection Agency sets guidelines on safe levels of fecal bacteria, states can set their own water quality and monitoring standards. Some, such as Illinois, test public beaches every two weeks.",
      "\u201cI would say, the higher the levels, probably the higher the risk,\u201d Dudley said.",
      "While fecal waste can lead to many harmful diseases, experts are worried by recent increasing levels of another harmful bacteria: vibrio.",
      "Vibrio is a potentially deadly bacterium that has caused similar beach closures in recent years. The flesh-eating bug thrives in warm, coastal waters. Jutla, who researches vibrio bacteria, has seen vibrio gradually migrate north across the United State. Testing for vibrio depends on each state as well as its concentration limits, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing right now with increasing trends in the entire country, but that\u2019s something that we are really concerned about \u2014 what is going to be present in the coastal waters,\u201d Jutla said about vibrio.",
      "The deadly V. vulnificus is a rare type of the bacterium, but infections have been growing in recent years as it follows warming ocean water up the eastern coast of the U.S."

      "Shandong, escorted by three other homemade warships, kicked off a five-day stop in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory on Thursday. Shandong is named after the eastern coastal province where the country\u2019s first aircraft carrier is based, according to the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily.",
      "Commissioned in 2019, the carrier is China\u2019s first warship fully built and designed in the country. Its flight deck is about the size of two standard soccer pitches, and it is as tall as a 20-story building.",

      "Hong Kong leader John Lee hailed the \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cinspiring\u201d visit of the aircraft carrier as the city marked the fifth anniversary of a Beijing-imposed national security law decried by critics as profound infringement of human rights and civil liberties.",
      "Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, Lee said the visit demonstrated that national security is \u201crock-solid.\u201d",
      "The warships \u201cfully demonstrate to the outside world\u201d the achievement of the Chinese military, said Col. Zhang Junshe, a senior colonel for the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy.",

      "An Oklahoma pediatrician was accused of murder after, authorities said, she staged her daughter\u2019s accidental death at a vacation rental in suburban Miami, court records obtained Thursday show.",
      "Dr. Neha Gupta, 36, was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder in Oklahoma City and is awaiting extradition to Florida in the June 27 death of her daughter, the Miami-Dade Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release.",
      "The 4-year-old girl, identified in an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant as A.T., was found unresponsive in a pool at the home, but her lungs and stomach contained no water, prompting authorities to rule out drowning as the cause of death.",
      "A lawyer for Gupta said Thursday that he was disappointed the sheriff's office \"decided to hastily arrest a grieving mother who fully cooperated with the police and who is absolutely devastated for the loss of her child.\"",
      "\"We look forward to more evidence, evidence that the Miami Dade Sheriff's office could not possibly have obtained in the 24-hour investigation that they completed,\" the lawyer, Richard L. Cooper, said in an email.",
      "According to the affidavit, Gupta traveled to Florida from Oklahoma, where she is a doctor, on June 25 and rented a home in El Portal, north of Miami.",
      "Gupta told authorities that she arrived at the rental with her daughter between 7 and 8 p.m. June 26 after having spent the day at the beach. Gupta awoke the girl to feed her dinner at 9 p.m., and the 4-year-old remained awake until 12:30 a.m., the affidavit says.",
      "Gupta told authorities she was awakened about 3:20 a.m. by a noise and saw that her daughter was not in the bed they were sharing, according to the affidavit.",
      "A sliding glass door to the patio was open, Gupta told authorities, even though she said she had locked it before bed.",
      "Gupta \"stated she then observed the 'deceased victim' submerged underwater within the swimming pool of the residence,\" the affidavit says. 'The Subject' stated she attempted to remove the victim from the pool; however, she was unsuccessful due to the fact that she is unable to swim.\"",
      "Gupta said she tried to help the girl for 10 minutes before she dialed 911, according to the affidavit.",
      "First responders performed CPR, but A.T. was pronounced dead at a hospital at 4:28 a.m., the affidavit says.",
      "During an autopsy Sunday, a pathologist with the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department found that the girl's lungs and stomach were \"dry\" and that cuts in her mouth and bruising in her cheeks were \"not consistent\" with the first responders' lifesaving efforts, according to the affidavit.",
      "The pathologist concluded that the girl was dead before she was put in the pool, the affidavit says.",
      "While the cause and manner of death are pending, the pathologist's preliminary findings indicate that the girl's injuries are consistent with asphyxiation by smothering, the affidavit says.",
      "The autopsy also showed that the girl's stomach was empty, contrary to what Gupta told authorities about having fed her at 9 p.m., the affidavit says.",
      "Gupta \"attempted to conceal the killing of the 'deceased victim' by staging an accidental drowning within the swimming pool of a rental property,\" it says.",
      "The affidavit does not identify a possible motive.",
      "Gupta was in a custody battle with her ex-husband when his daughter died, and he was unaware that she had left Oklahoma, according to the document."

      "Parekh\u2019s name first began to circulate after Suhail Doshi, the former CEO of the analytics startup Mixpanel, wrote a post Wednesday warning those in the tech industry that Parekh was trying to work at several startups at the same time. Parekh didn\u2019t respond to emailed requests for comment.",

      "As claims about him circulated, Parekh began to give interviews.",
      "Parekh admitted working at several startups at once in an interview Thursday with the online daily tech show \u201cTBPN.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not proud of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that I endorse, either. But, you know, financial circumstances, essentially. No one really likes to work 140 hours a week, right? But I had to do this out of necessity. I was in extremely dire financial circumstances.\u201d",
      "Parekh said that to pull off having multiple jobs at once, he is a \u201cserial nonsleeper\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cdo anything outside coding.\u201d He also shot down online rumors that he had a team of engineers working for him or that he was using artificial intelligence tools to acquire more jobs.",
      "The share of people in the United States with multiple jobs recently increased from 5.3% and 5.5%, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "In an X discussion with Andriy Mulyar, the CEO of Nomic AI \u2014 another startup that Parekh worked at \u2014 Parekh said the most jobs he had at a single time was four, at least several of which had six-figure salaries. He estimated that he was bringing in $30,000 to $40,000 per month. Mulyar confirmed to NBC News that the account in the X discussion belonged to Parekh and that Parekh was previously employed at Normic AI.",
      "Parekh said in the \u201cTBPN\u201d interview that he began juggling multiple jobs in 2022. He re-emphasized that he did so out of financial necessity, adding that he had deferred an offer to graduate school and opted for an online degree. A picture of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 posted by Doshi, which Lowe confirmed was the one he had received, says he attended Georgia Tech from September 2020 to May 2022. A spokesperson for the school said in a statement to NBC News that it had no record of a student by that name.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot being said about me right now, and most of you don\u2019t know the full story,\u201d Parekh said on his X account, which he confirmed to be his in the \u201cTBPN\u201d interview. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing to know about me, it\u2019s that I love to build. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ve been isolated, written off and shut out by nearly everyone I\u2019ve known and every company I\u2019ve worked at. But building is the only thing I\u2019ve ever truly known, and it\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep doing.\u201d",
      "Marcus Lowe, the founder of the tech startup Create, shared an experience similar to those of other employers who spoke out online. Lowe confirmed to NBC News that Parekh was the person featured in the \u201cTBPN\u201d video.",
      "Lowe said Parekh aced his in-person interview back in February and even outperformed most candidates. But as his first day of work approached, more and more issues kept arising.",
      "Whether it was that he was sick or that he had family visiting, Lowe said, Parekh would come up with excuse after excuse for why he couldn\u2019t show up to work. He said that at first they seemed believable, until he began to look into Parekh\u2019s GitHub account.",
      "\u201cI happen to notice, actually, on his GitHub profile that he was actually committing code the prior two weeks, too, including the week that he was sick,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSo it was a little odd to me \u2014 I mean, maybe you\u2019re offline if you\u2019re sick. Typically you\u2019re not committing a ton of code.\u201d",
      "Lowe added that when he did some searching, he found that Parekh was committing code to another company called sync.so. He sent a message to the company\u2019s founder, who confirmed to him that Parekh was working there, as well.",
      "\u201cThis was a huge waste of time for us, a big distraction. We\u2019re a small company,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to survive, and just such direct immoral behavior felt worth speaking out about.\u201d",
      "Parekh can be seen at sync.so in several posts by employees at the company, as well as in videos featured on its YouTube channel. An employee confirmed that Parekh was employed at sync.so but declined a request for an interview.",
      "Parekh now says he signed a deal to work at \u201cone company and one company only.\u201d He told \u201cTBPN\u201d that he would be working at another startup called Darwin.",
      "Sanjit Juneja, its founder and CEO, said in an emailed statement: \u201cAt Darwin, we are solely focused on building the most innovative software products for both brands and content creators. Soham is an incredibly talented engineer and we believe in his abilities to help bring our products to market.\u201d"

The recall covers vehicles with either 3-cylinder 1.5L or 4-cylinder 2.0L VC-Turbo engines. Potential repairs \u2014 which will be performed free of charge \u2014 will depend on the engine and whether debris is detected during the inspection.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nissan said it initiated this recall as part of its \u201congoing commitment to customer safety.\u201d And in late August, the company added, notification letters will be mailed out to affected owners \u201cwith instructions to bring their vehicle to a Nissan dealer or INFINITI retailer for inspection and repair if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Nissan\u2019s recall lookup."

      "President Donald Trump said he \"didn't make any progress\" toward a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war when he spoke by phone Thursday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"No, I didn't make any progress with him today at all,\" Trump told reporters when asked about his call with Putin earlier in the day.",
      "\"We had a call. It was a pretty long call. We talked about a lot of things, including Iran, and we also talked about, as you know, the war with Ukraine. And I'm not happy about that, I'm not happy,\" Trump said.",
      "Putin aide Yury Ushakov said in a readout of the call that the two leaders held a \u201cfrank and substantive\u201d conversation and that Trump raised the possibility of an immediate ceasefire in Russia's war with Ukraine but that Putin did not agree. Putin said Russia \"will pursue its stated objectives\" in the conflict, and continues to look for a political resolution to the conflict through negotiations, Ushakov added.",

      "Trump and some of his allies on Capitol Hill are seeking to secure a permanent ceasefire.",

      "U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting fresh record highs, after a better-than-expected jobs report fueled optimism the U.S. economy was hanging tough despite fast-changing trade policy and geopolitics.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 344.11 points, or 0.77%, settling at 44,828.53. The S&P 500 added 0.83% to close at 6,279.35, while the Nasdaq gained 1.02% and ended at 20,601.10. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed at records.",
      "Nonfarm payrolls rose by 147,000 in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. That\u2019s above the Dow Jones forecast from economists for 110,000 and the upwardly revised 144,000 in May. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, while economists had projected an increase to 4.3%.",
      "The strong jobs report also spurred a spike in Treasury yields and reduced expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon. Fed funds futures traders are currently pricing in a roughly 95% chance that the central bank will hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, per CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.",
      "\u201cThe biggest implication from the employment report would seem to be there\u2019s no way the Fed\u2019s cutting rates in July, and it\u2019s a question mark as to whether rates are cut at all this year,\u201d Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, said in an interview with CNBC.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report comes a day after ADP released data showing that private payrolls decreased by 33,000 last month, raising fears that perhaps the economy was starting to stumble under the weight of rapid policy changes out of Washington. Thursday\u2019s official government data knocked down that notion.",
      "Meanwhile, after President Donald Trump announced the U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement Wednesday, investors eagerly awaited any potential future deal announcements as the president\u2019s early July deadline on his 90-day tariff pause approaches next week. While the market trading at all-time high levels leaves it open to downside, especially if Trump chooses to be \u201creally tough\u201d in negotiations, Ellerbroek believes the market is ultimately taking a more optimistic view.",
      "\u201cWe will see a real tariff impact for a lot of businesses, but the market is going to digest that without too much trouble,\u201d he also said.",

      "President Donald Trump is expected Friday to sign into law his sprawling domestic policy bill, which includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d the new legislation will extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts and make up for them in part by slashing federal Medicaid funding, introducing copays for some services and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 implementing nationwide Medicaid work requirements. The final version of the bill didn\u2019t include an estimate of coverage losses; an earlier Congressional Budget Office report projected that about 11 million people could lose their health coverage and become uninsured by 2034 because of the program cuts.",
      "Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, which usually mandate that applicants meet certain criteria, such as low income, disability or caregiving status.",
      "Only two states have implemented Medicaid work requirements: Arkansas in 2018 and Georgia in 2023. Georgia\u2019s program, called Pathways to Coverage, remains in effect.",
      "Over the 10 months Arkansas\u2019 work requirement was in place, more than 18,000 people in the state lost Medicaid coverage. Georgia hasn\u2019t done a good job keeping track of how many have lost coverage, but enrollment remains low, said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.",
      "When people lose Medicaid coverage, they view it as \u201csort of a slap in the face,\u201d Ku said.",
      "\u201cWhen your income is down, when you\u2019re unemployed, that\u2019s when you lose everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re most in need. That\u2019s when you lose your food assistance, that\u2019s when you lose your health insurance coverage.\u201d",
      "Kendall Rogers, 40, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, is looking for a job after he lost his Medicaid coverage this year because of the state\u2019s work requirements, according to his mom, Trudy Rogers, 59.",
      "The change means Trudy now has to take care of herself for long parts of the day. She has fibromyalgia and nerve problems in her back that make it difficult for her to get around.",
      "Kendall was caring for her nearly full time, Trudy said, but Georgia\u2019s work requirements don\u2019t offer exemptions for caregivers for older adults.",
      "She called the new requirements \u201can insult not only to him, but to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause now he\u2019s forced to go out and look for work, and I need him to stay around the house,\u201d she said.",
      "Covered in red tape",
      "To justify the cuts, Republicans have argued that they\u2019re not taking Medicaid from those who are rightfully entitled to it \u2014 such as, they say, single mothers or the disabled \u2014 but from \u201cyoung, able-bodied men\u201d who they say are abusing the system.",
      "\u201cIf you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money, and you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in April.",
      "But as seen in Georgia and Arkansas, that\u2019s not who is largely affected.",
      "Cynthia Gibson, director of the Georgia Legal Services Program\u2019s Health Law Unit, which helps appeal Medicaid denials, said many people in the state lose coverage not because they aren\u2019t working, but because they aren\u2019t aware of the new rules or face administrative issues like missed paperwork or not having received notices. Others, like Kendall Rogers, are caring for family members but don\u2019t qualify for exemptions.",
      "Likewise, in Arkansas, only 3% or 4% of the people on Medicaid in 2018 weren\u2019t working and didn\u2019t qualify for the exemptions under the state program, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Sommers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 looking at the impact of Arkansas\u2019 work requirements.",
      "His research found that about 40% of the other roughly 96% of people on Medicaid in the state were working the required 80 hours a month under the state program. The rest either had medical conditions that prevented them from working or had other responsibilities, such as school or caring for family members.",
      "Implementing work requirements also didn\u2019t result in a higher employment rate \u2014 one of the arguments Arkansas officials used in favor of the new work rules.",
      "\u201cMost people, almost everybody, was already doing what [the state] wanted them to do,\u201d he said. Very few were \u201cthe proverbial on the couch, video game story that we\u2019re hearing from some of the supporters.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, Gibson said, people aren\u2019t actually aware that they\u2019ve lost coverage until they go see their doctors.",
      "\u201cAnd that creates kind of a panic,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they may have something really important scheduled that the doctors won\u2019t do when they run their insurance and find out they no longer have coverage.\u201d",
      "Gibson said the people most often affected by the work requirement are those in noncorporate jobs, including independent workers \u2014 like Uber drivers or delivery workers \u2014 who don\u2019t receive regular pay stubs and can\u2019t meet Georgia\u2019s work verification requirements.",
      "Others include people with certain disabilities that don\u2019t qualify for exemptions, as well as caregivers for children or elderly relatives.",
      "The costs of not having coverage",
      "People who lose coverage often avoid going to the doctor or getting medical care unless it\u2019s an emergency, because they don\u2019t want to accumulate debt, she said.",
      "\u201cThey just don\u2019t get treatment; they don\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d she said.",
      "Heather Payne, 53, of Dalton, Georgia, couldn\u2019t avoid medical care after she had a series of debilitating strokes in 2022.",
      "Unable to work, she was told she didn\u2019t qualify for an Affordable Care Act plan and didn\u2019t qualify for Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program because she was a childless adult.",
      "She later enrolled in classes to become a nurse practitioner \u2014 a career she could pursue despite her disability. By that point, the state\u2019s work requirement had gone into effect. However, Payne was told she still didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid because she wasn\u2019t taking enough credit hours. She couldn\u2019t afford to take more.",
      "To pay for her medical bills, she burned through her $40,000 in savings and is now in collections for tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a problem, there\u2019s no help for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you feel as though society doesn\u2019t care what happens to you.\u201d",
      "Dimitris Terrell, 49, of Clarkston, also worries her 24-year-old son, Justin Anderson, could start to accumulate debt following changes to Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program.",
      "Anderson doesn\u2019t work, but he has Medicaid coverage because he has Crohn\u2019s disease, a bowel disease that can cause chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.",
      "Terrell said her son started having to pay large copays last year, after the state began charging copays for prescription drugs and certain services.",
      "Anderson has paid over $400 out of pocket on doctor\u2019s visits and hundreds of dollars for the dentist, neither of which he could afford, his mother said.",
      "She also worries about his losing coverage \u2014 either because he would no longer qualify or because of missed paperwork.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty sad and shocked,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Like, Mama, I don\u2019t understand why I have to pay.\u2019\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends long-standing federal support for solar and wind power, while creating a friendly environment for oil, gas and coal production.",
      "The House of Representatives passed Trump\u2019s megabill Thursday ahead of a White House-imposed deadline, after the Senate narrowly approved the controversial legislation Tuesday.",
      "Trump has made his priorities on energy production clear. The U.S. will rely on oil, gas, coal and nuclear to meet its growing energy needs, the president said last weekend, bashing wind and solar power.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want windmills destroying our place,\u201d Trump told Fox News in an interview that aired June 29. \u201cI don\u2019t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain that are ugly as hell.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s embrace of fossil fuels and hostility to renewable energy is reflected in his signature domestic policy law. It delivers most of the oil and gas sector\u2019s top priorities, according to the industry\u2019s lobby group, while ending tax credits that have played a crucial role in the growth of solar and wind power.",
      "Oil, gas and coal are winners",
      "The law opens up federal lands and waters to oil and gas drilling after the Biden administration enacted curbs, mandating 30 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico over 15 years, more than 30 every year on lands across nine states and giving the industry access to Alaska.",
      "The law also slashes the royalties that producers pay the government for pumping oil and gas on federal lands, encouraging higher output.",
      "\u201cThis bill will be the most transformational legislation that we\u2019ve seen in decades in terms of access to both federal lands and federal waters,\u201d Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group, told CNBC. \u201cIt includes almost all of our priorities.\u201d",
      "The law also spurs oil companies to use a carbon capture tax credit to produce more crude. The tax credit was designed to support nascent technology that captures carbon emissions and stores them underground. Under Trump\u2019s bill, producers would receive an increased tax benefit for injecting those emissions into wells to produce more oil.",
      "The law ends the hydrogen tax credit in 2028, later than previous versions of the bill. Chevron, Exxon and others are investing in projects to produce hydrogen fuel.",
      "\u201cI have a number of members who plan on investing significantly in hydrogen and so the extension to the end of 2028 was a welcome priority that was fulfilled,\u201d Sommers said.",
      "The coal industry is also a big winner from the law, which mandates at least 4 million additional acres of federal land be made available for mining. The law also cuts the royalties that coal companies pay the government for mining on federal land, and allows the use of an advanced manufacturing tax credit for mining metallurgical coal used to make steel.",
      "Solar and wind are losers",
      "The law phases out clean electricity investment and production tax credits for wind and solar that have played a crucial role in the growth of the renewable energy industry. The investment credit has been in place since 2005 and the production credit since 1992. The Inflation Reduction Act extended the life of both until at least 2032.",
      "Solar and wind farms that enter service after 2027 would no longer be eligible for the credits. There is an exception, however, for projects that start construction within 12 months of the bill becoming law.",
      "The phaseout is more gradual than previous versions of the legislation, which had a hard deadline of December 31, 2027. That gave all solar and wind projects just 2.5 years to come online in order to take advantage of the credits.",
      "\u201cDespite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America\u2019s manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,\u201d Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement when the bill passed the Senate.",
      "A related tax credit for using U.S.-made components in solar and wind farms ends for projects that enter service after 2027. A carveout allows projects that start construction within one year of the law\u2019s enactment to claim the credit. The credit was designed to spur demand at U.S. factories in order to break the nation\u2019s dependence on equipment from China.",
      "\u201cIf nothing changes, factories start to close,\u201d Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers Association, told CNBC. \u201cFactories that are on the drawing board that probably penciled [favorably] two weeks ago, maybe don\u2019t pencil now.

      "An indie psych rock band has amassed more than 850,000 listeners on Spotify in a matter of weeks and generated buzz throughout the music industry \u2014 but nobody is exactly sure if it\u2019s real or not.",
      "The Velvet Sundown, a band bent on \u201cSaving Modern Rock,\u201d according to its Instagram account, has even some music industry veterans confused. The images put forward by the band all look like they were created by artificial intelligence. The music? That\u2019s harder to say.",
      "Rick Beato, a music producer with more than 5 million subscribers on YouTube, identified what he called \u201cartifacts,\u201d particularly in one of the tracks\u2019 guitar and keyboard parts. He said that can indicate a song was created by AI.",
      "\u201cThis is having a lot of problems, and I suspect that it may be because this is an AI track,\u201d Beato said in a YouTube video, after running one of The Velvet Sundown\u2019s songs through Apple\u2019s Logic Pro track splitter. \u201cEvery time you have an AI song, they are full of artifacts.\u201d",
      "Whether the band is real, fake or something in between, its emergence and the broader debate about it add to a growing concern about the future of art, culture and authenticity in the era of advanced generative artificial intelligence. Many major tech platforms have already seen floods of AI-generated content, while AI influencers are becoming increasingly common on social media platforms.",
      "Velvet Sundown appears to have first emerged in June, according to its social media profiles. On Spotify, the band has a \u201cVerified Artist\u201d badge, offering some sense of authority. On X, The Velvet Sundown teased an upcoming album, \u201cPaper Sun Rebellion,\u201d and nodded to questions about doubts about the band\u2019s origins.",
      "Aside from the quick rollout of songs, its uncannily plasticine promotional images of band members have prompted accusations of AI use as well.",
      "In a video announcing the release of its upcoming album later this month, the band pushed back against accusations that it isn\u2019t \u201creal,\u201d stating in one video that \u201cyou believed the lie, and danced to it anyway.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey said we\u2019re not real,\u201d the account posted. \u201cMaybe you aren\u2019t either.\u201d",
      "The band\u2019s bio on Spotify claims that the group is composed of four people: singer Gabe Farrow, guitarist Lennie West, Milo Rains, \u201cwho crafts the band\u2019s textured synth sounds,\u201d and percussionist Orion \u201cRio\u201d Del Mar. Farrow purportedly also plays the mellotron, which is an electro-mechanical instrument that plays recorded sounds when its keys are pressed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something quietly spellbinding about The Velvet Sundown,\u201d their Spotify bio states. \u201cYou don\u2019t just listen to them, you drift into them. Their music doesn\u2019t shout for your attention; it seeps in slowly, like a scent that suddenly takes you back somewhere you didn\u2019t expect.\u201d",
      "Questions about the band\u2019s origins were further complicated after other social accounts purporting to represent the band began rejecting claims that it was using AI-generated images or music, as well as a person who spoke to Rolling Stone claiming to be connected to the band who called it an \u201cart hoax.\u201d That person later admitted in a Substack post that his claim to represent the band was itself a hoax.",
      "The Velvet Sundown said that the person quoted in the article is not affiliated with it in \u201cany way.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe does not represent us, speak for us, or have any connection to this project,\u201d The Velvet Sundown said in a statement to NBC News via Instagram.",
      "On Thursday, the social media accounts tied to the band\u2019s Spotify account posted that \u201csomeone is trying to hijack the identity of The Velvet Sundown by releasing unauthorized interviews, publishing unrelated photos, and creating fake profiles claiming to represent us.\u201d",
      "The Velvet Sundown\u2019s YouTube publisher, Distrokid, did not respond to requests for comment. Spotify also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The band\u2019s meteoric rise highlights modern issues around AI and how difficult it can be to verify what is and is not real on the internet. Last year, Google researchers found that AI image misinformation has surged on the internet since 2023. A Consumer Reports investigation found that leading AI voice-cloning programs have no meaningful barriers to stop people from nonconsensually impersonating others.",
      "According to the music streaming app Deezer, which uses its own tool to identify AI-generated content, 100% of The Velvet Sundown\u2019s tracks were created using AI. Deezer labels that content on its site, ensuring that AI-generated music does not appear on its recommended playlists and that royalties are maximized for human artists.",
      "\u201cAI-generated music and AI bands may generate some value to the user, so we still want to display that,\u201d Alexis Lanternier, the CEO of Deezer, said. \u201cWe just want to make sure that the remuneration is taken in a different way.\u201d",
      "Every week, about 18% of the tracks being uploaded to Deezer \u2014 roughly 180,000 songs \u2014 are flagged by the platform\u2019s tool as being AI-generated. That number has grown threefold in the past two years, Lanternier said.",
      "Suno and Udio, both generative AI music creation programs, declined to say whether The Velvet Sundown\u2019s music was created using their software.",
      "\u201cI think people are getting too far down the rabbit hole of dissecting is it AI, is it not AI? And forgetting the important question, which is like, how did it make you feel? How many people liked it?\u201d said Mikey Shulman, CEO and co-founder of Suno.",
      "According to Suno\u2019s rights and ownership policy, songs made by its users who are subscribed to its higher-tier plans are covered by a commercial use license. That allows them to monetize and distribute songs on platforms like Spotify without attributing them to Suno.",
      "\u201cThere are Grammy winners who use Suno, you know, every day in their production,\u201d said Shulman.",
      "Recently, Grammy Award-winning record producer Timbaland launched an AI artist named TaTa with his new entertainment company, Stage Zero. He told Billboard that TaTa, who created a catalog of AI-generated music through Suno, was neither an \u201cavatar\u201d nor a \u201ccharacter.\u201d",
      "Suno was one of two AI companies sued last year by major record labels \u2014 including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group \u2014 which allege that the companies infringed on the labels\u2019 recording copyrights in order to train their music-generating models.",
      "About a year into the legal battle, however, the music labels have begun talks to work out a licensing deal so that Suno and Udio could use copyrighted recordings by compensating the artists for their work, according to a Bloomberg report published last month.",
      "It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s become worrisome to artists like Kristian Heironimus, who is a member of the band Velvet Meadow (not to be confused with the now-viral The Velvet Sundown).",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been working for, like, six years just constantly releasing music, working my day job,\u201d Heironimus said. \u201cIt is kind of disheartening just seeing an AI band, and then \u2014 in, like, what, two weeks? \u2014 [have] like, 500,000 monthly listeners.\u201d",
      "The creep of generative AI into music and other creative industries has incited backlash from those who worry about the devaluation of their human work, as many AI developers have been known to scrape data from the internet without human creators\u2019 knowledge or consent.",
      "Beyond ethical debates about the consequences of the AI impact on human labor, some online worry about the rise of low-quality AI slop as these tools grow increasingly capable of replicating voices, generating full-length songs and creating visuals from text prompts.",
      "Heironimus said there are similarities between his band, Velvet Meadow, and The Velvet Sundown, beyond the names. One of the members pictured in The Velvet Sundown\u2019s Spotify band photo, for example, looks similar to a photo of Heironimus when he used to have long hair, he said. The bands also fall within the same genre, though Heironimus described The Velvet Sundown\u2019s tracks as \u201csoulless.\u201d",
      "Shulman, of Suno, said most streaming music is already \u201calgorithmically driven.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize just how depersonalized music has become and how little connection the average person has with the artist behind the music,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a failure of imagination to think that in the future, it can\u2019t be a lot better.\u201d",
      "But Lanternier, of Deezer, argues that as AI continues to evolve, streaming platforms should also be trying to ensure artists can make enough royalties to survive.",
      "\u201cPeople are not only interested in the sound. They are interested in the whole story of an artist \u2014 in the whole brand of an artist,\u201d Lanternier said. \u201cWe believe that what is right to do is to support the real artist, so that they continue to create music that people love.\u201d"

    "summary": "Outside the federal courthouse, some influencers showed up in Diddy-inspired costumes and sprayed each other with baby oil.",
    "story": [
      "The verdict in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex-trafficking trial attracted what you'd expect at the end of a high-profile celebrity court case in New York: dozens of news camera crews, hundreds of curious bystanders and a mass showing of law enforcement.",
      "Overshadowing them all was a sea of influencers, content creators and provocateurs, who came out en masse for the trial's verdict Wednesday.",
      "Combs was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking but found guilty of lesser charges.",
      "The streets surrounding the federal courthouse in downtown Manhattan attracted stunts that included hostile \u2014 and livestreamed \u2014 debates, Diddy-inspired costumes and celebrants spraying one another with baby oil (which Combs\u2019 use of in various sex acts was a frequent topic of testimony).",
      "The spectacle was the latest example of how high-profile celebrity trials with real-world consequences have become the perfect breeding ground for online content creators to go viral.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great. I\u2019ve been able to monetize incredibly,\u201d Armon Wiggins said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone viral exponentially, all over TikTok, YouTube. I\u2019ve landed, you know, talk show placements on TMZ.\u201d",
      "Wiggins posts videos with commentary on pop culture on YouTube, amassing more than 285,000 subscribers.",
      "He temporarily moved to New York from Los Angeles in May to cover the trial, posting breakdowns of the daily proceedings on his YouTube and TikTok channels. Wiggins said he\u2019s gained more than 60,000 YouTube subscribers since he started covering the trial.",
      "Similarly, Michelle Bracey of Manhattan found her niche covering Combs' trial.",
      "As with Wiggins, Bracey attended the trial daily and posted her independent analyses on her TikTok account, miss_knockout, cultivating a following for her humorous takes.",
      "When the trial began, she said she had 9,000 followers. She now has more than 40,000.",
      "\"This is a life-changing moment for me personally,\" she said. \"This opened up the doors to a lot of things, like my music, people offering me shows, people offering me stuff for my music.\"",
      "Bracey said she tries to keep her work \"professional\" and avoids the pitfalls of other content creators whom she described as \"clout chasers,\" pointing to several antics throughout the day.",
      "Roughly an hour after the verdict was announced, a group of people who appeared to support Combs' partial acquittal danced and sprayed one another with baby oil.",
      "NBC News video of the celebration shows a woman removing a wig while a man drizzled oil on her from a nearby ledge.",
      "The participants were largely framed online as fans of Diddy. Most appeared to be influencers and new media figures there to create content.",
      "The woman in the video appears to be an influencer who goes by the alias Crackhead Barney and has more than 114,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "Crackhead Barney, who did not share her legal name, told NBC News that she is not a fan of Diddy's but that she is a performance artist who was at the courthouse to shoot \"shock value\" content, with a goal of going viral.",
      "Her videos have garnered backlash, she said, which she wasn't expecting, but said she isn't worried about.",
      "She also said she took issue with a number of influencers at the courthouse Wednesday who were trying to \"police everybody,\" including her.",
      "\"This is a space for everyone. You can say what you want. You can make as much noise as you want,\" she said.",
      "In one video outside the courthouse, the woman asks Sneako, a streamer who has nearly 1 million followers on X and has been tied to the rapper Ye, to pour baby oil on her, and Sneako offered small bottles of baby oil to fans.",
      "Wiggins also took part in the baby oil spectacle.",
      "Throughout the day, two men with opposing views on the Combs conviction also drew particular attention.",
      "One man in a denim jacket and sunglasses questioned a man in a red shirt and bucket hat on whether Combs is going to prison. The man in denim yelled that \u201che beat her,\" referring to Combs' longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura who testified at the trial.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the man in red said.",
      "\u201cHe beat her, he kicked her,\u201d the man in denim shouted.",
      "\u201cAnd she liked it, how about that?\u201d the man in red screamed back.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs beat her on multiple occasions and text messages showed she confronted him several times over it. After he attacked her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016, Ventura wrote to Combs that she was not a rag doll, she\u2019s \u201csomebody\u2019s child,\u201d according to messages entered into evidence.",
      "Other celebrity legal battles, including the defamation suit between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and the shooting of Megan Thee Stallion by fellow rapper Tory Lanez, have similarly provided an opening for online creators.",
      "Some of the influencers who spoke with NBC News on Wednesday said that, now that the Combs trial had concluded, they plan to cover other high-profile cases, including the ongoing legal battle between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni and the case against Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "\"This is just the very beginning, and it will evolve,\" Wiggins said. \"And I think at some point, the courts will have to adjust to that too, you know, and they will have to section off spaces for influencers.\""

    "summary": "It\u2019s not uncommon for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s not uncommon for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to mention sperm counts when he makes a public appearance.",
      "In recent television interviews, political speeches and congressional hearings, Kennedy has repeatedly claimed that teenage boys today have half the sperm that men in their 60s do \u2014 a stat that\u2019s not exactly accurate. Kennedy has cited the talking point as evidence of a broader health crisis in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have fertility rates that are just spiraling. A teenager today, an American teenager, has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man. Sperm counts are down 50%,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters in April, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s an existential problem.\u201d",
      "Contrary to Kennedy\u2019s claims, sperm counts decline with age, so young men have much higher counts than older men. And data about sperm counts in teen boys largely does not exist.",
      "Some researchers contend that men\u2019s overall sperm counts are lower than they were generations ago, based mostly on two papers published in the last decade. Others say there\u2019s no convincing evidence of the trend. And many agree that even if sperm counts are declining, it does not amount to a full-blown fertility crisis.",
      "\u201cThis is a very contentious issue in our field, and for every paper that you find that suggests a decline and raises an alarm for this issue, there\u2019s another paper that says that the numbers aren\u2019t changing, and that there\u2019s no cause for concern,\u201d said Dr. Scott Lundy, a reproductive urologist at the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy is \u201csounding the alarm on a public health issue others are too timid, or too politically cautious, to confront.\u201d",
      "The secretary\u2019s warning feeds on a burgeoning narrative that men today face a fundamental threat to their fertility. Similar claims have been spread by various wellness influencers, tech startups and young men on social media. Young men concerned about a decline in virility have opted to freeze their sperm, abstain from sex or undergo testosterone replacement therapy. A 2022 study found that \u201csemen retention\u201d was the most popular men\u2019s health subject on TikTok and Instagram.",
      "Meanwhile, adherents of the \u201cpro-natalist\u201d movement have argued that more families should be having children to compensate for a decline in fertility and birth rates in the U.S. The most prominent figure among them, Elon Musk, has cited the declining birth rate as an omen of humanity\u2019s collapse.",
      "Researchers who study male fertility say the reality is far more complicated and little cause for panic. Fertility and birth rates in the U.S. are declining, in part, because people are choosing to have fewer children or delaying having kids until later in life. Though some men do struggle to have kids, in many cases the issue can be corrected through medical interventions or lifestyle changes.",
      "In 1993, scientist Louis Guillette shocked Congress when he testified at a hearing that \u201cevery man sitting in this room today is half the man his grandfather was.\u201d",
      "Guillette was referring to a generational decline in sperm count. A year before his testimony, a review of papers published from 1938 to 1991 determined that the average sperm count had fallen around 50%.",
      "But many researchers have since found flaws in the review \u2014 among them, that it included relatively little data from the first few decades of the analysis, the men in the studies were evaluated using different methods and the data analysis did not account for the fact that many men\u2019s sperm counts fall within a lower range.",
      "\u201cThe paper was widely, wildly cited,\u201d but \u201cthe statistics were not solid,\u201d said Dolores Lamb, who researches male infertility at Children\u2019s Mercy Kansas City.",
      "In a follow-up review of studies published from 1992 to 2013, eight studies showed a decline in semen quality, 21 showed no change or an increase, and six showed ambiguous or conflicting results. Based on that, Lamb said, \u201cthe preponderance of the data suggests that there was no decline.\u201d",
      "In 2021, reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan reignited the debate with her book \u201cCount Down,\u201d which warned of falling sperm counts \u201cimperiling the future of the human race.\u201d",
      "A paper Swan and her co-authors published in 2017 determined that from 1973 to 2011, sperm counts declined by 52% in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. A follow-up analysis in 2022 showed a similar trend worldwide. In an interview with The Guardian, Swan said her work implied that the median sperm count could reach zero by 2045.",
      "The research was picked up by men\u2019s rights groups, which pointed to it as evidence that men were losing their masculinity. It even inspired a viral publicity stunt to raise awareness about a possible future where people couldn\u2019t reproduce: A crowd gathered to watch sperm cells race under a microscope.",
      "HHS\u2019 Nixon said the 2017 and 2022 papers support Kennedy\u2019s claims about declining reproductive health.",
      "\u201cA growing body of peer-reviewed research shows significant declines in sperm counts over the past decades, and pretending this isn\u2019t a serious trend is irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data is real, the stakes are high and ignoring it doesn\u2019t make it go away.\u201d",
      "Lamb said the analyses from Swan and her co-authors had a major weakness in their methodology. They assumed that laboratories in different parts of the world were collecting and testing semen in the same way, she said, when in fact the methods likely varied.",
      "Swan stood by her team's results, saying in an email that they accounted for differences in methodologies across studies, as well as the challenges of getting accurate sperm counts.",
      "Lundy, of the Cleveland Clinic, said measuring sperm counts can be hard to do consistently. The count itself can go up and down depending on the frequency of ejaculation, time of year, or whether someone is injured or has a fever.",
      "His analysis last year found a subtle decline in sperm count among men in the U.S. from 1970 to 2018 but one that most likely wouldn\u2019t affect fertility in real life.",
      "\u201cWhat it has done is showed that there\u2019s no cause for widespread panic for the typical U.S. male,\u201d Lundy said.",
      "Researchers who believe sperm counts are declining said it might be influenced by two factors: obesity and environmental chemicals.",
      "\u201cWe know that obesity is one of the strongest predictors of serum testosterone, and also to a lesser extent, of sperm counts,\u201d said Jorge Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In particular, he said, obesity can decrease the secretion of key hormones in the brain that regulate reproduction in both men and women.",
      "A 2023 study also found an association between exposure to pesticides and significantly lower sperm concentrations.",
      "Pesticides \u201ccan imitate or interfere with naturally occurring hormones, and those hormones are necessary for the production of healthy sperm,\u201d said Melissa Perry, the study\u2019s author and dean of the College of Public Health at George Mason University.",
      "Kennedy has blamed both factors for falling sperm counts in the U.S., but some researchers say it\u2019s too soon to draw a link to national or worldwide trends.",
      "Vaping, cigarette smoking and binge drinking can also decrease sperm counts. (Research on marijuana use is mixed, with one study suggesting it can increase sperm counts and another finding the opposite.) Testosterone replacement therapy \u2014 a treatment that has exploded in popularity among young men looking to feel more energized or to increase their sex drive \u2014 can also shut off sperm production entirely.",
      "\u201cMen on testosterone are almost uniformly azoospermic and totally infertile, and sometimes that is only partially reversible if they\u2019ve been on high-dose testosterone for many years,\u201d Lundy said.",
      "Kennedy himself told Newsmax in 2023 that he takes testosterone replacement as part of an \u201canti-aging protocol.\u201d Most doctors say the treatment should be reserved for people with a medical condition and is not meant to counteract the normal aging process or increase vitality in young men.",
      "While sperm count can influence fertility, it\u2019s not the only factor. The shape and movement of sperm can also have an effect, since slow or misshapen sperm can have trouble reaching or fertilizing an egg. Swollen veins in the scrotum called varicoceles can play a role, too.",
      "\u201cIf you lined up 100 men who are having fertility problems, about 35% or 36% would have varicoceles,\u201d said Dr. Stanton Honig, a urology professor at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most treatable, reversible causes of male factor infertility.\u201d",
      "Honig said doctors tend to get concerned when sperm counts fall below 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen, or less than 31% of sperm being mobile. But even then, a suboptimal sperm count doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an inability to reproduce.",
      "\u201cYou have to get to pretty low sperm concentration levels before you start seeing an impact on a couple\u2019s ability to become pregnant,\u201d Chavarro said.",
      "Even men with high sperm counts may struggle to have kids. Up to half of male infertility cases have an unknown cause, according to a 2007 study.",
      "Lundy said the issue deserves more attention to better understand men\u2019s health \u2014 not because of any fears about humanity dying out.",
      "\u201cThis is not the end of our species as we know it,\u201d he said."

      "Two of the court's liberal members, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and  Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented.",
      "\"What the government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,\" Sotomayor wrote.",

      "The Trump administration had asked the court to clarify its June decision, accusing Massachusetts-based U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of being in \"unprecedented defiance\" of the justices.",
      "Murphy had blocked the South Sudan deportations because he deemed them to be in violation of an earlier ruling he made. That ruling said the government must give migrants a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to bring claims that they would be at risk of torture, persecution or death if they were sent to countries the administration has made deals with to receive immigrants who cannot be sent elsewhere.",
      "The Supreme Court in June blocked Murphy\u2019s broad nationwide order, but both Murphy and lawyers representing the plaintiffs said the decision did not apply to the ongoing litigation over whether the eight men in Djibouti needed to have an opportunity to raise specific concerns about being sent to South Sudan.",
      "Murphy, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, has come under heavy fire from MAGA world as a result of his rulings in the case.",

She explained that she bit off part of her tooth while eating dinner the night before and she wanted to see if could smooth the chipped enamel and make it look \u201cmore nonchalant.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared for this,\u201d she said as she started to use the nail file. But afterwards, she was satisfied with her appearance and smiled at the camera.",

      "\u201cWell, I guess, veneer reveal. It was after I graduated college, I think, like in August, I did it. I never wanted to post about it because I immediately feel like I regretted it, and I never want to influence people to do something that I don\u2019t think they should do,\u201d she shared.",

Again, she was pleased with the results, but they didn\u2019t last because didn\u2019t wear her retainers, causing her teeth to shift. So, prior to graduation she underwent a cosmetic procedure called composite bonding. The reversible cosmetic procedure involves applying \u201ctooth-colored resin material to the affected teeth to change their shape, size or color,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "When the material cracked due to her biting her teeth, she finally opted to get veneers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an anxious person. So sometimes, if I have, like, a bad dream, I\u2019ll bite my teeth and they would crack off. It happened a lot, honestly, probably like twice a year they cracked off. Senior year of college (I) started getting a following on here, made some money,\u201d she explained. \u201cBecause I had friends that had veneers on just these two (front) teeth, I was like, \u2018Oh, you know what? That seems like a good idea.\u2019\u201d",
      "She spoke to a dentist who claimed it wouldn\u2019t be possible to only fix two of her teeth. According to her, the dentist said it would not be worth it to get the cosmetic procedure because all her teeth would not look the same.",
      "\u201cSo I went in for two teeth, and I basically left with 10,\u201d she continued as she became emotional. \u201cIt was one of those things that I did it and\u2026I regretted it right away. I think it was really scary for me I was like, \u2018What did I just do?\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI will say I don\u2019t regret a lot. It is something I really regret doing. At the end of the day, whatever, it was my decision. But I feel like it was kind of one of those decisions that was made pretty fast and I just didn\u2019t think it all the way through, or, I think, talk to enough people.\u201d",
      "Despite some moments of insecurity since then, she has grown to like her smile.",
      "\u201cI actually like the character in my teeth. It\u2019s great,\u201d she said.",
      "Toward the end of the video, she apologized to any fans who might be upset that she didn\u2019t share this information sooner.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about doing anything to your teeth, this is your sign to not do it and to embrace your natural teeth,\u201d she concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t follow my lead on this one.\u201d"

      "On July 2, ahead of the long-running summer competition show\u2019s premiere on Thursday, July 10, CBS shared first-look images of the newly designed \u201cBig Brother\u201d house and revealed the theme for the season: \u201cA Summer of Mystery.\u201d",
      "In a press release, the network teased that the houseguests will soon move into \u201cHotel Myst\u00e8re, a place where secrets lurk behind every door and nothing is as it seems.\u201d",
      "What does that mean? Well, CBS explained that the season premiere will include \u201cunexpected twists and turns including a masked visitor, a secret accomplice and the shocking arrival of a \u2018Mystery Houseguest\u2019 whose identity will remain under wraps \u2026 at least for now.\u201d",

      "In an Entertainment Weekly interview published July 3, the host said the mystery houseguest will be a \u201cpolarizing\u201d figure who viewers will surely have an opinion about.",
      "\u201cWhat I can say is the mystery houseguest, when I was told who this person is, I had to expect the unexpected! I never expected that person,\u201d Chen Moonves shared. \u201cAnd I was very excited because, in my opinion, getting that person is epic. And that person is also very polarizing. So there\u2019s going to be a strong reaction in both directions for this mystery houseguest.\u201d",
      "As for the secret accomplice, Moonves revealed that the person will be required to complete certain tasks.",
      "She said, \u201cThe accomplice this person\u2019s going to have \u2014 they\u2019re going to have responsibilities, and they may or may not be able to pull it off, and that will affect the game.\u201d",
      "The host described the masked visitor as a more \u201cdisruptive\u201d version of the AI Bot A.I.N.S.L.E.Y. who took over last season.",
      "\u201cAinsley could do only so much, but this masked visitor is going to wreak havoc in ways that we\u2019ve never seen before. And I would say on a deeper level. Much deeper. It\u2019s more three dimensional,\u201d she teased.",
      "Speaking of Season 26, Moonves suggested that the AI Arena, which allowed three nominees to compete for another chance at safety on eviction night, could return this year.",
      "\u201cYeah, I was a huge fan of it, as was everyone internally. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but last summer it worked so well, so we extended it. Because it wasn\u2019t supposed to go on for as long as it did,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason I liked it so much is because at the beginning of each season, there tends to be this herd mentality where there\u2019s no surprise on eviction night because the whole house goes one way.\u201d",
      "Moonves added, \u201cSo things that work well tend to make an appearance again. I mean, look at the Power of Veto. That became a staple after Season 3. So I would say it\u2019s like shaking the Magic 8 Ball \u2014 signs are pointing to yes.\u201d",
      "She also said the mystery theme will affect the houseguests and viewers at home. For instance, the host explained that some items in the house might appear ordinary but will play a role in how the game unfolds this season.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a detective this year to play this game,\u201d she advised the Season 27 houseguests.",

    "summary": "What happened on the Carnival Triumph? Trainwreck Poop Cruise true story.",
    "story": [
      "Imagine nearly everything that can go wrong on a cruise ship holding over 4,000 people, and you likely have guessed the true story explored in one of Netflix\u2019s new documentary sensations.",
      "\u201cTrainwreck: Poop Cruise\u201d tells the tale of an infamous cruise ship disaster over ten years later.",
      "The 55-minute film, released June 24, includes firsthand accounts of several passengers who spent almost five days on the Carnival Triumph after it was left floating at sea without functional plumbing or electricity in 2014.",
      "While it seems like this incident is something that could only be imagined, it was a reality for over 3,000 unlucky passengers and over 1,000 crew members.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What happened on the Carnival Triumph?",
      "In February 2014, 4,200 passengers and crew members were stuck at sea aboard the Carnival Triumph.",
      "The cruise was meant to follow a four-day roundtrip route from Galveston, Texas to Cozumel, Mexico.",
      "However, on the fourth day of the cruise, a power outage left the boat floating in the middle of the ocean, waiting to be tugged to land, NBC News reported at the time.",
      "While the ship was first going to be taken to Mexico, strong winds carried the boat so far north in the Gulf it had to be taken to Mobile, Alabama, instead.",
      "The conditions on board were harrowing, as reported by passengers interviewed at the time. With no electricity on the ship, passengers took to sleeping on the ship\u2019s deck to escape their hot rooms and used sheets to create makeshift tents on deck.",
      "Conditions on board were already difficult without electricity. Add to the mix that ship's plumbing also halted.",
      "\u201cThe worst part is the bathrooms,\u201d passenger Donna Gutzman told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s no water. You can\u2019t really flush so everyone\u2019s going in little plastic baggies and putting it outside their rooms.\u201d",
      "The ship eventually returned to land on Feb. 14.",
      "Why did the power go out?",
      "The cruise ship lost power after an engine room fire. After the ship's return, the Coast Guard concluded that a fuel oil return line leak sprayed onto a hot surface in the room, starting a flame, NBC News reported.",
      "The U.S. Coast Guard Marine Casualty Investigation Team said the ship\u2019s crew \u201cdid a very good job\u201d in responding to the fire.",
      "The damage was caused to a small area of the engine room, but because the oil burned at such a large temperature, the room had to be closed off. Crew members were not able to set out the blaze immediately.",
      "This fire created a domino effect that cut out the ship\u2019s power and halted its toilets.",
      "NBC News later reported that Carnival knew about the risk of leaks from engine fuel hoses, according to court documents surfaced in a lawsuit later filed against the corporation on behalf of dozens of the ship\u2019s passengers.",
      "Carnival said, in a response, that the ship\u2019s engines passed inspection before departure.",
      "What did people say about their experiences?",
      "Passengers on the Carnival Triumph spoke about how what was meant to be a vacation turned into a nightmare.",
      "Wondering what a ship holding thousands of people without working plumbing smells like? One person compared the conditions of the sewage-soaked ship to a zoo, NBC News reported.",
      "Clark Jones, one of the ship's passengers, told NBC News at the time that he saw people hoarding food and protecting their turf on ship. Jones said recounted the conditions as \u201cprimitive.\u201d",
      "Another passenger on the ship, Julie Billings, told NBC News that the experience \u201cwas like post-natural disaster, but stuck on a boat with 3,200 other people, and those poor workers trying to clean up after everyone and deal with everyone freaking out.\u201d",
      "As the ship made its way to dock in Mobile, NBC News reported people chanting to be let off and using bed sheets to make giant sigs spelling out \u201cSOS!\u201d or \u201cSweet Home Alabama!\u201d",
      "NBC News also reported that passengers were grateful for the crew\u2019s response to the unprecedented experience. Janie Baker told MSNBC at the time that the crew was \u201cfantastic,\u201d despite the tempers of those on board \u201cflying\u201d by the final night.",
      "Though not all were satisfied. \u201cIt was mistake after mistake after mistake, incompetence to a point I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d passenger Mark Mazan said on TODAY.",
      "What did Carnival say about the incident?",
      "As passengers made it back on dry land, NBC News reported that former Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Gerry Cahill apologized for the ordeal.",
      "\u201cWe pride ourselves on providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,\u201d Cahill said at the time.",
      "Carnival provided passengers with food, phones, blankets and refreshments upon their arrival in Mobile.",
      "Buses arrived to take passengers to their flights home or to hotels.",
      "The first passenger to file suit did so hours after returning to land, seeking unspecified damages against Carnival Corp. saying \u201cshe was \u201cinjured as a result of the unseaworthy, unsafe, unsanitary, and generally despicable conditions,\u201d NBC News reported. Other passengers joined the lawsuit, which was settled out of court in 2016.",
      "Carnival suspended the Triumph through mid-April and gave $500 to each passenger. They also reimbursed each passenger\u2019s trip, their purchases onboard and gave them a free future cruise.",
      "While the ship failed its first inspection after $115 million in repairs, the Carnival Triumph is back at sea, renamed the Carnival Sunrise."

    "story": [
      "Ahmir Thompson, better known as Questlove, spent the better part of two years watching \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Literally.",
      "\"I would do, on an average, maybe three episodes a day,\" the musician and filmmaker tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "\"I started in 2021 (and) around late 2023 is when I finally reached the 900th episode,\" he says of his research on the famed sketch-comedy show ahead of its 50th anniversary earlier this year.",
      "But what initially was intended as a compilation of clips for a retrospective of \"SNL's\" greatest music moments turned into a full-fledged labor of love once the Roots drummer and \"Tonight Show\" bandleader began rewatching the show.",
      "\"Basically, in the beginning, I just thought, 'OK, 50 years of \"SNL\" means I'll find the 50 best music performances. Easy-peasy,'\" Questlove recalls.",
      "\"Then, by the time I got to 1988, I already had 39 slots filled and thought there was no way I was going to get to 2025 without breaking someone's heart or ruining my reputation,\" he says.",
      "So, the musician and producer shifted gears and started over.",
      "\"I just started from the beginning and decided that maybe I should watch all the episodes,\" he says. Once he did, everything changed.",
      "\"I decided that this is not going to be a clip show. This is going to be a real narrative documentary,\" says Questlove, who notably picked up an Oscar in 2022 for \"Summer of Soul ( ... Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised),\" a documentary on the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival.",
      "The result of his two-year odyssey is \"Ladies & Gentlemen \u2026 50 Years of 'SNL' Music,\" a two-hour feature now streaming on Peacock chronicling the hundreds of acts that have performed on \"SNL's\" legendary stage and the indelible mark they've left on TV history. (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\"I love 'SNL' more than the air I breathe. So never once did it feel like work,\" says Questlove. \"Even now, I'm still at tapings as if I'm still doing research, knowing good and well, like, it's over.\"",
      "Along with chronicling memorable musical guests and moments, Questlove also included a variety of cameos and sketches in the documentary, citing their importance in the show's overall cultural impact.",
      "\"It'd be Billy Murray singing 'Star Wars' or Eddie Murphy doing 'Hot Tub,' even the Debbie Downer, womp, womp, womp, womp,\" he says, adding Debbie Downer sound effects for good measure.",
      "\"Most of the memorable things that we love 'SNL' for usually has a musical component that we attach it to.\"",
      "According to Questlove, he\u2019d watch episodes, then take notes on anything music-related that occurred during the 90-minute show, starting with \"SNL's\" debut on Oct. 11, 1975. That fateful first episode featured performances by not one, but two guests: Billy Preston and Janis Ian.",
      "Among the viewers watching that night was Questlove.",
      "\"I was 5 years old,\" he says. It was a seminal moment that would launch a lifelong passion for the show he'd one day go on to document for the history books.",
      "\"I\u2019m just really glad that I got chosen to be able to capture lightning in a bottle or just be in the zeitgeist of learning and teaching at the same time. That\u2019s the important thing for me.\"",
      "Watching Elton John With Madonna: 'She Was Just as Gobsmacked As I Was'",
      "Even though it's been on the air for five decades, Questlove says \"SNL\" is as relevant and \"strong\" as it was 50 years ago.",
      "\"There was a period where it was almost, like, customary, almost obligatory, to trash 'SNL.' Like, the whole 'Saturday Night Dead' or, 'It's not funny like it used to be,'\" he explains, saying it took him a while to realize it's not an \"SNL\" thing as much as it is a generational thing.",
      "\"You grasp on it, like, either in late middle school or the beginning of high school, and then it becomes your thing in college. Then you sort of step off the train once you go to adulthood. But another generation comes and embraces it,\" he says.",
      "\"Once I realized that it's just the passing down of the torch of a generation, then I realized that 'SNL' still has the power to speak to people.\"",
      "Indeed, he says the show spoke to him as he sat in the audience and watched Elton John perform live this past season.",
      "\"That moment was so powerful \u2014 looking to my left, in full civilian mode, was Madonna, literally four seats over. And she was just as gobsmacked as I was. And I was like, 'Wait a minute, no bodyguards, no fans. You're just sitting here like a regular person who wants this,'\" he says of John's April 5 performance.",
      "\"That's how powerful it was. We sat (and) it almost drove us to tears. That's how I realize there's still magic there.\"",
      "On Lady Gaga Hosting: 'It Was a Historical Moment'",
      "John was far from the only highlight this past season. Lizzo, Bad Bunny, Benson Boone, Stevie Nicks, Coldplay and Billie Eilish, among others, also took the stage during \"SNL's\" 50th season.",
      "But according to Questlove, one musician took their performance to the next level: Lady Gaga.",
      "Though the legendary singer has performed on the \"SNL\" stage a total of five times since 2009, it's her most recent turn as host and musical guest that the drummer says was a true game changer.",
      "\"She kind of wanted to redo, like, make a memorable moment happen that she didn't get to make happen the last time she hosted the show. And she did it,\" he says of Lady Gaga's March 8 appearance on \"SNL.\"",
      "\"That's the first time where I saw someone in every sketch and doing these intricate performances,\" Questlove continues.",
      "\"That's the magic of 'SNL,'\" he concludes. \"I'm glad I was there. It was a historical moment that we'll talk about decades from now.\""

      "\"Jurassic World's\" breakout star tucks into a backpack and chomps on licorice with her tiny teeth. Her name is Dolores, and she\u2019s quickly become the soft spot of \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d",
      "When the film made its theatrical debut on July 2, audiences encountered a dinosaur not yet seen before in the franchise: an Aquilops, brought to life not only by special effects but also by an animatronic figure.",
      "In the six previous entries of the \u201cJurassic\u201d franchise, moviegoers learned to brace for colossal carnivores, bone-rattling reptile rumbles and bloody-slicked jungle terrain. But Dolores' big eyes and playful energy likens her more to a pet than a predator.",
      "In a June 26 behind-the-scenes featurette, actor Rupert Friend, who portrays Martin Krebs, described Dolores as \u201cadorable,\u201d adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite character in the film. She's probably mine.\"",
      "Similar affection for the dinosaur was extended when she appeared on TODAY June 25 alongside co-star Scarlett Johansson, who goaded co-anchor Craig Melvin into giving her a kiss.",
      "\"She's a diva,\" Johansson gushed, adding. \"Give Dolores a kiss!\"",
      "She might be an animatronic, but she certainly appeared real enough to Craig, who hesitated several times before finally plopping a kiss on her head.",
      "\"She is sweet, not as sweet as you,\" Craig told Johansson.",
      "What Kind of Dinosaur Is Dolores?",
      "Dolores is an Aquilops who made her feature debut in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d She strikes a connection with the film\u2019s character Isabella (played by Audrina Miranda), whom the dinosaur comforts when Isabella is frightened.",
      "\u201cThe reason why our relationship is so good in the movie is because I was scared and she just happened to crawl along and help me,\u201d explains Miranda in the behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "Isabella eventually learns that Dolores isn\u2019t like the dangerous teeth-gnashing dinosaurs on the island. Instead, Dolores enjoys licorice and is up for being carried around in Isabella\u2019s backpack.",
      "David Iacono, who portrays Xavier in the film, describes her in the featurette as a \u201cfun-loving puppy.\u201d",
      "How Big Was Aquilops?",
      "When Aquilops, who inspired Dolores, existed more than 100 million years ago, it was believed to be nearly two feet long according to the Sam Noble Museum at the University of Oklahoma. Or, roughly the size of a small cat!",
      "How Was Dolores Brought to Life in \u2018Jurassic World Rebirth\u2019?",
      "Instead of being created solely through CGI, special effects artists brought Dolores to life in an animatronic form, according to NBC Insider. The Dolores puppet was operated via radio controllers, capable of making the dinosaur blink and move her head, body, jaw and tail.",
      "As a result, Dolores didn't just feel real on screen. According to the film\u2019s director, Gareth Edwards, Dolores' cuteness factor meant it was hard to tear the cast and crew away from her.",
      "\"The days we had the Aquilops on set were very long days because people wouldn't go home,\" Edwards explains. \"They would stop and they'd want to pet her.\""

      "\u201cI saw the value in it when I started to apply it to my own relationship. Those were our everyday conversations. So you don\u2019t take a risk, then you don\u2019t get a reward,\" she says.",

      "\u201cIt just even made it more special, having that moment with her. And I can\u2019t wait to see it again,\u201d AJ tells TODAY.com. \u201cI probably watched it 30,000 times in the hotel, but I can\u2019t wait to watch it again and just know that our love is literally there for any time that we want to relive that.\u201d",
      "In the reunion, AJ also upgraded Britney\u2019s ring with a shinier flair.  \u201cI had to make sure she got right because the ring I got her before wasn\u2019t what she needed to be,\u201d she says.",
      "Britney is very enthusiastic about the episodes dropping, so she can freely share the news.",

      "AJ shares that Marita was her biggest cheerleader in her proposal. In the reunion, they shout her out for help, reassuring AJ that Britney\u2019s love for her will come before her business.",
      "AJ jokes that she was shocked Britney cooked Marita oxtail.",
      "\u201cOxtails are expensive. They are a delicacy. They are rare. It is hard,\u201d AJ tells TODAY. \u201cYou do not cook any woman oxtail. You just don\u2019t do it.

Now I\u2019ve got to be the bad guy.\u2019 It could have been chicken or fettuccine Alfredo!\u201d",

      "Appearing on a July 1 episode of \"Bussin' With The Boys,\" a podcast hosted by former NFL players Will Compton and Taylor Lewan, Kelce opened up about breaking into the acting world and some of its challenges.",
      "Reminiscing on his \"Saturday Night Live\" hosting gig in March 2023, Kelce said that while he felt \"so much more comfortable\" doing comedy, he still felt nervous and was concerned that he wouldn't be taken seriously.",
      "Kelce remembered thinking, \u201c\u2018I want to take advantage of this, like, I want to have fun doing it but I don\u2019t want to look like a loser doing this. I want to make them respect my approach and how I\u2019m taking it serious.\u201d",

      "When asked about the \u201cSNL\u201d writers\u2019 rooms, Kelce called them \u201cfun because you\u2019re just getting pitched ideas.\u201d But when it came time for the table read, the football star called the experience the \u201chardest f---ing part\u201d about being on the show.",
      "\"The table reading \u2014 for a guy that can\u2019t really read that well \u2014 it was kind of a f--- situation,\" he said. \"I felt like I was just trying to get through the reading instead of actually acting it out and giving it a voice and giving it a character, things like that.\"",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I see myself kind of focusing, like those fun cameos,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201clike in \u2018Happy Gilmore,\u2019 I\u2019m a waiter. Like a fun a-- f------ role in a movie with a guy, Adam Sandler, who I\u2019ve loved my entire life.\u201d",

      "In 2024, Kelce took on his first \"serious\" acting role as Eddie Lachlan in Ryan Murphy's show \u201cGrotesquerie.\u201d While he credited the \"really good cast\" for showing him the ropes, he said he felt out of his comfort zone \"preparation wise.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so prepared for an NFL game,\u201d Kelce explained. \u201cIn my career field, I get an entire week to figure out a scheme, how I\u2019m going to attack somebody, how I\u2019m going to handle certain specific situations. And when you go into acting, it\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t feel as prepared.\u201d",

      "Two days later, Iran launched a missile attack against an American military base in Oman. This saw some flights diverted from the busy international hub of Doha, in the United Arab Emirates, but no one was injured and President Donald Trump called it \"very weak.\"",

      "However the International Atomic Energy Agency and others have become concerned at Iran's enriching of uranium to 60% \u2014 near to the 90% needed to make a bomb \u2014 which it started doing after Trump walked away from the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "Asked if Iran planned to continue, Takht-Ravanchi said, \"Our policy has not changed on enrichment.\" Under the NPT, \"Iran has every right to do enrichment within its territory,\" he said. \"The only thing that we have to observe is not to go for militarization.\"",
      "Iran, he said, \"ready to engage with others to talk about the scope, the level, the capacity of our enrichment program.\"",
      "IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has suggested that Iran's 880 pounds of highly-enriched uranium may have been moved somewhere else before the attacks. Takht-Ravanchi declined to comment.",
      "\"I do not know where those materials are, and I will stop at that,\" he said."

      "BEERSHEBA, Israel \u2014 American contractors guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished.",
      "They said their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. One contractor said bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit.",
      "\u201cThere are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly,\u201d the contractor said.",
      "He said American staff on the sites monitor those coming to seek food and document anyone considered \u201csuspicious.\u201d He said they share such information with the Israeli military.",
      "Videos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites show hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets, stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray.",
      "Other videos include conversation between English-speaking men discussing how to disperse crowds and encouraging each other after bursts of gunfire. NBC News has not obtained or reviewed the videos.",
      "The testimonies from the contractors \u2014 combined with the videos, internal reports and text messages obtained by the AP \u2014 offer a rare glimpse inside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strip\u2019s population. Last month, the U.S. government pledged $30 million for the group to continue operations \u2014 the first known U.S. donation to the group, whose other funding sources remain opaque.",
      "In a statement issued in response to the AP\u2019s report, GHF said they had launched an investigation, which included reviewing the videos, and concluded that the claims in the story are \u201ccategorically false,\u201d and questioned the credibility of the reporting. The organization added that they are pursuing legal action against the news outlet.",
      "Journalists have been unable to access the GHF sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones. The AP and NBC News cannot independently verify the contractors\u2019 stories.",
      "On Wednesday, officials in Switzerland initiated proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal shortcomings in its establishment, Reuters reported.",
      "The group is registered in the U.S. state of Delaware and had registered an affiliate in Geneva on Feb. 12. The Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA), a Swiss regulatory body, told Reuters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account.",
      "\u201cGHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out activities in Switzerland ... and that it intends to dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),\u201d the ESA said in a statement obtained by Reuters.",
      "A spokesperson for Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP that there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. In scattered incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. That happened in the early days at the \u201cthe height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the 21-month war, Israel has bombarded and laid siege to the strip, leaving many teetering on the edge of famine, according to food security experts.",
      "For 2 1/2 months before GHF\u2019s opening in May, Israel blocked all food, water and medicine from entering Gaza, claiming Hamas was stealing the aid being transported under a preexisting system coordinated by the United Nations. It now wants GHF to replace that U.N. system. The U.N. says its Gaza aid operations do not involve armed guards.",
      "Over 57,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the war erupted, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants.",
      "GHF is an American organization, registered in Delaware and established in February to distribute humanitarian aid during the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis. Since the GHF sites began operating more than a month ago, Palestinians say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points, through Israeli military zones. Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and witnesses.",
      "In response, Israel\u2019s military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says it\u2019s examining how to reduce \u201cfriction with the population\u201d in the areas surrounding the distribution centers.",
      "AP\u2019s reporting for this article focuses on what is happening at the sites themselves. Palestinians arriving at the sites say they are caught between Israeli and American fire, said the contractor who shared videos with the AP.",
      "\u201cWe have come here to get food for our families. We have nothing,\u201d he recounted Palestinians telling him. \u201cWhy does the [Israeli] army shoot at us? Why do you shoot at us?\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the GHF said there are people with a \u201cvested interest\u201d in seeing it fail and are willing to do or say almost anything to make that happen. The spokesperson said the team is composed of seasoned humanitarian, logistics and security professionals with deep experience on the ground. The group says it has distributed the equivalent of more than 50 million meals in Gaza in its food boxes of staples.",
      "GHF says that it has consistently shown compassionate engagement with the people of Gaza.",
      "Throughout the war, aid distribution has been marred by chaos. Gangs have looted trucks of aid traveling to distribution centers and mobs of desperate people have also offloaded trucks before they\u2019ve reached their destination. Earlier this month, at least 51 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded while waiting for the U.N. and commercial trucks to enter the territory, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and a local hospital. Israel\u2019s military acknowledged several casualties as soldiers opened fire on the approaching crowd and said authorities would investigate.",
      "AP spoke to the two contractors for UG Solutions, an American outfit subcontracted to hire security personnel for the distribution sites. They said bullets, stun grenades and pepper spray were used at nearly every distribution, even if there was no threat.",
      "Videos of aid being dispensed at the sites seen by the AP appear to back up the frenetic scenes the contractors described. The footage was taken within the first two weeks of its distributions \u2014 about halfway into the operations.",
      "In one video, what appear to be heavily armed American security contractors at one of the sites in Gaza discuss how to disperse Palestinians nearby. One is heard saying he has arranged for a \u201cshow of force\u201d by Israeli tanks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be too aggressive,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause this is calming down.\u201d",
      "At that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots. \u201cWhoo! Whoo!\u201d one contractor yelps.",
      "\u201cI think you hit one,\u201d one says.",
      "Then comes a shout: \u201cHell, yeah, boy!\u201d",
      "The camera\u2019s view is obscured by a large dirt mound.",
      "The contractor who took the video told AP that he saw other contractors shooting in the direction of Palestinians who had just collected their food and were departing. The men shot both from a tower above the site and from atop the mound, he said. The shooting began because contractors wanted to disperse the crowd, he said, but it was unclear why they continued shooting as people were walking away.",
      "The camera does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at. But the contractor who filmed it said he watched another contractor fire at the Palestinians and then saw a man about 60 yards (meters) away \u2014 in the same direction where the bullets were fired \u2014 drop to the ground.",
      "This happened at the same time the men were heard talking \u2014 effectively egging each other on, he said. In other videos furnished by the contractor, men in grey uniforms \u2014 colleagues, he said \u2014 can be seen trying to clear Palestinians who are squeezed into a narrow, fenced-in passage leading to one of the centers. The men fire pepper spray and throw stun grenades that detonate amid the crowd. The sound of gunfire can be heard. The contractor who took the video said the security personnel usually fire at the ground near the crowds or from nearby towers over their heads.",
      "During a single distribution in June, contractors used 37 stun grenades, 27 rubber-and-smoke \u201cscat shell\u201d projectiles and 60 cans of pepper spray, according to internal text communications shared with the AP.",
      "That count does not include live ammunition, the contractor who provided the videos said.",
      "One photo shared by that contractor shows a woman lying in a donkey cart after he said she was hit in the head with part of a stun grenade.",
      "An internal report by Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF to run the sites, found that aid seekers were injured during 31% of the distributions that took place in a two-week period in June. The report did not specify the number of injuries or the cause. SRS told the AP the report refers to non-serious injuries.",
      "More videos show frenzied scenes of Palestinians running to collect leftover food boxes at one site. Hundreds of young men crowd near low metal barriers, transferring food from boxes to bags while contractors on the other side of the barriers tell them to stay back.",
      "Some Palestinians wince and cough from pepper spray. \u201cYou tasting that pepper spray? Yuck,\u201d one man close to the camera can be heard saying in English.",
      "SRS acknowledged that it\u2019s dealing with large, hungry populations, but said the environment is secure, controlled, and ensures people can get the aid they need safely."

      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also signaled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing his successor.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after he fled Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "Anxiety is mounting over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, in which he is worshiped as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion. His succession plan is likely to have an impact on Tibetans opposed to China\u2019s tight control of the Himalayan autonomous region.",
      "The Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "The Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",

      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",

    "story": [
      "LIUYANG, China \u2014 There are few sights more dazzling than fireworks on the Fourth of July. Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.",
      "The U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them \u2014 including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations \u2014 coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.",
      "Though most Chinese-made fireworks were shipped in time for this year\u2019s Fourth of July celebrations, uncertainty hangs over future holidays as well as the \u201cgrand celebration\u201d Trump has promised for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.",
      "U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.",
      "The uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the world\u2019s fireworks.

      "Wendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a \u201creally hard time\u201d when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, it\u2019s 100%. But in the afternoon, it\u2019s like 200%,\u201d Tang said, making it \u201cvery hard\u201d for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.",
      "Her U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.",
      "\u201cMy customers said: \u2018OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day,\u2019\u201d said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next year\u2019s July Fourth.",

      "\u201cTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production \u2014 they will only increase costs,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Though fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trump\u2019s first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: \u201cReal prosperity and patriotism isn\u2019t celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets \u2014 it\u2019s having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.",
      "At Tang\u2019s factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.",

      "To prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.",

      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "A year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there,\u201d said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",
      "\"They've put a gun to my head, they\u2019ve threatened me, they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m done, that\u2019s it. But the most horrible thing I\u2019ve seen is how they killed my best friend,\u201d the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.",
      "\u201cI was required to do many things ... they send us to train to use a firearm, all of that comes together and from there come the hit men, from there come the thieves, the hawks,\u201d he said, referring to the murderers, thieves and drug traffickers.",
      "'They are recruiting more minors'",
      "Guanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, the addiction rate to this drug in the state grew 449% over the past 20 years.",

      "Noticias Telemundo visited the Las Joyas neighborhood in the municipality of Le\u00f3n, where, according to the state\u2019s Security Secretariat, criminal groups have taken over a 380-unit housing complex.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Le\u00f3n right now is demanding and very serious,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cInside those houses there are women, girls, minors, and you see drug trafficking, trafficking of women, trafficking of everything.\"",
      "Most panic houses are in working-class neighborhoods like Las Joyas. According to the state government, there could be up to 60,000 homes across Guanajuato currently being used for illegal drug use.",
      "\u201cIn fact, you can see a panic house on any corner, anywhere. It\u2019s very easy to find them. There are many abandoned houses,\u201d one of the young men interviewed by Noticias Telemundo said.",
      "'I don\u2019t want to be caught again'",
      "According to state figures, at least 10 people have been murdered in panic houses in the last two years, and around 400 neighborhoods in the state are struggling with high crime rates.",
      "\u201cLe\u00f3n is the number one city in terms of drug dealing,\u201d said Juan Mauro Gonz\u00e1lez, Guanajuato\u2019s secretary of security.",
      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",
      "\"The most important thing to rehabilitate people is to change their mindset. They have to say they don\u2019t want that anymore, that they no longer want to suffer or be in that world where they were humiliated, abused, and forced to do things. They should want a different life; we do the rest and we help them,\u201d said Miranda, who said his addiction center has a capacity to serve 150 people.",
      "Meanwhile, young people like the ones interviewed by Noticias Telemundo continue to struggle to avoid falling back into addiction and the dangers of the \"haunted houses\" that abound on some areas of Guanajuato.",

      "Waly said the state's authority to govern is rapidly shrinking as gang control expands with cascading effects. Criminal groups are stepping into the vacuum left by the absence or limited delivery of public services and are establishing \"parallel governance structures,\" and gang control of major trade routes has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for cooking fuel and rice, Haiti's staple food, she said.",
      "U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca told the council \"the ongoing gang encirclement of Port-au-Prince\" and their strengthened foothold in the capital and beyond is \"pushing the situation closer to the brink.\"",
      "\"Without increased action by the international community, the total collapse of state presence in the capital could become a very real scenario,\" he warned."

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 A special tribunal has sentenced Bangladesh\u2019s former leader Sheikh Hasina to six months in jail after she was found in contempt of court for allegedly claiming she had a license to kill at least 227 people.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s sentence was the first in any case against Hasina since she fled to India during a mass uprising last year that toppled her 15-year rule.",
      "The contempt case stemmed from a leaked audio recording of a supposed phone conversation between Hasina and a leader of the student wing of her political party. A person alleged to be Hasina is heard on the audio saying: \u201cThere are 227 cases against me, so I now have a license to kill 227 people.\u201d",
      "The Criminal Investigation Department confirmed the audio\u2019s authenticity through forensic analysis.",
      "The recording showed Hasina\u2019s anger at the charges of murder and numerous other crimes against her under the interim administration of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, who vowed to punish Hasina and her top aides for the deaths of hundreds of people in the uprising against her.",
      "The sentencing by the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal came as a trial against her being held in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity began in June.",
      "The tribunal had ordered Hasina and her former home minister to respond by May 15. When they failed to do so, the tribunal summoned them May 25 to appear in court June 16. Later the tribunal asked for notices to be published in newspapers asking Hasina to appear.",
      "The prosecution said later neither of the suspects appeared before the court or explained their absence through a lawyer. In such circumstances, the tribunal has the authority to issue a sentence under the law.",
      "Hasina and her Awami League party had earlier criticized the tribunal and its prosecution team for their connection with political parties, especially with the Jamaat-e-Islami party.",
      "The Yunus-led government has banned the former ruling Awami League party and amended laws to allow for the party to be prosecuted for its role during the uprising.",
      "In February, the U.N. human rights office estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks in the crackdown on the student-led protests against Hasina, who was the country\u2019s longest serving prime minister.",
      "The tribunal was established by Hasina in 2009 to investigate and try crimes involving Bangladesh\u2019s independence war in 1971. The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war against Pakistan. Aided by India, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father and the country\u2019s first leader."

      "Steve Huen of Hong Kong-based travel agency EGL Tours blamed a flurry of social media predictions tied to a manga that depicts a dream of a massive earthquake and tsunami hitting Japan and neighboring countries in July 2025.",
      "\u201cThe rumors have had a significant impact,\u201d said Huen, adding that his firm had seen its Japan-related business halve. Discounts and the introduction of earthquake insurance had \u201cprevented Japan-bound travel from dropping to zero,\u201d he added.",
      "Hong Kong resident Branden Choi, 28, said he was a frequent traveler to Japan but was hesitant to visit the country during July and August due to the manga prediction.",
      "\u201cIf possible, I might delay my trip and go after September,\u201d he said.",
      "Ryo Tatsuki, the artist behind the manga titled \u201cThe Future I Saw,\u201d first published in 1999 and then re-released in 2021, has tried to dampen the speculation, saying in a statement issued by her publisher that she was \u201cnot a prophet.\u201d",
      "The first edition of the manga warned of a major natural disaster in March 2011. That was the month and year when a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster struck Japan\u2019s northeastern coast, killing thousands.",
      "Some have interpreted the latest edition as predicting a catastrophic event would occur specifically on July 5, 2025, although Tatsuki has denied this.",
      "Situated within the Pacific Ocean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent days, there have been more than 900 earthquakes, most of them small tremors, on islands off the southern tip of Kyushu.",
      "But Robert Geller, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied seismology since 1971, said even scientifically based earthquake prediction was \u201cimpossible.\u201d",
      "\u201cNone of the predictions I\u2019ve experienced in my scientific career have come close at all,\u201d he said.",
      "Nevertheless, low-cost carrier Greater Bay Airlines became the latest Hong Kong airline on Wednesday to cancel flights to Japan due to low demand, saying it would indefinitely suspend its service to Tokushima in western Japan from September.",
      "Serena Peng, 30, a visitor to Tokyo from Seattle, had initially tried to talk her husband out of visiting Japan after seeing the social media speculation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not super worried right now, but I was before,\u201d she said outside Tokyo\u2019s bustling Senso-ji temple."

      "A helicopter and 15 boats searched for survivors with assistance from fishermen and people onshore.",
      "Weather was a significant factor in the search effort. Strong waves up to 6.5 feet high and darkness hampered emergency responders overnight. While conditions improved Thursday morning, Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency indicated waves reached up to 8.2 feet with strong currents and winds Thursday afternoon.",

That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003."
