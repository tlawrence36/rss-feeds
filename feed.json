      "King Charles III has laid a wreath honoring fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on",
      "LONDON -- King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign that the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer.",
      "Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I \u201con the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\u201d in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead.",
      "After the two-minute silence, buglers from the Royal Marines played the \u201cLast Post,\u201d and Charles led the wreath-laying part of the service.",
      "The 75-year-old king, dressed in his Royal Navy uniform of the Admiral of the Fleet, laid a wreath of poppies at the base of the Cenotaph in recognition of the fallen from conflicts dating back to World War I.",
      "His eldest son and the heir to the throne, Prince William, left his own floral tribute \u2014 featuring the Prince of Wales\u2019 feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red.",
      "Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection.",
      "It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be back on occasions like this, but I remember the guys that never came home on my ship when it was torpedoed,\" said 99-year-old Stan Ford, who has had to walk with leg calipers ever since the ship that he was serving on \u2014 HMS Fratton \u2014 was sunk off France's Normandy coast in August 1944 at the cost of 31 lives.",
      "\u201cThey never came home, and I always feel it\u2019s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn\u2019t,\" said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors.",
      "Charles\u2019 ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties.",
      "Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy.",
      "The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties.",
      "Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my wife, I\u2019m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,\u201d William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. \u201cBut from a personal family point of view, it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been brutal.\u201d",
      "While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday.",
      "Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England.",
      "He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cI like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood really. Even if you don\u2019t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.\""

      "That searing 1971 piece made her an international star. But it was truly only the beginning of Jamison\u2019s decades-long career atop modern dance, onstage and off. As Ailey\u2019s hand-picked successor beginning in 1989, she led his namesake company for more than 20 years, helping it become the most successful modern dance troupe in the nation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Jamison, who died Saturday at 81 after a brief illness, reflected in an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, marking the company\u2019s then-60th anniversary. \u201cI find it remarkable that we still exist today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Mr. Ailey would be absolutely beside-himself happy, that something he started 60 years ago could blossom into everything he imagined.\u201d",
      "And likely much more. Jamison brought the company not only continued global exposure and crossover cultural appeal but economic stability and growth, putting it in \u201ca stratosphere that Ailey couldn\u2019t even imagine,\u201d said Wendy Perron, author and former longtime editor of Dance Magazine.",
      "Perron attributes Jamison\u2019s success, in a world when many dance companies struggle to survive, to her unique personality and ability to forge relationships. \u201cThere was a warmth and magnetism about her \u2014 everyone wanted to be with her,\u201d said Perron. \u201cThere was a light shining around her.\u201d",
      "Taking the reins as artistic director upon Ailey\u2019s death at 58, Jamison introduced new works and choreography, but also made sure to keep front and center her predecessor's undisputed masterpiece: \u201cRevelations,\u201d a 1960 classic that has defined the company and powered its success like few others, if any, in the history of dance.",
      "It was in \u201cRevelations,\u201d a telling of Black history through spirituals and blues, that Jamison also made a mark as a dancer, holding a white parasol with one arm as she undulated the rest of her body in a baptismal scene \u2013 \u201cthe umbrella woman,\u201d as the part became known.",
      "To this day, \u201cRevelations\u201d appears on most of the company\u2019s programs, at home in New York and on tour, and is referred to as the most-seen work of modern dance. (It's hard to conceive of anything comparable.) \u201cRevelations\u201d was even performed at the White House, at a dance event hosted by Michelle Obama in 2010, in which the first lady paid tribute to Jamison, calling her \u201can amazing, phenomenal, \u2018fly\u2019 woman.\u201d",
      "Obama also told Jamison from the stage that a photo of her in \u201cCry\u201d had been \u201cthe only piece of art\u201d in the Obamas' home before the White House, and that her daughters, Malia and Sasha, had asked her: \u201cIs that the lady in the picture?\u201d",
      "A year later, retiring as artistic director, Jamison exclaimed to a cheering crowd at New York City Center gathered to honor her: \u201cI have come a long way from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania!\u201d That\u2019s where Jamison was born in 1943 and raised, her childhood spent training in various dance forms, including ballet, modern and tap.",
      "\u201cI knew I had so much energy back then \u2013 just too much for everybody,\u201d she quipped in a 2023 podcast interview. \u201cBut my parents went, \u2018OK, lets direct her this way.\u2019\u201d She credited her mother\u2019s dedication \u2014 she made her daughter\u2019s costumes, and \u201cwould massage my legs when I got home from class.\u201d",
      "In 1964, famed choreographer Agnes de Mille had seen Jamison in a class and brought her to New York to participate in a production of American Ballet Theatre. Soon after, the young dancer went to an audition for a TV special \u2014 and flubbed it, she said. But Ailey was there, and she soon was invited to join his fledgling company.",
      "She wasn\u2019t sure what he saw in her, she has said, other than a look: \u201cSmall head, broad shoulders, long arms and long legs.\u201d",
      "With the young company, Jamison traveled to Europe and Africa. Even then, it took her a few years to appreciate that this could be a career. Partly this was because, as she noted in the 2023 podcast, \u201cWe were getting paid doodly-squat\u201d \u2013 envelopes that sometimes contained a $20 bill, and sometimes just a thank-you note.",
      "But she soon realized that she loved dancing, traveling and being around other dancers. The Ailey troupe was also a rare outlet at the time for Black talent. \u201cThere were no outlets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no place for us to say, \"Hey look, this is our artistry, this is our culture, and guess what else we can do?\u201d",
      "Ailey chose Jamison for \u201cCry\u201d in 1971, a work he dedicated to Black women everywhere, but especially mothers. On opening night, Jamison has said, she didn\u2019t know if she was going to make it though the demanding, 16-minute solo.",
      "She told the Hollywood Reporter that \u201cwhen the curtain went down, I was on the floor.\u201d She got up to take a bow, \u201cand I kept taking bows over and over until I don\u2019t know which number it was, but they were still screaming and yelling.\u201d",
      "Over the next two decades, Jamison often appeared as a guest artist with companies around the world, and left the Ailey troupe in 1980 to star on Broadway in \u201cSophisticated Ladies.\" She also formed her own company, The Jamison Project.",
      "Then an ailing Ailey told her he\u2019d like her to run the company after him.",
      "Jamison recalled, in the AP interview in 2018, being present as Ailey died, along with fellow dancer Sylvia Waters and Ailey\u2019s mother.",
      "\u201cWe were in his room as he passed, and usually you see in movies, that people have their last breath and they breathe out. But Mr. Ailey breathed IN. We expected him to breathe out, and he didn\u2019t. So I think what we\u2019re living on now, is his breath OUT ... that air, that vision, that dream.\u201d",
      "Among her many laurels, Jamison was awarded Kennedy Center Honors in 1999 and a National Medal of the Arts in 2001.",
      "Perron, the former Dance Magazine editor, said she felt Jamison had been overlooked somewhat as a choreographer. She pointed to \u201cA Case of You\u201d \u2014 a duet to Diana Krall\u2019s version of the Joni Mitchell classic and part of Jamison\u2019s 2005 \u201cReminiscin.'\" The duet, Perron said, was \u201chappy and sad and passionate and inventive .. you really believe these people are passionately in love.\u201d",
      "Jamison passed the artistic director baton to choreographer Robert Battle in 2011. Looking back, she has said one of her proudest moments at the company was the creation of the Joan Weill Center for Dance in 2005, a midtown Manhattan home for the company.",
      "\u201cMajestic\u201d and \u201cqueenly\u201d is how Waters, now Ailey II Artistic Director Emerita, described her late colleague.",
      "\u201cShe was a unique, spectacular dancer,\" Waters said. \u201cTo dance with her and to be in her sphere of energy was mesmerizing.\"",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on a popular tourist beach in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, according to a statement from the Western Australia state\u2019s Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.",

      "A healthy male can weigh more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).",
      "The department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the penguin. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that \u201coptions are still being worked through.\u201d",

      "The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday that the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Corporation blasted \u201cBilly And The Epic Escape,\u201d which was published earlier this year, for employing a series of tropes and stereotypes about Indigenous Australians, including their relationships with the natural and spiritual worlds.",
      "The group criticized one of the fantasy novel's subplots, which tells the story of an Indigenous girl living in foster care, for contributing to the \u201cerasure, trivialisation, and stereotyping of First Nations peoples and experiences.\"",

She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history.",
      "\u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is up for album and country album of the year, and \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories.",
      "This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88.",
      "If Beyonc\u00e9 wins the album of the year, she\u2019ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\u201d joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys\u2019 top prize.",

He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership.

When I say right, I mean reflective and representative of what\u2019s happening in music today. So, the work continues.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to a record-breaking 99 nominations. There's an incredible diversity of genres represented across the major categories, and women continue to succeed. So... who didn\u2019t make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let\u2019s take a look.",
      "Country music has bled into other prominent genres and the Recording Academy has taken note. Country hybridists \u2014 like Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone and first-time nominee Shaboozey \u2014 lead many nominations, in country and beyond.",
      "But that means the traditionalists might not see rewards: CMA Awards favorites Cody Johnson\u2019s \u201cLeather\u201d and Luke Combs\u2019 \u201cFathers & Sons\u201d didn\u2019t see any nominations. The latter shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise: Comb\u2019s blockbuster cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for record of the year at the Grammys in 2024, either \u2013 though it did land a nod in best country solo performance.",
      "This year also marks Malone and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first-ever nominations in the country categories.",
      "Who saw this one coming? The Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then,\" is up for record of the year. Released in 2023, the song utilized artificial intelligence to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo. It's the same technology used to separate the Beatles\u2019 voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary series, \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\u201d",
      "Last summer, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards, including new protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning. It sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music. At the 2025 Grammys, clearly, those changes are in action.",
      "Last year's album of the year category was dominated by pop women \u2014 and that continues, with Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX's rave-ready approach to the genre receiving noms. The latter is a nice surprise (more on that below), but the two men nominated are creative outliers. OutKast frontman Andr\u00e9 3000's experimental jazz-flute album \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a contender, as well as Jacob Collier's \u201cDjesse Vol. 4,\u201d though that one may fulfill a space left vacant by Jon Batiste.",
      "Charli XCX, having never received a solo artist nomination at the Grammys, is up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those include record and album of the year, as well as pop solo and pop duo/group performance, pop dance recording, dance/electronic album and music video. Clearly, her culture-shifting \u201cBRAT\u201d album \u2014 and the summer of memes it inspired \u2014 has continued to hold real influence.",
      "There is no shortage of first-time nominees this year. Some were expected \u2014 like Roan, Carpenter and Shaboozey \u2014 others less so. Willow Smith has received her first nomination in the arrangement, instruments and vocals category for arranging her song \u201cb i g f e e l i n g s.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black woman musician in country, is featured alongside Shaboozey on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII,\" which is up for the melodic rap performance category. That delivers the progenitor her first-ever Grammy nomination at age 83.",
      "And lastly, Morgan Wallen \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most popular musicians in the country, and one rife with controversy \u2014 has received his first two Grammy nominations for his feature on Malone's \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d Last year, his song \u201cLast Night\u201d was nominated for best country song, but that is a songwriter\u2019s award, and Wallen did not receive a nod.",
      "In the past, the country singer has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Just like last year, Latin music is missing from the top categories at the 2025 Grammys, despite a surplus of eligible talent: Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201c\u00c9xodo,\" Shakira\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\u201d Residente, \u201cLas Letras Ya No Importan,\" Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's \u201cBoca Chueca, Vol. 1\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d among them.",
      "Same as above: K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across its career.",
      "Despite being one of the great global superstars of the current moment \u2014 regularly celebrated as one of the most streamed artists on the planet \u2014 Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d received only one nomination, for m\u00fasica urbana album.",
      "And Usher, who had a blockbuster year \u2014 including a star-studded Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 also received only one nomination, for R&B album.",
      "In pop, Dua Lipa's \u201cEternal Optimism\" is nowhere to be seen. In country, best new artist hopeful Megan Moroney received no nominations. In R&B, Normani's long-awaited debut album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d failed to make waves with voters, and in rap, Nicki Minaj's \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d and Megan Thee Stallion's \u201cMegan\u201d are absent.",
      "Last year, Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. This year, he didn't receive a nod in that category \u2014 one he has held a place in since 2019. Who will take the mantle?",

      "A father and daughter disabled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 have been awarded $58,000 against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax",
      "LONDON -- A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed.",
      "Hall, an independent producer, had claimed \u201cmillions of people have bought a lie\u201d about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest.",
      "Justice Karen Steyn called Hall\u2019s conduct a \u201cnegligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.\" She said he used the \u201cflimsiest of analytical techniques\u201d to dismiss \"the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.\u201d",
      "Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with \u201cdeep psychological injuries,\u201d police said.",
      "Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage.",
      "The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000).",
      "The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money.",
      "\u201cWhat this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\" he said outside court.",
      "Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court."

      "The first episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live\" since the election of Donald Trump struck a somber tone at the beginning",
      "The first \u201cSaturday Night Live\" since Donald Trump's election victory began with the most somber of tones as a group of plainly dressed cast members, primarily women and minorities, described their new reality.",
      "\u201cTo many people, including many people watching right now, the results were shocking and even horrifying,\u201d Ego Nwodim soberly said.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump, who forcibly tried to overturn the results of the last election, was returned to office,\u201d Heidi Gardner said.",
      "\u201cAnd now,\" Bowen Yang added, \"thanks to the Supreme Court, there are no guardrails.\u201d",
      "Then came the swerve from the liberal-leaning show.",
      "\u201cThat is why we at \u2018SNL\u2019 would like to say to Donald Trump, we have been with you all along,\" Keenan Thompson said.",
      "Yang chimed in, \u201cWe have never wavered in our support for you, even when others doubted you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery single person on this stage believed in you,\u201d Sarah Sherman said.",
      "Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez added, \u201cEvery single person on this stage voted for you.\u201d",
      "The cast members went on to effusively declare their reverence for, and obedience to, the former and future president, introducing a new character, \u201cHot, Jacked Trump.\u201d",
      "Cast member James Austin Johnson, who plays a dead-on Trump and was virtually guaranteed a long-term job by the election, came out as an Adonis-bodied president-elect.",
      "\u201cFrom now on we\u2019re going to do a very flattering portrayal of Trump, because frankly he\u2019s my hero,\" Johnson said in his Trump voice but speaking as himself. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make an incredible president and eventually king.\u201d",
      "The episode, hosted by standup comic and actor Bill Burr, was the first all season that did not begin with former cast member Maya Rudolph, who played Vice President Kamala Harris in a giddy five-week run culminating with an appearance last week of Harris herself that began the show's 50th season and brought a ratings spike.",
      "Burr, hosting after standup Dave Chappelle hosted the last two post-presidential election episodes, did his own feint in his monologue, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t watch politics\u201d and doing some standard standup including an airplane bit before doubling back to the elephant in the studio, the election.",
      "\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get to what you all want to talk about. Alright ladies, you\u2019re 0-and-2 against this guy,\" he said. \"But you learn more from your losses than your wins. So let\u2019s get into the game tape. Ladies, enough with the pantsuit. Okay, it\u2019s not working. Stop trying to have respect for yourself.\u201d",
      "He suggested candidates that were a least a little more scantily clad, saying, \u201cI know a lot of ugly women \u2014 feminists, I mean \u2014 don\u2019t want to hear this message.\u201d",
      "Burr was \u201cso psyched that this stupid election is finally over. Everybody knew who they were going to vote for four years ago. Then they just dragged us through a year and a half of this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "After Trump's first election victory in 2016, the show opening was serious and stayed that way with Kate McKinnon, who played Hillary Clinton on the show, appearing as the losing candidate sitting at the piano and singing a somber version Leonard Cohen's \u201cHallelujah,\u201d changing only one verse from the best-known versions of the song.",
      "\u201cAnd even though it all went wrong, I'll stand before the lord of song with nothing on my tongue but \u2018Hallelujah,'\u201d McKinnon sang in what became a national moment of catharsis for those on the losing side.",
      "After finishing, McKinnon said in a shaky voice, \u201cI'm not giving up and neither should you\" before delivering the obligatory \u201clive from New York, it's Saturday night!\u201d",

      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",
      "Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita described her as a \u201cgossip columnist\u201d in a post on the social media site X. Palmeri told Williams she had accurately reported some anxiety within the Trump camp about who was voting early.",
      "Neither Axios nor Politico would immediately confirm reports that some of their reporters were similarly banned, and the Trump campaign did not immediately return a call for comment.",

      "After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O\u2019Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.",
      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\"When I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "Now, O\u2019Brien said she can get back out in public \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi on chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",
      "\u201cI got my life back,\u201d O\u2019Brien said."

      "LONDON -- The World Health Organization said mpox cases in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d even as the virus continues to increase in other regions of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "In a report Monday, the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged, however, that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox; the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources to stop the virus in Africa, it could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the mpox outbreak in Burundi is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox, which was previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys, is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO also said it would convene an expert meeting next Monday to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes that day in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoudeh, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoudeh spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoudeh said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on whether a law that legislators adopted more than a decade before the Civil War bans abortion and can still be enforced",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Monday on whether a law that legislators adopted more than a decade before the Civil War bans abortion and can still be enforced.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates stand an excellent chance of prevailing, given that liberal justices control the court and one of them remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights. Monday's arguments are little more than a formality ahead of a ruling, which is expected to take weeks.",
      "Wisconsin lawmakers passed the state's first prohibition on abortion in 1849. That law stated that anyone who killed a fetus unless the act was to save the mother's life was guilty of manslaughter. Legislators passed statutes about a decade later that prohibited a woman from attempting to obtain her own miscarriage. In the 1950s, lawmakers revised the law's language to make killing an unborn child or killing the mother with the intent of destroying her unborn child a felony. The revisions allowed a doctor in consultation with two other physicians to perform an abortion to save the mother's life.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide nullified the Wisconsin ban, but legislators never repealed it. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe two years ago, conservatives argued that the Wisconsin ban was enforceable again.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that allows abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, argues the 1849 ban should be enforceable. He contends that it was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the old ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother's consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper's ruling without waiting for lower appellate courts to rule first. The court agreed to take the case in July.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The court agreed in July to take that case as well. The justices have yet to schedule oral arguments.",
      "Persuading the court's liberal majority to uphold the ban appears next to impossible. Liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz stated openly during her campaign that she supports abortion rights, a major departure for a judicial candidate. Usually, such candidates refrain from speaking about their personal views to avoid the appearance of bias.",
      "The court's three conservative justices have accused the liberals of playing politics with abortion."

      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

    "summary": "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
    "story": [
      "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.",
      "They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button.",
      "\u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the Susan B. Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that",
      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that.",
      "Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors.",
      "The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk.",
      "The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems \u2014 eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain.",
      "Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. \u201cOur world is stacked against us,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:",
      "A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death.",
      "Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association.",
      "The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood.",
      "Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check.",
      "Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke.",
      "Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2014 or some combination \u2014 per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home.",
      "Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.",
      "The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.",
      "But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital.",
      "The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office because of transportation issues or they can\u2019t get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,\" Bushnell said.",
      "Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership.",
      "The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.",
      "Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.",

Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected.

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia said Thursday that he is battling esophageal cancer",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat representing Virginia's most populous county in Congress, said Thursday that he is battling esophageal cancer.",
      "The announcement comes after Connolly, 74, handily won his ninth House term on Tuesday by defeating Republican Mike Van Meter, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, in Virginia's 11th District.",
      "\u201cI will attack this the only way I know how \u2013 with Irish fight and humor,\u201d Connolly said in a statement.",
      "As he enters his new term representing Fairfax County and the wealthy suburbs outside Washington, the congressman will be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, he said. In his statement, Connolly said he had no symptoms besides occasional abdominal aches.",
      "\u201cMy wonderful staff and I look forward to serving you all in this new term and in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "The congressman has been a fixture in northern Virginia politics for roughly 30 years after he was first elected as a Fairfax County supervisor in 1995. In Congress, he has played a leading role in oversight investigations.",
      "His tenure as a congressman has not been without hardship. Last year, a man with a history of mental illness went to Connolly's Fairfax, Virginia, district office looking to kill him with a baseball bat. Connolly wasn\u2019t there, so the man, who a judge had since found not guilty by reason of insanity, attacked two staffers.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",

      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "\u201cIt was an audacious plan to murder a man in plain sight and you very nearly succeeded,\u201d Justice Christina Lambert said. \u201cYou were certainly obsessed by money and more particularly, the money to which you considered yourself entitled.\"",
      "Kwan, 53, pleaded guilty last month in Newcastle Crown Court to attempted murder.",
      "O\u2019Hara, 72, survived after being in intensive care for several weeks and having part of his arm cut away to prevent the necrotizing fasciitis from spreading.",
      "The ordeal left him \u201ca shell of an individual,\u201d he said. O'Hara and Kwan's mother, Jenny Leung, have since split up.",
      "Police used surveillance camera footage to track down Kwan.",
      "They found he had hatched an elaborate plot by sending fake letters with National Health Service logos, hyperlinks and even a QR code to offer a home visit for a COVID booster to O'Hara. Kwan disguised himself in head-to-toe protective gear, tinted glasses and a surgical mask and drove a vehicle to the appointment in January using fake license plates.",
      "Kwan, who was described as having a morbid obsession with poisons, used iodomethane, a substance found in pesticides that he thought would be difficult for medics to detect, the judge said.",
      "Police found arsenic, liquid mercury and castor beans, which can be used to make the chemical weapon ricin, during a search of his home. He had instructions on how to make ricin on his computer.",
      "The judge said Kwan was upset about getting a smaller share of his inheritance when his father died. He had a strained relationship with his mother, and learned that she had a provision in her will that would allow O'Hara to stay in her home if she died before him.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched supreme court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court, which struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in October and is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state supreme court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel\u2019s help in the police investigation. He met on Saturday with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and said in a statement that the attacks and demands to show passports \u201cwere reminiscent of dark periods in history.\u201d"

      "LONDON -- A children's book written by British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has been withdrawn from sale after it was criticized for causing offense to Indigenous Australians.",
      "The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday that the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Corporation blasted \u201cBilly And The Epic Escape,\u201d which was published earlier this year, for employing a series of tropes and stereotypes about Indigenous Australians, including their relationships with the natural and spiritual worlds.",
      "The group criticized one of the fantasy novel's subplots, which tells the story of an Indigenous girl living in foster care, for contributing to the \u201cerasure, trivialisation, and stereotyping of First Nations peoples and experiences.\"",
      "In a statement, Oliver, 49, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d to have caused offense and apologized \u201cwholeheartedly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue,\" he said. \"Together with my publishers we have decided to withdraw the book from sale.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that and take decisive action,\u201d the publisher said. \"With that in mind, we have agreed with our author, Jamie Oliver, that we will be withdrawing the book from sale.\u201d",

      "The head of the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog says he will travel to Iran in the coming days to hold talks regarding the country\u2019s nuclear program",
      "VIENNA -- The head of the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog said Sunday he will travel to Iran in the coming days to hold talks regarding the country's nuclear program. The visit comes amid wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war and uncertainty over how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will approach Iran after his inauguration in January.",
      "Specifically, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mariano Grossi, will have high level meetings with the Iranian government and will hold technical discussions on all aspects related to the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023.",
      "It is intended as a path forward for cooperation between the IAEA and Iran on how to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic\u2019s rapidly advancing atomic program.",
      "The 2023 statement included a pledge by Iran to resolve issues around sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \u201cimplement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\u201d",
      "The meetings in Tehran will build on Grossi's discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, a statement by the IAEA said.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that we make substantive progress in the implementation of the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023,\" Grossi said. \u201cMy visit to Tehran will be very important in that regard.\u201d",
      "Iran is rapidly advancing its atomic program and continues to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels in defiance of international demands, according to recent reports by the IAEA.",
      "Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran\u2019s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers had put limits on its nuclear program \u2014 which the West fears could be used for making nuclear weapons although Tehran insists is only for peaceful purposes \u2014 while lifting punitive economic sanctions imposed on Iran.",
      "But the deal collapsed after the Trump administration in 2018 pulled the United States out of the agreement, leading Iran to abandon all limits the deal had put on its program and enrich uranium to up to 60% purity.",
      "That is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA\u2019s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible.",
      "As Trump is to take office again in a few weeks, Iranians are divided on what his next presidency will bring. Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America\u2019s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea.",

      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes that day in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoudeh, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoudeh spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoudeh said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d"

      "BEIJING -- BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Indonesia's new leader called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of $10 billion in new deals at a business forum on Sunday in the Chinese capital before heading to the U.S.",
      "President Prabowo Subianto told the forum that his country wants to be part of China's emergence as not only an economic but also a \u201ccivilizational power.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration \u2014 not confrontation \u2014 is the way for peace and prosperity,\u201d he said.",
      "Subianto wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to Washington \u2014 where the U.S. government is confronting China\u2019s rise \u2014 and then to Peru and Brazil for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits.",
      "He and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed Saturday to deepen ties, elevating security to a fifth \u201cpillar\u201d of cooperation in addition to political, economic, maritime and people-to-people exchange. They agreed to hold a first-ever joint meeting of their foreign and defense ministers in 2025, a joint statement said.",
      "\u201cIndonesia is very clear,\" Subianto said. \"We have always been nonaligned, we have always been respectful of all great powers in the world.\u201d",
      "Indonesia has remained on the periphery of the territorial disputes between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea. It doesn\u2019t have a formal dispute with Beijing though Indonesia said its patrol ships repeatedly drove a Chinese coast guard vessel away from an Indonesian energy company vessel conducting a seismic survey less than a month ago.",
      "Chinese companies have invested heavily in mining in Indonesia, as they have elsewhere in the world. China also helped build Indonesia's first high-speed railway, a 142-kilometer (88-mile) route between Jakarta and Bandung that opened last year.",
      "But a flood of low-priced Chinese products has hit Indonesia's garment makers hard, shuttering factories and prompting calls for import tariffs. The government has sought to placate domestic producers while not angering the country\u2019s biggest trading partner.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A new typhoon barreled across an agricultural region in the northeastern Philippines on Monday after thousands were evacuated to safety while still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by three successive storms in the last three weeks.",
      "Typhoon Toraji slammed into northeastern Aurora province and was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. \u2014 just the day before \u2014 inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents in Cagayan and Ilocos provinces. Marcos skipped this week\u2019s Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms.",
      "After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea.",
      "Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said.",
      "\"We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,\u201d Remulla told reporters.",
      "The military said its disaster-response forces have been deployed near high-risk areas and were standing by for new contingencies. It added that it suspended combat drills in the north due to the weather.",

      "Schools were shut down, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were suspended in provinces in or near the path of the typhoon, the 14th weather disturbance to batter the Philippine archipelago this year. Forecasters said they were monitoring another brewing storm in the Pacific that could affect the country if it strengthens.",
      "The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months\u2019 worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns.",
      "Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces.",
      "The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world.",
      "In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines."

      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Yiannis Boutaris, a winemaker who served two terms as mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second largest city, and shook its conservative image, died Saturday evening, his company Kir-Yianni announced on social media.",
      "No cause of death was given, but his health had been declining. A couple weeks ago he had undergone a hip operation, was discharged but readmitted to hospital a few days before his death.",
      "The announcement, written by his two sons, who run the winemaking company, called him \u201clarger than life, visionary, charismatic, innovator, maverick.\u201d Maverick he undoubtedly was.",
      "Politicians across the spectrum paid tribute to Boutaris, emphasizing his passionate and non-conformist personality.",
      "Boutaris, a progressive man who eschewed party labels, was involved in local politics late in life, being elected municipal councilor at age 60. He first ran for mayor in 2006, coming third, before running a successful campaign in 2010. His supporters ranged from leftists to moderate conservatives, and he won by a whisker in a city where hardline conservatives had held the mayor\u2019s office for 24 years. In 2014, he won reelection with 58% of the vote.",

He invited Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of what was then The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to dinner on New Year\u2019s Day 2017, paving the way for an agreement between the countries that ended a decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia, and after which Greece\u2019s northern neighbor adopted the name North Macedonia. He also emphasized the city\u2019s strong Jewish heritage, playing an important role in building the Holocaust Museum.",
      "These moves were sometimes resented by the city\u2019s nationalist element, including the Orthodox Church. Boutaris did not shy from confrontation, leading the city\u2019s archbishop, Anthimos, to name-call him during a church service in October 2010, telling him that without the Church\u2019s support he could not hope to be elected mayor. Nineteen days later, he was.",
      "In May 2018, a gang of nationalists attacked Boutaris, slightly injuring him. Nine persons, including a police officer, were convicted for the attack five years later.",
      "\u201cMy views on gay pride and North Macedonia caused great enmity and personal hatred,\u201d he had said in an interview.",
      "Before he delved into politics, Boutaris had made his name in the winemaking business founded by his grandfather. Business differences with his brother led him to quit the family business in 1996 and start his own, Kir-Yianni (\u201cMr. Yiannis\u201d) winery.",
      "Boutaris was also an active environmentalist, founding an NGO, Arktouros, initially aiming to protect the country\u2019s brown bears, but whose sanctuary eventually took on many other species. He was also involved in his beloved Aris Thessaloniki sports club. The club\u2019s professional basketball team said he was a major provider of funds during the club\u2019s golden era in the 1980s and 1990s.",

      "U.S. researchers have concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "Bangkok -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country\u2019s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \u201cblue-water\u201d force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States.",
      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered.",
      "The modernization aligns with China\u2019s \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\u201d for its navy \u201cto operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China\u2019s military.",
      "Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship.",
      "The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies.",
      "The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship.\u201d as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: C ross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \u2018safe third country\u2019 agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d",

      "The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as...",
      "LONDON -- The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found that he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.",
      "Some members of the General Synod, the church\u2019s national assembly, have started a petition calling on Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to step down, saying he had \u201clost the confidence of his clergy.\u201d The petition had garnered more than 1,800 signatures on Change.org by late morning London time on Monday.",
      "Calls for Welby\u2019s resignation have grown since Thursday, when the church released the results of an independent review into John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa over five decades.",
      "The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Welby last week took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been after he learned of the abuse, but said he had decided not to resign.",
      "On Monday, his office issued a statement reiterating Welby\u2019s \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 \u2014 and therefore, having reflected, he does not intend to resign,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe hopes the Makin Review supports the ongoing work of building a safer church here and around the world.\u201d",
      "Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",
      "Between 1984 and 2001, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe and subsequently relocated to South Africa. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018.",
      "Smyth\u2019s abuse wasn\u2019t made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.",
      "The Makin Review found that if Smyth had been reported to police in 2013, it could have helped to uncover the truth, prevented further abuse and led to a possible criminal conviction.",
      "\u201cIn effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,\u201d the review found.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries. He is considered first among equals with respect to the communion\u2019s other primates.",

      "This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using \u201call means\u201d if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War.",
      "Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific.",
      "Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following \u201chuman wave\u201d attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses.",
      "However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow\u2019s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.",
      "According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying \u201can extraordinary price\u201d for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine\u2019s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,\u201d he said. But he added that they were \u201ctiny increments of land,\u201d and Moscow\u2019s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.",
      "Radakin insisted that Ukraine\u2019s Western partners should stand by it for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.",
      "On Sunday, the Kremlin\u2019s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump\u2019s upcoming presidency, saying: \u201cAt least he talks about peace. \u2026 He does not talk about confrontation.\u201d",

      "The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn\u2019t held democratic elections in years in a large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation.",

But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille. Organizations like the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition, according to The Miami Herald.",
      "The process suffered another blow in October when three members on the council faced corruption accusations, from anti-corruption investigators alleging that they demanded $750,000 in bribes from a government bank director to secure his job.",

      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "Rivals of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in the capital",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Rivals of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, seen as a potential first effort to make a comeback on the streets since she fled the country in August amid a mass uprising.",
      "The rally in Dhaka by Hasina\u2019s party was to commemorate the death of a party activist on Nov. 10, 1987, which had sparked a mass protest against former military dictator H.M. Ershad. He was eventually ousted from office, ending his nine-year rule in 1990.",
      "The day is commemorated as \u201cdemocracy day.\u201d In 1991, Bangladesh switched to a parliamentary democracy from a presidential form of government, and since then Hasina and her rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, became the most powerful political figures in the country.",
      "On Sunday, activists of the party headed by Zia, Hasina\u2019s main rival, and also members of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party took to the streets of Dhaka, filling up much of the area where the rally was scheduled to take place.",
      "Others, including hundreds of student protesters, also announced that they wouldn't allow Hasina\u2019s supporters to stand on the streets and hold the rally. The protesters said that they think Hasina\u2019s party was trying to make a comeback by holding a rally on the streets on Sunday. The protesters from the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, a group that led the mass uprising in July-August, aggressively hunted for supporters of Hasina.",
      "Groups of people surrounded the Awami League party\u2019s headquarters near the Noor Hossain Square in Dhaka where Hasina\u2019s supporters were supposed to gather to hold the rally.",
      "Security was tight in the area, but witnesses and local media said that the protesters attacked several supporters of Hasina when they attempted to reach there and chanted slogans in favor of the fallen leader.",
      "The Awami League party said that many of their activists were detained by police as they came under attacks.",
      "Tensions ran high throughout Sunday with the anti-Hasina protesters saying that they wouldn't allow the party to hold any public rally under any circumstances. The Awami League party questioned the notion, saying it is against the spirit of democracy and the constitutional right to assembly.",
      "The Awami League party posted a number of videos on Facebook on Sunday showing its supporters being manhandled. Its party headquarters had earlier been vandalized following Hasina\u2019s fall on Aug. 5, and on Sunday it was empty and there were signs of destruction. Outside, control was in the hands of Hasina\u2019s opponents.",
      "The political chaos in the South Asian nation went on as Zia\u2019s party was seeking quick reforms and a new election from an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. The party believes it will be able to form the new government in the absence of Hasina\u2019s party, while its other allies are also struggling.",
      "As the interim government ends its three months in office, people remain concerned over high commodity prices, law and order, mob justice and the rise of Islamist forces once suppressed by Hasina's regime. The international community also remains wary about alleged attacks on minority groups, especially Hindus that make up about 8% of the country's 170 million people.",
      "The Yunus-led government said it would seek extradition of Hasina and her close associates as they face charges of crimes against humanity involving deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.",
      "On Sunday, Bangladesh\u2019s Law Adviser Asif Nazrul said the interim government would ask Interpol to issue red notices seeking the arrest and repatriation of fugitives allegedly responsible for the deaths of people during the mass uprising.",
      "\u201cWe will \u2026 prioritize bringing them back from wherever they are hiding,\u201d he told reporters in Dhaka."

      "The annual event named by the numeric form of its Nov. 11 date was started by e-commerce platform Alibaba, which offered attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend big. The extravaganza has since expanded to other platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo in China as well as abroad.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. The festival has also traditionally been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",

      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in Xi\u2019an city, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trust Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchant tend to raise the usual price of a product before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal.",

      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts that the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",

      "Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba, which operates e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, previously used to publish the value of transactions made during the festival, but have since stopped revealing the total figure. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Merchants who typically take part in the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festivals say the costs of participation no longer pay off, amid high advertising fees and unsatisfactory sales.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying advertising costs to e-commerce platforms he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said that overall sales in the past year have fallen 15% as consumers downgraded and reduced consumption.",

      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world",
      "As climate change leads to a seemingly endless stream of weather disasters around the world, countries are struggling to adapt to the new reality. Preparing to better withstand hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires will take hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "And then there is confronting the root cause of climate change \u2014 the burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil \u2014 by transitioning to clean energies like wind and solar.",
      "That will take trillions of dollars.",
      "Enter climate finance, a term for how to pay for projects to adapt to and combat the cause of climate change. It's especially important for developing countries, which don't have the same resources or access to credit that rich countries do.",
      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world. Called multilateral development banks because they get contributions from various countries, there are only a handful of these banks in the world, the World Bank the largest among them.",
      "The banks were a key reason why, in 2022, the world met a goal countries had set in 2009 to supply developing nations with $100 billion annually to address climate change.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate conference that opens Monday in Azerbaijan, global leaders are expected to discuss how to generate trillions of dollars for climate finance. The nonprofit research group Climate Policy Initiative estimates the world needs about five times the current annual amount of climate financing to limit warming to 1.5 C (2.7 degrees F) since the late 1800s. Currently, global average temperatures are about 1.3 C (2.3 degrees F) higher.",
      "A new goal needs to reach higher and hold institutions and governments accountable to their promises, said Tim Hirschel-Burns, an expert at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.",
      "\"The core of it is getting a goal that is going to catalyze the actions that fills the really significant climate finance gap,\u201d he said.",
      "The debate has also shifted to the question of where the money will come from, said Dharshan Wignarajah, director of Climate Policy Initiative\u2019s London-based office.",
      "\u201cUltimately it comes down to who pays,\u201d said Wignarajah, who helped lead the climate talks, called the Conference of Parties, when the United Kingdom was host in 2021. \u201cThat has forced finance to be ever-more prominent at the COP discussions.\u201d",
      "Developing nations are much more reliant on these banks for financing climate projects than industrialized countries.",
      "In the U.S. and Canada, commercial banks and corporations provided funding for more than half of climate-friendly projects in 2022, according to Climate Policy Initiative. In sub-Saharan Africa, those private lenders only accounted for 7%.",
      "This is because it is harder for developing countries to get low interest rates.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Kenya, and you want to borrow from private lenders, they might charge you 10% interest rates because your credit rating isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hirschel-Burns said.",
      "But the multilateral banks have better credit ratings than many countries do. For example, the International Development Association \u2014 an arm of the World Bank and the top international aid provider to Kenya \u2014 has the highest possible rating from Moody\u2019s Investor Service, while Kenya itself has a junk rating.",
      "The banks borrow money with that better rating, then lend to developing countries in turn, offering a more reasonable rate than governments could get if they borrowed directly from private lenders.",
      "The multilateral banks\u2019 development seek to improve people's health and the environment, expand energy access and end poverty. It means the banks have also provided billions of dollars for fossil fuel power plants, according to an AP analysis, though their policies have improved and fewer such projects have been funded in recent years.",
      "Investment in fossil fuels continues to rise worldwide, reaching $1.1 trillion in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. And multilateral banks continue to rank among the biggest funders of fossil fuel-prolonging projects, helping to \u201clock in a high-carbon pathway\u201d for countries, according to a report by the Clean Air Fund, which lobbies for the funding of projects to improve air quality.",
      "\u201cIt should be assisting countries to leapfrog,\u201d said Jane Burston, CEO of the Clean Air Fund, referring to the idea that developing countries could industrialize with renewable energy and skip over development that rich nations historically made with fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cIt's baffling why development assistance is being given to something that continues to make people unhealthy as well as harms the planet,\u201d she added.",
      "For example, an arm of the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loaned $105 million toward rehabilitating coal plants in India, with their last loans toward the project going out in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "However, the improvements made coal plants more efficient and reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, according to project documents.",
      "The Clean Air Fund's report estimated the World Bank provided $2.7 billion in \u201cfossil fuel prolonging finance\u201d between 2018 and 2022. During that time, the bank also loaned about 32 times the amount for renewables.",
      "\"Renewable energy support is always our first choice as we work to provide access to electricity,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The bank's policies still \u201cselectively support natural gas as a transition fuel\u201d if its research shows the project is low risk to the climate, the spokesperson said. The bank's recent policies require vetting for every project to make sure its investments reduce climate impacts.",
      "The World Bank delivered $42.6 billion in climate finance in its most recent fiscal year, a 10% increase from the year before. And at the most recent COP, the bank promised nearly half of its lending will soon go toward climate finance.",
      "In Vietnam, about half of power generation comes from fossil fuels, primarily coal power. The Asian Development Bank loaned about $900 million on coal in Vietnam, with their spending on the fossil fuel in the country ending in 2017. The bank's updated climate policies \u201cwill not support coal mining, processing, storage, and transportation, nor any new coal-fired power generation,\u201d it said in a statement. The bank put $9.8 billion toward climate finance in 2023, and aims to finance $100 billion in climate-friendly projects between 2019 and 2030.",
      "The country\u2019s biggest growth area for energy is in wind. The Global Energy Monitor ranks Vietnam seventh in the world in planned wind power. And the Asian Development Bank committed about $60 million in loans toward wind energy in Vietnam between 2021 and 2022.",
      "The banks have made broad commitments in recent years to align with the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. But those promises leave pathways open to continue funding fossil fuels, said Bronwen Tucker, global public finance co-manager at Oil Change International.",
      "According to the group's monitoring of the banks' commitments, all nine of the major banks tracked can fund gas projects in at least some cases.",
      "\u201cThe MDBs can't be climate bankers if they are still fossil bankers,\" she said. \u201cRelying on banks that are locking in fossil fuels and the worst-ever debt crisis is not working.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: C ross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \u2018safe third country\u2019 agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d"

      "The annual event named by the numeric form of its Nov. 11 date was started by e-commerce platform Alibaba, which offered attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend big. The extravaganza has since expanded to other platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo in China as well as abroad.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. The festival has also traditionally been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out on purchases during the shopping extravaganza.",

While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Merchants who typically take part in the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festivals say the costs of participation no longer pay off, amid high advertising fees and unsatisfactory sales.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying advertising costs to e-commerce platforms he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said that overall sales in the past year have fallen 15% as consumers downgraded and reduced consumption.",
      "Du said that while he still takes part in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions, the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of sluggish sales.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us to maintain our leading sales position,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have also turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell globally with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, Alibaba said.",

      "Many veterans who\u2019ve started small businesses tell a similar story: Their military service prepared them mentally for the task, but they were at a disadvantage when it came to the financial part",
      "NEW YORK -- Many veterans who\u2019ve started small businesses tell a similar story: Their military service prepared them mentally for the task, but they were at a disadvantage when it came to the financial part.",
      "\u201cVetrepreneurs\u201d \u2013 veterans that start small businesses or startups -- own nearly 2 million small businesses that employ 5.5 million people in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration. They take in about $1.3 trillion in revenue annually. Their numbers have shrunk, however, as the veteran population has aged. In a 2023 report, the SBA found veteran ownership declined from 11% of businesses in 2014 to 8.1% in 2020.",
      "Veterans enter the business world prepared with skills they gain in the field like leadership and problem-solving. But they haven\u2019t had a chance to build up credit or savings that civilians have had more time to do. That can cause problems because banks use that information to approve loans. Not to mention the mental toll it takes to transition from the military life to civilian life.",
      "According to data from business coaching nonprofit SCORE, about a third of veteran businesses have limited access to capital or lack of financing. That compares to a quarter of non-veteran-owned firms.",
      "SCORE CEO Bridget Weston says the good news is that veterans have plenty of places to turn to for help. Those include nonprofit organizations aimed at getting them on their feet and building up financial literacy, veteran-only loans and grants, and contracts earmarked for veteran owned and disabled veteran owned small businesses.",
      "The place that many start is the Small Business Administration, which offers a program to get certified as a veteran-owned or disabled veteran-owned small business, which can make it easier to get certain loans and federal contracts.",
      "That\u2019s the route Jackson Dalton decided to take when he started Black Box Safety, a maker of personal protective equipment, in 2017. Dalton enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 2000 and was selected for the prestigious Marine Corps Special Operations. But a badly broken leg, suffered during training, eventually forced him medically retire after two years of active duty.",
      "Although the transition back to civilian life was difficult, Dalton went on to get a master\u2019s degree in public health, and spent 10 years working in the health and safety industry. When he ventured out on his own, he decided to focus on federal contracts and got certified by the SBA. He thought prisons would be a good place to start since 3% of their contracts go to disabled veteran businesses. His first contract was selling gloves to a prison in Minnesota. Today, he serves major clients like the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State of California.",
      "Dalton credits his military training with his success.",
      "\u201cThe skills and attributes that I picked up in the military were resilience and grit and the ability to adapt, improvise, overcome when you know, when encountering resistance or obstacles and barriers,\u201d he said.",
      "Veteran focused nonprofits can be another key place to look for help.",
      "Adam Isch, a Marine Corp. veteran who served two tours in Iraq, worked with nonprofit Warrior Rising in Salt Lake City, to find a mentor to help him start his business, Isch Body Works in Fort Worth, Texas, which sells men\u2019s hygiene products. The business donates part of its revenue to charities supporting Texas children in foster care and awaiting adoption. Similar nonprofits include Bunker Labs, Tactical Launch, and others around the country.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to start a business, especially a veteran, go find a group like a Warrior Rising, there are all kinds of different groups like that getting mentorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are doing what you do. They\u2019re doing what I do, and they love it and they want to talk about it.\"",
      "For some, a veteran-earmarked loan can be what makes or breaks a business. Elizabeth Gore, the co-founder and President of Hello Alice, a financial technology firm that works with small businesses on getting funding, including 117,000 military small business owners. \u201cThey have to really struggle more than other groups and demographics on access to capital,\u201d she said.",
      "John Griveas in Buffalo, N.Y. spent two years as a Navy Seal in the mid-1990s and his remaining four years in New York in the active reserves, ending his tenure in 2002. After that he \u201cbounced around\u201d different jobs and spent 10 years in the local collections industry.",
      "But in 2014 he met his current partner, Jackie, and decided her hobby of making all-natural dog treats could be a real business. They formed Fetch! Dog Treats as an LLC in 2015 and today they sell their treats at about 300 independently owned mom and pop brick and mortar stores, news shops, banks and even the Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas strip.",
      "For himself and other veterans he\u2019s talked to, one of the biggest challenges they face is getting funds. He found a $10,000 grant via the FedEx Entrepreneur Fund, which partners with Hello Alice to give grants to small businesses owned by military veterans. It came at a pivotal time, when his landlord decided to redevelop his space and gave him only a few months to find a new location.",
      "\u201cIt was something that quite literally was going to end us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when that grant came through, it was literally a lifesaver for us.\u201d",
      "He advised other veterans to take advantage of veteran resources.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tons of resources out there,\u201d he said. \"Whatever it might be that you know, just helps you get through the day-to-day, because there\u2019s a lot involved with running a business.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "California farmers have been devoting more land to pistachios, which are seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation",
      "LOST HILLS, Calif. -- In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world.",
      "Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world\u2019s top exporter of the nut.",
      "\u201cThere has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,\u201d said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. \u201cYou are starting to see the fruit of people\u2019s vision from 40 years ago.\u201d",
      "California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.",
      "Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted.",
      "The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.",
      "Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be be prepped for sale.",
      "\"There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,\" Yraceburu said. \u201cThe world wants more.\u201d",
      "Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.",
      "Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said.",
      "Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.",
      "Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.",
      "The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center.",
      "But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said.",
      "When farmers decide what to plant, \u201cI think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAnd water is right below that.\u201d",
      "Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production.",
      "But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Maga\u00f1a, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.",
      "Pistachios require about 3 acre-feet (3,700 cubic meters) of water per acre (0.4 hectares) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said.",
      "\u201cYou see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage,\u201d Maga\u00f1a said. \u201cI haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out.\u201d"

      "Experts calculate that curbing and coping with global warming is going to cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don\u2019t have it",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- A complex international two-week-long game of climate change poker is convening. The stakes? Just the fate of an ever-warming world.",
      "Curbing and coping with climate change's worsening heat, floods, droughts and storms will cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don't have it, numerous reports and experts calculate. As United Nations climate negotiations started Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, the chief issue is who must ante up to help poor nations and especially how much.",
      "The numbers are enormous. The floor in negotiations is the $100 billion a year that poor nations \u2014 based on a categorization made in the 1990s \u2014 now get as part of a 2009 agreement that was barely met. Several experts and poorer nations say the need is $1 trillion a year or more.",
      "\u201cIt's a game with high stakes,\u201d said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, a physicist. \u201cRight now the fate of the planet depends very much on what we're able to pull off in the next five or 10 years.\u201d",
      "But this year's talks, known as COP29, won't be as high-profile as last year's, with 48 fewer heads of state scheduled to speak. The leaders of the top two carbon polluting countries \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 will be absent. But if money negotiations fail in Baku, it will handicap 2025\u2019s make-or-break climate negotiations, experts say.",
      "Not only is dealing with money always a touchy subject, but two of the rich countries that are expected to donate money to poor nations \u2014 the United States and Germany \u2014 are in the midst of dramatic government changes. Even though the United States delegation will be from Biden Administration, the reelection of Donald Trump, who downplays climate change and dislikes foreign aid, makes U.S. pledges unlikely to be fulfilled.",
      "The overarching issue is climate finance. Without it, experts say the world can't get a handle on fighting warming, nor can most of the nations achieve their current carbon pollution-cutting goals or the new ones they will submit next year.",
      "\u201cIf we don't solve the finance problem, then definitely we will not solve the climate problem,\u201d said former Colombian deputy climate minister Pablo Vieira, who heads the support unit at NDC Partnership, which helps nations with emissions-cutting goals.",
      "Nations can't cut carbon pollution if they can't afford to eliminate coal, oil and gas, Vieira and several other experts said. Poor nations are frustrated that they are being told to do more to fight climate change when they cannot afford it, he said. And the 47 poorest nations only created 4% of the heat-trapping gases in the air, according to the U.N.",
      "About 77% of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere now comes from the G20 rich nations, many of whom are now cutting back on their pollution, something that is not happening in most poor nations or China.",
      "\u201cThe countries that are rich today have become rich by polluting the Earth,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president of World Resources Institute.",
      "The money being discussed is for three things: Helping poor nations switch from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy; helping them adapt to the impacts of a warming world such as sea level rise and worsening storms; and compensating vulnerable poor nations for climate change damage.",
      "\u201cShould the global community fail to reach a (finance) goal, this is really just signing the death warrant of many developing countries,\" said Chukwumerije Okereke, director of the Center for Climate Change and Development in Nigeria.",
      "Michael Wilkins, a business professor who heads Imperial College's Centre for Climate Finance and Investment in the U.K., said since 2022 total climate finance has been nearly $1.5 trillion. But only 3% of that is actually geared toward the least developed countries, he said.",
      "\u201cThe Global South has been repeatedly let down by unmet pledges and commitments,\u201d said Sunita Narain, director general of New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.",
      "\u201cFinance is really the key component that compels all types of climate action,\u201d said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas, adaptation director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWithout that finance, there's simply not much that developing countries in particular can do.\u201d",
      "It's an issue of both self-interest and justice, Thomas and others said. It's not charity to help poor nations decarbonize because rich nations benefit when all countries cut emissions. After all, a warming world hurts everyone.",
      "Compensating for climate damage and helping nations prepare for future harm is a matter of justice, Thomas said. Even though they didn't create the problem, poor nations \u2014 especially small island nations \u2014 are particularly vulnerable to climate change's rising seas and extreme weather. Thomas mentioned how 2019's Hurricane Dorian smacked her grandparents home and \u201cthe only thing left standing was one toilet.\u201d",
      "The trillion-dollar figure on the table is about half of what the world spends annually on the military. Others say global fossil fuel subsidies could be redirected to climate finance; estimates of those subsidies range from the International Energy Agency\u2019s $616 billion a year to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s $7 trillion a year.",
      "\u201cWhen we need more for other things, including conflict, we seem to find it,\u201d United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said. \u201cWell, this is probably the largest conflict of all.\u201d",
      "A U.N. climate finance committee report looked at the need from 98 countries and estimated it as ranging from $455 billion to $584 billion per year.",
      "The money isn't just direct government aid from one nation to another. Some of it comes from multinational development finance banks, like the World Bank. There's also private investment that will be considered a large chunk. Developing nations are seeking relief from their $29 trillion global debt.",
      "Andersen said at least a sixfold increase in investment would be required to get on the path to limit future warming to just another two-tenths of a degree Celsius (0.4 degrees Fahrenheit) from now, which is the overarching goal the world adopted in 2015.",
      "Andersen's agency calculated that with nations' current emissions-curbing targets, the difference between well-financed and current efforts translates to half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) less future warming. Experts say stepped-up efforts that could reduce future warming even more also costs more.",
      "Who will pay is another sticking point. Climate talks for decades have used 1992 standards to categorize two groups of nations, essentially rich and poor, deciding that rich nations like the U.S. are the ones to financially help poor ones.

      "HONG KONG -- European markets powered higher Monday, catching up with last week's Wall Street rally. Bitcoin soared over $82,000 for the first time but Asian stocks fell as China\u2019s stimulus package disappointed investor expectations.",
      "Germany\u2019s DAX gained 1.2% to 19,438.89. In Paris, the CAC 40 added 1.1% to 7,421.24. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 also rose 0.7%, to 8,128.58.",

      "In Asia, China approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan during a meeting of its national legislature Friday. The long-anticipated stimulus is designed to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the growth rocket many had hoped for. While it\u2019s a substantial number, the stimulus is less about jump-starting economic growth and more about plugging holes in a struggling local government system,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.",
      "Meanwhile, China\u2019s inflation rate in October rose 0.3% year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday, marking a slowdown from September\u2019s 0.4% increase and dropping to its lowest level in four months.",

      "Treasury yields climbed in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",

    "story": [
      "Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House.",
      "But it might not be that easy.",
      "Many of the largest offshore wind companies put a brave face on the election results, pledging to work with Trump and Congress to build power projects and ignoring the incoming president's oft-stated hostility to them.",
      "In campaign appearances, Trump railed against offshore wind and promised to sign an executive order to block such projects.",
      "\u201cWe are going to make sure that that ends on Day 1,\u201d Trump said in a May speech. \u201cI\u2019m going to write it out in an executive order. It\u2019s going to end on Day 1.\"",
      "\u201cThey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.\u201d",
      "Numerous federal and state scientific agencies say there is no evidence linking offshore wind preparation to a spate of whale deaths along the U.S. East Coast in recent years. Turbines have been known to kill shorebirds, but the industry and regulators say there are policies to mitigate harm to the environment.",
      "Trump has railed against offshore wind turbines spoiling the view from a golf course he owns in Scotland. But numerous environmental groups say the real reason he opposes offshore wind is his support for the fossil fuel industry.",
      "There is almost 65 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity under development in the U.S., enough to power more than 26 million homes, and some turbines are already spinning in several states, according to the American Clean Power Association.",
      "Currently operating projects include the Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project and the South Fork Wind Farm about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point on New York\u2019s Long Island.",
      "Trump is unlikely to end those projects but might have more leverage over ones still in the planning stage, those in the debate say.",
      "Bob Stern, who headed an office in the U.S. Energy Department responsible for environmental protection during the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations, said Trump can get Congress to reduce or eliminate tax credits for offshore wind that were granted in the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Those credits are an integral part of the finances of many offshore wind projects.",
      "Stern, who leads the New Jersey anti-offshore wind group Save LBI, said Trump also could issue executive orders prohibiting further offshore leases and rescinding approval for ones already approved while pushing Congress to amend federal laws granting more protection for marine mammals.",
      "The president-elect also can appoint leaders of agencies involved in offshore wind regulation who would be hostile to it or less supportive.",
      "Opponents of offshore wind, many of them Republicans, were giddy following the election, saying they fully expect Trump to put an end to the industry.",
      "\u201cI believe this is a tipping point for the offshore wind industry in America,\u201d said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, one of the most vocal groups opposing offshore wind on the East Coast. \"They have been given a glidepath by Democrat-run administrations at the federal and state level for many years. For this industry, (Tuesday's) results will bring headwinds far greater than they have faced previously.\"",
      "But Tina Zappile, director of the Hughes Center for Public Policy at New Jersey's Stockton University, noted that in 2018, Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke voiced strong support for offshore wind. And even though the president-elect has bashed the technology, she predicted he won't just make it go away.",
      "\u201cOffshore wind might appear to be on the chopping block \u2014 Trump\u2019s explicitly said this was something he\u2019d fix on the first day \u2014 but when the economics of offshore wind are in alignment with his overall strategies of returning manufacturing to America and becoming energy-independent, his administration is likely to back away slowly from this claim,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cOffshore wind may be temporarily hampered, but its long-term prospects in the U.S. are unlikely to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Commercial fishermen in Maine said they hope the Trump administration will undo policies designed to help build and approve offshore wind projects, saying regulators attempted to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the industry against political change. Jerry Leeman, CEO of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association, called on Trump to reverse a commitment to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.",
      "The offshore wind industry is taking an optimistic stance, pledging to work with Trump his political allies. National and New Jersey wind industry groups, and several offshore wind developers including Atlantic Shores and Denmark-based Orsted, issued similarly worded statements highlighting terms likely to appeal to Republicans including job creation, economic development and national security.",
      "\u201cBy combining the strengths of all domestic energy resources, the Trump administration can advance an economy that is dynamic, secure, and clean,\u201d Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. \"We are committed to working with the Trump-Vance administration and the new Congress to continue this great American success story.\u201d",
      "But few Republicans were in a welcoming mood following the election. New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra listed the major offshore wind companies in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to pack your bags and get the hell away from the Jersey Shore, our marine life, fishing industry and beautiful beaches.\u201d",
      "Kanitra said he was looking forward \u201cto your stock prices tanking.\u201d And that was starting to happen.",
      "The stock prices of European offshore wind companies, many of which are planning or building projects on the U.S. East Coast, plunged amid fears the new administration would seek to slow or end such projects. Orsted closed down nearly 14% on Wednesday and was down 11% over the past five days. Turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems was down nearly 24% over that same period.",
      "Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, hosted Trump at a rally earlier this year at which Trump again vowed to kill offshore wind.",
      "\u201cWe are currently working out the specifics of what that will look like once he takes office again this January,\" VanDrew said. \u201cPresident Trump is a good friend of New Jersey, and he understands the devastating impact these projects will have on our communities.\u201d",

      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",
      "It was reported that degradation and resulting leaks involved piping installed in the Southwest, particularly in the Mohave Desert region in Arizona, California and Nevada.",
      "In Arizona, state investigators concluded that Southwest Gas failed to properly map where this type of piping had been installed.",
      "Southwest Gas estimates there are more than 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of the piping throughout Arizona. The utility says it has a plan to target high-risk areas for replacement or abandonment.",
      "The agreement between state regulators and Southwest Gas stems from two separate incidents in 2021, including one in Chandler in which an explosion injured four people.",
      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",
      "An amendment to the agreement that was proposed by Corporation Commissioner Kevin Thompson made clear that the company would have to propose new rates \u2014 and win regulatory approval through an administrative process \u2014 if it wants to recoup from customers any of the costs associated with fulfilling the agreement.",
      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "The announcement by Robert Habeck, who is also vice chancellor, follows the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition on Wednesday.",
      "The Greens are a small party that lost popularity in recent elections and whose support currently hovers around 10%. Germany\u2019s opposition center-right is leading in the polls.",

    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",

      "The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey say that recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between the neighboring countries and regional rivals are bearing fruit, although significant differences remain, notably over maritime boundaries...",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously.",
      "Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.",
      "\u201cI am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,\u201d Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed difficult moments during the past year,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cBut in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.\u201d",
      "With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential.",
      "\"We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,\" Fidan said. \"Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.\u201d",
      "Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters.",
      "Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war.",
      "Turkey also doesn\u2019t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law.",
      "Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks \u201cincluded the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cIt is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.\u201d",
      "Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled.",
      "\u201cThere are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,\" Fidan said. \"We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he added.",
      "Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc.",
      "While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks.",
      "The two \u201cemphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,\u201d Fidan said.",

The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",
      "Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",

Officials announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion), three-year plan to help local governments refinance their many trillions of debt that has ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic and a collapse of the property market.",
      "Financial markets worldwide have swung sharply as investors lay bets on what Trump\u2019s plans for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation  could mean for the global economy. But many professional investors have also urged caution, saying snaps back in prices could occur as it becomes more clear what proposals will become policy versus just starting points for negotiations.",

      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",

      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "About 221,000 people filed for jobless benefits in the most recent report, consistent with recent levels, which remain historically low. Unemployment claims are considered to be reflective of the number of layoffs in a given week. While there have been some recent softening in the labor market, it has broadly held up well under the stress of high interest rates."

    "summary": "Taron Johnson returned Joe Flacco&rsquo;s first pass 23 yards for a touchdown, and Josh Allen and James Cook each scored on TD runs to lead the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills past the Indianapolis Colts 30-20",
    "story": [
      "Taron Johnson returned Joe Flacco\u2019s first pass 23 yards for a touchdown, and Josh Allen and James Cook each scored on TD runs to lead the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills past the Indianapolis Colts 30-20",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Josh Allen expects more out of Buffalo\u2019s offense than he saw Sunday at Indianapolis.",
      "He couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more from the Bills' defense.",
      "Taron Johnson picked off Joe Flacco\u2019s first pass and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown, and Allen and James Cook each ran for scores as the Bills beat the Colts 30-20 for their fifth consecutive win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a faster start. We didn\u2019t play our best today, but we\u2019ll take the win,\u201d Allen said. \u201dFour forced turnovers \u2014 we\u2019ve got to hold onto the ball a little bit better. We\u2019ll take them how we can get them, and we\u2019ll turn the page tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The AFC East-leading Bills have topped 30 points in four straight games and improved to 8-2 for the first time since 1993. They earned their first win at Indianapolis since 1998 with Allen's receiving corps depleted by injuries.",
      "The defense delivered for the Bills this time, logging four sacks, picking off Flacco three times and recovering a fumble by Flacco to put Allen in position to cash in.",
      "\u201cI thought the defense, the takeaways was a big-time difference in the game,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just a very competitive group, they take a lot of pride in not letting each other down.\u201d",
      "Allen finished 23 of 37 for 280 yards with two interceptions while running eight times for 50 yards and his 57th career rushing TD to tie the late O.J. Simpson for No. 2 in Bills history. Cook had 19 carries 19 for 80 yards. Mack Hollins caught six passes for 86 yards.",
      "Meanwhile, Buffalo's defense forced the 39-year-old Flacco into multiple mistakes and negated Jonathan Taylor in the second half after he rushed for more than 100 yards before halftime. Taylor wound up with 21 carries for 114 yards while rookie receiver Adonai Mitchell had his best game of the season \u2014 six receptions, 71 yards.",
      "It wasn't enough to prevent the Colts (4-6) from losing their third straight or preventing Flacco from getting booed as he went 26 of 35 for 272 yards, two touchdowns and the three picks. He has six turnovers in his two starts since replacing the benched Anthony Richardson. Flacco is 1-3 as Indy's starter this season, failing to recapture the form he had last year when he led the Browns to the playoffs.",
      "\u201cThe first one was just an awful decision,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cThe toughest thing about not playing well is just your mentality and having to deal with the fact that you're not playing well and the best way to do that is to go back to work.\u201d",
      "Just seven plays after Johnson's pick-6, Flacco was intercepted again near midfield and the Bills quickly converted that takeaway into a field goal and a 10-0 lead.",
      "The Colts responded with Taylor's 59-yard run, which set up the first of two field goals by Matt Gay. After Indy's defense stopped the Bills on fourth down, Flacco capitalized with a 2-yard TD pass to Tyler Goodson.",
      "Allen's interception on the Bills' ensuing series set up the field goal that gave Indy a 13-10 lead, but Allen quickly regained control with his 13-yard TD run. Tyler Bass made field goals for Buffalo at the end of the first half and early in the fourth quarter, and Cook sealed the win with a 2-yard TD run early in the fourth.",
      "\u201cI threw two interceptions, can\u2019t do that. We can be cleaner, that\u2019s on me. We\u2019ve got to play better on offense,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe defense played awesome. We gritted it out and that was a team win right there.\u201d",
      "When the Bills needed a fourth-down conversion in the fourth quarter, Allen took matters into his own hands with a 5-yard run. But as Allen plowed forward for the first down, Colts defensive lineman Dayo Odeyingbo threw three punches in the scrum.",
      "No penalty was called, but Odeyingbo could hear from the league office this week.",
      "The Bills opened the game without two injured receivers, rookie Keon Coleman and the recently acquired Amari Cooper. They also lost TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) during the game. RT Spencer Brown left briefly with an ankle injury.",
      "Indy also deactivated its top receiver, Michael Pittman Jr. (back), and wound up playing three rookie offensive linemen after LT Bernhard Raimann left in the first half with a knee injury.",

He moved his team into position for the winning field goal with two completions to Jauan Jennings and two more to Pearsall.",
      "Pearsall sat out the first six games after being shot in the chest after an autograph session in downtown San Francisco on Aug. 31. On his touchdown, he caught a pass over the middle from Purdy, accelerated toward the left sideline where he outran the pursuit until safety Antoine Winfield Jr. closed in and nearly brought him down as the receiver extended the ball over the goal line.",
      "The Bucs wiped out a 10-0 deficit with help from 49ers punt returner Jacob Cowing, whose third-quarter muff was recovered at San Francisco's 21 to set up Tampa Bay's first TD. Four plays later, Mayfield threw a 9-yard scoring pass to Rachaad White that made it 10-10.",

That also matches the best start to a season in franchise history, and their 15-game win streak dating to last season is the longest in the NFL since the Packers won 19 in a row from 2010-11.",
      "Travis Kelce had eight catches for 64 yards and a touchdown for Kansas City. DeAndre Hopkins caught four passes for 56 yards, and Kareem Hunt was held to 35 yards rushing but also caught seven passes for 65 yards.",
      "\u201cAny way you win is good in this league,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cYou live for these moments. When you grow up playing football, you live for the walk-off whatever-it-is. And I'm glad we get to experience it together.\u201d",
      "Nix finished with 215 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Broncos (5-5). Courtland Sutton had six catches for 60 yards and a score. And their 13-yard hookup on third-and-6 with 1:45 left is what gave Denver a chance to kick as time expired.",
      "\u201cThey just made one extra play. When we thought it was in our hands, it wasn't,\u201d Nix said. \u201cIt's tough. And again, it's two good football teams out there playing against each other, and one day it will go our way.\u201d",
      "The Broncos stunned the Chiefs a year ago, forcing five turnovers in a 21-9 win at Denver that ended a 16-game losing streak in the series. And they clearly had the same intention in mind as the AFC West rivals met again Sunday.",
      "Their defense harassed Mahomes throughout the first half, particularly when an injury to Wanya Morris forced rookie left tackle Kingsley Suamataia into the game. And the Broncos capitalized on offense with two long scoring drives, the first ending with Nix finding Devaughn Vele wide open and the second with Sutton's 32-yard TD catch for a 14-3 lead.",
      "It was Mahomes who got the Chiefs on track, going 7 for 7 for 62 yards on the ensuing drive. When it looked as if it had stalled at the Denver 2, Reid went against his conservative nature on fourth down, and Mahomes hit Kelce for the score.",
      "The Chiefs still trailed 14-10 at the break, meaning they had Denver right where they wanted them.",
      "Unflappable in winning its last eight games when trailing in the second half, Kansas City closed within 14-13 on Butker's chip-shot field goal late in the third quarter. The Chiefs defense then forced back-to-back punts, and Mahomes and the offense drove to the Denver 2, where Butker added the go-ahead kick with just under six minutes remaining.",
      "Plenty of time for the Broncos to drive down the field. Not enough time for them to win.",
      "\u201cI told our team I was proud of the way they fought. I thought we outplayed them,\" Payton said. \u201cBut nonetheless, you have to beat a champion and we weren't able to do it, so obviously gut-wrenching.\u201d",
      "Taylor Swift was back at Arrowhead Stadium to watch Kelce and the Chiefs just six days after turning up to see their win over Tampa Bay on Monday night. The pop superstar resumes her Eras Tour on Thursday night at Rogers Centre in Toronto.",
      "Chiefs: Morris hurt his knee in the first half but returned early in the fourth quarter.",
      "Denver plays Atlanta next Sunday.",
      "Kansas City visits Buffalo the same day.",

    "summary": "Russell Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter to lift the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Ja...",

      "Russell Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter to lift the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Ja...",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Anyone who questioned Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's switch to Russell Wilson from Justin Fields might be reconsidering the wisdom of the move right about now. Wilson is looking like the guy who was a star earlier in his career \u2014 especially with those 50-50 deep balls he keeps connecting on.",
      "Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter for the quarterback's third scoring throw Sunday, lifting the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times on highlights,\u201d Tomlin said of Wilson's ability to complete the big play, something that helped the QB win one Super Bowl and reach another with the Seattle Seahawks. \u201cIt\u2019s a little better in person. Believe me.\u201d",
      "Coming off a bye, the AFC North-leading Steelers (7-2) won their fourth game in a row, including all three since Wilson took over from Fields. Wilson's stats were not the prettiest on Sunday, but he got the job done: 14 for 28 for 195 yards, the three TDs and the one pick.",
      "\u201cIt was a big-time catch by Mike. I just tried to give him a chance, let him do his thing,\u201d Wilson said about Williams, acquired last week from the New York Jets. \u201cYou visualize those moments and what could happen and just trusting guys. That was all Big Mike there.\u201d",
      "George Pickens delivered an acrobatic catch in the end zone on a 16-yarder in the first quarter, and tight end Pat Freiermuth scored on a pass from 3 yards out in the second, much to the delight of the thousands of Terrible Towel-twirling Steelers fans in the stands.",
      "Washington (7-3) led 24-14 but couldn't hold on as it attempted to get to 8-2 overall for the first time since 1986 and 5-0 at home for the first time since 1991, when the team went on to win the Super Bowl under coach Joe Gibbs.",
      "\u201cToo many small mistakes,\u201d defensive end Clelin Ferrell said.",
      "Daniels, the No. 2 overall draft pick who has starred for first-year coach Dan Quinn, was 17 for 34 for 202 yards without a touchdown or interception. He also had three carries for 5 yards, his lowest output as a pro, while still dealing with a rib injury that he described as \u201cstill there, but it's nothing that's holding me back.\u201d",
      "As for watching his counterpart Wilson, Daniels observed: \u201cHe made plays when the plays needed to be made.\u201d",
      "Never more so than on the over-the-shoulder toss to Williams \u2014 his only catch of the game \u2014 to turn a six-point deficit into a one-point lead for the visitors.",
      "Pickens' take on what Wilson showed there?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of his biggest components of his game: trusting his receivers,\u201d Pickens said.",
      "After that play, Daniels moved Washington to midfield. On fourth-and-9 with less than 1 1/2 minutes to go, Daniels connected with Zach Ertz, but the catch was ruled just short of a first down; until then, the Commanders were 11 for 11 on fourth down this season.",
      "On the ensuing possession, Pittsburgh faced a fourth-and-1 at Washington's 49 with 1:02 on the clock and decided to line up as if to go for it. But Wilson's hard count got rookie defensive lineman Johnny Newton to jump too soon, and the penalty allowed the Steelers to keep the ball and run out the clock.",
      "This was far from a perfect performance by Pittsburgh, though.",
      "Commanders safety Jeremy Chinn picked off Wilson late in the third quarter and recovered Jaylen Warren's fumble at the 1-yard line in the fourth.",
      "The worst turnover by the Steelers had to be the fake punt deep in its own territory in the first quarter. The snap went to up-back Miles Killebrew, who threw to a wide-open James Pierre, but he dropped the ball. That gave Washington possession at Pittsburgh's 15, and three plays later, Austin Ekeler scored the first of his two short touchdowns runs.",
      "\u201cThat is me. I own that. I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t execute it, so it was a bad idea.\u201d",
      "Steelers: LB Alex Highsmith (ankle) and CB Donte Jackson (hamstring) got hurt in the second half.",
      "Commanders: C Tyler Biadasz (ankle) left the game briefly but returned. ... RT Andrew Wylie (shoulder) was a late scratch, while newly acquired CB Marshon Lattimore (hamstring), RB Brian Robinson Jr. (hamstring) and K Austin Seibert (hip) sat out, as expected. ... Seibert's replacement, Zane Gonzalez, made two field goals.",
      "Steelers: Host division rival Baltimore next Sunday.",

      "Joey Logano won his third NACAR championship Sunday with a relentless drive at Phoenix Raceway that gave Team Penske its third major motorsports title in less than a month",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- Eliminated from the playoffs at the end of the second round, Joey Logano received a second chance when another competitor was disqualified.",
      "He pounced on the opportunity.",
      "Logano was added to the round of eight following Alex Bowman's disqualification and immediately went to Las Vegas Motor Speedway to win the third-round opener. It made Logano the first driver locked into Sunday's winner-take-all finale at Phoenix Raceway with three weeks to prepare his Ford for the title run.",
      "He capitalized with his his third NACAR Cup Series championship, using a near-flawless drive to hold off teammate Ryan Blaney and give Team Penske its third major motorsports title in less than a month and third consecutive NASCAR title.",
      "Logano actually called his shot after qualifying second Saturday when he confidently acknowledged it was his Cup Series title to lose.",
      "\u201cYeah, I do. I feel like our car is strong. We got them down now,\u201d Logano boasted. \u201cWe just have to put our foot on their throats. We feel pretty strong about our team, and these type of pressure situations we feel really solid about as far as our team in these moments.\u201d",
      "It may not have been how boss Roger Penske would have phrased it, but it showed the team owner how relentless his team leader can be.",
      "\u201cI might have used different words, but that\u2019s OK,\" Penske said, \u201cwhen you win, you can say whatever you want, I guess.\u201d",
      "Logano held off Blaney over the final 20 laps to beat him for the Cup series title by 0.330 seconds. Blaney was trying to become the first back-to-back champion since Jimmie Johnson won five straight from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Instead, Logano became the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more championships. Kyle Busch is the only other active driver with multiple titles.",
      "\u201cI love the playoffs, I love it man,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWhat a team, what a Penske battle there at the end. Three of them? That's truly special.\"",
      "It was the first time in Team Penske history the organization finished 1-2 in the championship. And, it came after Penske's sports car team in IMSA won the title last month and his World Endurance Championship team won the title last weekend in Bahrain.",
      "Roger Penske said he worried in the closing laps his two drivers would crash into each other, ending the title hopes for both. He also praised longtime sponsor Shell-Pennzoil, which was on Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden\u2019s car for his victory in May for Penske.",
      "Penske also deferred taking too much of the credit for the team success.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the people,\u201d Penske said. \u201cMy name might be on the door, but it\u2019s all about the people who make the difference and we sure have them on this team.\u201d",
      "Blaney was exhausted after the race, and despite his disappointment was thrilled for the Penske organization.",
      "\u201cAt least a Penske car won it,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cThey put together a great playoffs, and we\u2019re happy. If we\u2019re going to race somebody, I\u2019m happy it was him for the championship, and happy to be 1-2 for Roger, three in a row for Roger, super amazing, and Ford.\u201d",
      "Penske and Ford have won three consecutive Cup Series championships. Logano won in 2022 and Blaney won last year.",
      "\u201cOne-two for Team Penske, three championships in a row, can't be more proud of this team,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the best driver but I\u2019ve got the best team. And together, we\u2019re very well-rounded and can show up when it matters the most.\u201d",
      "The finale was winner-take-all to the highest finisher between Logano, Blaney, William Byron in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports and Tyler Reddick of the 23XI Racing team owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin.",
      "Byron finished third in the race and Reddick was sixth. It was Byron's second consecutive appearance in the finale, first for Reddick.",
      "\u201cMakes you hungrier, but also just more experience in what it takes,\u201d said Byron, the Daytona 500 winner. \u201cI feel like this style of track has been tough on us, and we made a lot of strides this year, but still more to go. If we can just kind of inch up on this style of track, I know we\u2019re so good at all the other ones, and we can put it all together.\u201d",
      "Reddick, who had been subdued all week compared to his fellow title contenders, didn't lead a lap and had Jordan pacing behind the pit wall much of the race.",
      "\u201cMichael was just proud of the effort of our team all year long,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cPut up a good fight. We didn't make any mistakes that took ourselves out of it. We fought as hard as we could.\u201d",
      "The four title contenders finished in the top six, with Reddick behind Kyle Larson of Hendrick and Christopher Bell, who led a race-high 143 laps after he was disqualified from the finale last week at Martinsville for a safety violation. Byron took his spot instead, and Bell insisted he had been cheated out of the chance to race for the title.",
      "Logano, a 34-year-old from Connecticut, led 107 laps in the dominating win that Blaney made closer than expected in the final laps.",
      "But, his very presence in the final four was controversial as Logano was eliminated from the playoffs after the second round. He was reinstated before Las Vegas, where he won to give the No. 22 team three weeks to prepare for Phoenix.",
      "\u201cOur team is better under pressure,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThe race started in Vegas for us. The amount of work and effort that went into building this race car right here, the amount of time, I don\u2019t think anyone works harder than us. We were up at 6 in the morning this morning going over stuff. The guys just want it bad and I\u2019m glad we delivered.\"",

      "There were no wins.",
      "For only the second time, the other being Oct. 10, 2020, the state saw its seven FBS programs \u2014 Miami, Florida, Florida State, UCF, South Florida, Florida Atlantic and Florida International \u2014 combine to go 0-5 on the same day.",
      "It all happened Saturday: Miami watched its unbeaten start end with a 28-23 loss to Georgia Tech, Florida State lost 52-3 to Notre Dame, Florida lost to Texas 49-17, South Florida lost 28-7 to Navy and UCF lost 35-31 to Arizona State.",

    "story": [
      "Dallas receiver CeeDee Lamb is throwing shade at his home field after losing a ball in the sun on a potential touchdown catch",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- CeeDee Lamb was unhappy about losing a ball in the sun on an incompletion that helped keep Dallas from scoring a go-ahead touchdown in the first half of a 34-6 loss to Philadelphia on Sunday.",
      "Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones was perturbed that the sun was brought up as an issue once again in his $1.2 billion retractable roof stadium, which has glass doors on either end.",
      "AT&T Stadium has an unusual east-west alignment from end zone to end zone, as opposed to most venues being north-south. On clear days, the sun shines in the windows on the west side during the first half of games that kick off in the afternoon.",
      "Lamb, Dallas' All-Pro receiver, was looking into to sun in the second quarter while open on a crossing route in the end zone when a throw from Cooper Rush went behind him and he never adjusted to the ball.",
      "Lamb then pointed to his eyes, and was making similar gestures on the sideline during another frustrating home loss for the Cowboys (3-6), who are on a four-game losing streak overall and 0-4 at AT&T Stadium.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see the ball. Couldn\u2019t see the ball, at all. The sun,\u201d said Lamb, who ended a preseason-long holdout by signing a $136 million, four-year contract extension in late August.",
      "Asked whether the Cowboys should put up curtains on that, Lamb said, \u201cYes. One thousand percent.\u201d",
      "And on the question of making the suggestion to Jones, Lamb said, \u201cI mean, y\u2019all are doing my job for me right now.\u201d",
      "It has been suggested plenty of times, and Jones has always flatly rejected it. The 82-year-old billionaire angrily rejected it after bringing up the issue unprompted in his post-game session with reporters.",
      "\u201cBy the way, we know where the sun is going to be when we flip the coin, so we do know where the damn sun is going to be in our own stadium,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLet\u2019s just tear the damn stadium down and build another one. Are you kidding me?\u201d",
      "While Jones' response could be taken as a criticism of embattled coach Mike McCarthy, Jones said it wasn't.",
      "\u201cEvery team that comes in here has the same issues,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey know where the sun is going to be. Every team has the same thing. I'm not saying (it\u2019s on McCarthy).

      "MILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo offered a handshake to Jaylen Brown after committing an offensive foul against the Boston Celtics wing \u2014 only to pull his hand back at the last moment.",
      "The incident in the first half of the Celtics\u2019 113-107 victory over the Bucks on Sunday caused Brown to refer to Antetokounmpo as a \u201cchild.\u201d Antetokounmpo responded that he was only joking around.",
      "This sequence began after Antetokounmpo\u2019s elbow appeared to inadvertently hit Brown\u2019s face in the second quarter, resulting in an offensive foul against the two-time MVP.",
      "As they headed back up the floor, Antetokounmpo held out his hand toward Brown, only to pull it back over the top of his face while smiling at him. Antetokounmpo then reached out his hand again, but the Celtics\u2019 three-time All-Star looked down without reciprocating.",
      "The scene got plenty of attention on social media.",
      "\u201cGiannis is a child,\u201d said Brown, who scored 14 points in his return after missing four games with a hip injury. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that\u2019s what we did tonight.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo said he didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d said Antetokounmpo, who had 43 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. \u201cWe\u2019re playing basketball. At the same time, we\u2019ve got to have fun when we play. I think he\u2019s an incredible player. He does whatever he can to help his team win, an extremely competitive player. We\u2019ve played against one another many times. I think we\u2019re always trying to joke around within the flow of the game. It\u2019s something I do with my kids when we play around. Sometimes, I\u2019m like, \u2018Give me a high-five. Oh, you\u2019re too slow.\u2019 I just did it. I enjoyed it, though. It was fun.\u201d",
      "When Antetokounmpo was told about Brown\u2019s postgame comment, the 6-foot-11 forward went into more detail with his response.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI play the game with fun, joy. I try to surround myself around young people so I can stay young myself, try to be around my kids a lot, my nieces, and sometimes I might go out there at times on the court when I play and do stuff like that, but at the end of the day, as I said, I think he\u2019s an incredible player. He always does the right thing to help his team win. But I\u2019m just going to continue to be me.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, if I\u2019m called a child, so be it. I have three children of my own and I think six nieces. I take care of a lot of kids around here. Sometimes when you\u2019re around a kid, you try to act like a kid. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun to be around them. So I just try to go out there and have fun. Again, great player, great competitor. If I have another opportunity, I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo and Brown had another episode in the fourth quarter. After Antetokounmpo drove to the basket with the game tied at 95-all, Brown received a flagrant foul for making significant impact to an airborne player in an unnecessary manner.",
      "Antetokounmpo made the two ensuing free throws to put Milwaukee ahead with 6:52 remaining, but the Bucks didn\u2019t score on their ensuing possession and Boston took the lead for good a minute later.",
      "Brown was asked if that second-quarter incident was on his mind when that flagrant foul occurred.",
      "\u201cNaw,\u201d Brown replied. \u201cI was playing basketball.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, a group of U.S. researchers has concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",

      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t in slavery. My mother wasn't in slavery. But we\u2019re a couple of generations away. So, when you think about how brutal and awful slavery was for our people, it\u2019s awful and concerning,\u201d Dunham said.",
      "About six middle school students in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, received the messages too, said Megan Shafer, acting superintendent of the Lower Merion School District.",
      "\u201cThe racist nature of these text messages is extremely disturbing, made even more so by the fact that children have been targeted,\u201d she wrote in a letter to parents.",
      "Students at some major universities, including Clemson in South Carolina and the University of Alabama, said they received the messages. The Clemson Police Department said in a statement that it had been notified of the \u201cdeplorable racially motivated text and email messages\u201d and encouraged anyone who received one to report it.",
      "Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement calling the messages that targeted some of its students \u201cdeeply unsettling.\u201d It urged calm and assured students that the texts likely were from bots or malicious actors with \u201cno real intentions or credibility.\u201d",
      "Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel said Black students who are members of the organization's Missouri State University chapter received texts citing Trump\u2019s win and calling them out by name as being \u201cselected to pick cotton\u201d next Tuesday. Chapel said police in the southeastern Missouri city of Springfield, home of the university, have been notified.",
      "\u201cIt points to a well-organized and resourced group that has decided to target Americans on our home soil based on the color of our skin,\u201d Chapel said in a statement.",
      "Nick Ludlum, a senior vice president for the wireless industry trade group CTIA, said: \u201cWireless providers are aware of these threatening spam messages and are aggressively working to block them and the numbers that they are coming from.\u201d",
      "David Brody, director of the Digital Justice Initiative at The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that they aren\u2019t sure who is behind the messages but estimated they had been sent to more than 10 states, including most Southern states, Maryland, Oklahoma and even the District of Columbia. The district's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement that its intelligence unit was investigating the origins of the message.",
      "Brody said a number of civil rights laws can be applied to hate-related incidents. The leaders of several other civil rights organizations condemned the messages, including Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who said, \u201cHate speech has no place in the South or our nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe threat \u2014 and the mention of slavery in 2024 \u2014 is not only deeply disturbing, but perpetuates a legacy of evil that dates back to before the Jim Crow era, and now seeks to prevent Black Americans from enjoying the same freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness,\u201d said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. \u201cThese actions are not normal. And we refuse to let them be normalized.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Three NASA astronauts whose prolonged space station mission ended with a trip to the hospital last month declined to say Friday which one of them was sick.",
      "Astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps publicly discussed their spaceflight for the first time since returning from the International Space Station on Oct. 25. They spent nearly eight months in orbit, longer than expected because of all the trouble with Boeing\u2019s Starliner crew capsule and rough weather, including Hurricane Milton.",

      "\u201cSpaceflight is still something we don\u2019t fully understand. We\u2019re finding things that we don\u2019t expect sometimes. This was one of those times and we\u2019re still piecing things together on this,\" said Barratt, the only member of the crew who had flown in space before.",
      "Epps said everyone is different in how they respond to space -- and gravity.",

    "summary": "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",

      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "During Trump\u2019s first term, more than 246 agency regulations, guidance documents and memoranda were challenged in federal courts. The administration won 54 of the cases, a 22% success rate, according to data from the Institute for Policy Integrity at the NYU School of Law.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 05:45:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump ally Kash Patel, a former Defense Department official who wants to end the \"Deep State,\" could make big changes if he's given a top spot at the FBI or DOJ.",
    "story": [
      "The former Defense Department official wants to end the \"Deep State.\"",
      "Last year, as Donald Trump's reelection bid was underway, he declared that a new book by his fiercely loyal adviser Kash Patel would serve as a \"blueprint\" for his next administration.",
      "\"This is the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign,\" Trump said of the book on his Truth Social media platform.",
      "Titled \"Government Gangsters,\" it calls for a \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the Justice Department and an eradication of \"government tyranny\" within the FBI by firing \"the top ranks\" and prosecuting \"to the fullest extent of the law\" anyone who \"in any way abused their authority for political ends.\"",
      "\"[T]he FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken,\" Patel claimed in his book. Democrats \"should be very afraid,\" Patel wrote, as Trump and his allies battle \"the Deep State\" -- what conspiracy theorists claim is a cadre of career employees inside government who are working together to secretly manipulate policy and undermine elected leaders.",
      "After Trump's historic reelection last week, media speculation has suggested that Patel, a former Defense Department official, could be under consideration to become Trump's attorney general or CIA director -- or that he could even replace current FBI Director Christopher Wray, who Trump has reportedly vowed to fire.",
      "\"President Trump called [my book] the roadmap for 2024, and now let's put it into work,\" Patel said Thursday on a podcast, without indicating whether he himself might take on a senior-level role in the incoming administration.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Patel's proximity to Trump and Trump's public embrace of Patel's book underscore how a major shake-up could be coming to the Justice Department or FBI.",
      "Here is what Patel has said about what new leadership could do.",
      "Patel, who once served as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security division, has long accused leaders in the FBI and Justice Department of exploiting their authority to boost Democrats and undermine Republicans -- especially Trump.",
      "There's been a \"two-tier system of justice,\" Patel has routinely said.",
      "He often highlights his subsequent work as a congressional investigator, when he helped lead the House Republicans' probe of \"Russiagate\" -- which, as he describes it, exposed FBI wrongdoing in its 2016 investigation of alleged ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.",
      "That work led to Patel joining the Trump administration in 2019, and in the final year of Trump's presidency, Patel was appointed acting deputy director of national intelligence -- the second-in-command of the entire U.S. intelligence community -- and then chief of staff to the acting U.S. defense secretary, a position critics claimed he was unqualified to hold.",
      "A special counsel investigation launched by the Justice Department under Trump's first term concluded that \"senior FBI personnel\" and federal prosecutors working the Russia-related probe had \"displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor\" toward politically-tainted information, failing to \"adequately examine or question\" that information before launching a full-scale investigation of Trump and his associates, which included intercepting the communications of one former Trump adviser.",
      "In its own report on the matter, the office of the Justice Department's inspector general said that while it found \"fundamental errors\" and significant \"failures\" in the FBI probe, it found no evidence that \"political bias or improper motivation influenced\" the investigation, including the decision to intercept those communications.",
      "Still, in his book, Patel said \"all those who manipulated evidence [or] hid exculpatory information\" should face charges.",
      "He also alleged \"abuses of prosecutorial discretion\" by the Justice Department in declining to charge Hillary Clinton for allegedly compromising classified information through her use of a private email server, and in declining to charge President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for what Patel describes as influence-peddling -- while indicting Trump ally Steve Bannon over his refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and also charging so many of the Trump supporters who were at the Capitol that day.",
      "\"Those specific prosecutors, and division[s] within the department, that selectively apply the law should be removed and brought to heel,\" Patel wrote in his book.",
      "In a campaign video released last year, Trump promised that if reelected, he will \"immediately reissue\" a 2020 executive order giving him the power \"to remove rogue bureaucrats.\"",
      "\"And I will wield that power very aggressively,\" he declared.",
      "Trump also said he will \"totally reform\" the court system that in 2016 and 2017 approved the FBI's applications to intercept his former adviser's communications.",
      "On another podcast two months ago, Patel said anyone involved in \"Russiagate\" should be stripped of their security clearances.",
      "According to Patel, there is a \"massive\" list of such government officials, from the FBI and Justice Department to the CIA and U.S. military.",
      "\"They all still have clearances,\" including those who left government for private sector jobs, so \"everybody\" should lose their clearances, Patel said.",
      "Patel said he has personally \"recommended\" to Trump that the new administration also strip any security clearances still held by the 51 then-former intelligence officials, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan, who in October 2020, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, signed onto a letter dismissing the public release of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop as part of a \"Russian information operation.\"",
      "\"We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails ... are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement,\" they wrote. \"[But if] we are right, this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.\"",
      "Trump and his allies have accused the 51 former intelligence officials of trying to influence the 2020 election themselves. And that's why Patel wants Trump to strip them of their clearances.",
      "\"Because it's justified,\" Patel said. \"It's not an act of vengeance. They have had the opportunity to recant, and all 51 of them have doubled-down, and tripled-down. So pull them. I think he will.\"",
      "Speaking on Thursday's podcast about FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. -- where more than 7,000 agents, analysts, administrative personnel and other employees work -- Patel said that the new Trump administration should \"close that building down.\"",
      "\"Open it up the next day as the museum to the Deep State,\" he added.",
      "Patel said the FBI should then leave about 50 people from its staff somewhere in Washington to help keep the agency running, and send the thousands of other employees into the field to join the 16,000 employees already there.",
      "Meanwhile, in his book, Patel said the Justice Department should \"drastically curb\" the number of cases that it prosecutes in Washington, because Washington is \"perhaps the most liberal jurisdiction in America.\"",
      "On Thursday's podcast, Patel described Trump's election victory as a \"mandate for the truth\" about \"the corruption\" inside government.",
      "Therefore, he said, the new Trump administration should \"get out all the remaining documents that were blocked\" by the Biden administration and by \"Deep State\" efforts in other administrations.",
      "Patel has long called for the public disclosure of documents still unreleased from the FBI's investigation of Trump and alleged ties to Russia.",
      "On Jan. 19, 2021, Trump's final full day in office, the outgoing president announced that he had declassified a binder with many of those documents. But for reasons that still remain unclear, none of the documents were ever officially released.",
      "Now, as president again, Trump \"can expose the documents that these folks have written for decades, allowing [their] corrupt activities,\" Patel said on Thursday.",
      "\"He's going to come in there and maybe give them the Epstein list, and maybe the P. Diddy list,\" Patel added, referring to documents involving the late sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein and hip hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who denies wrongdoing in the sexual abuse cases recently filed against him and maintains his innocence on the criminal charges he faces.",
      "In the campaign video released last year, Trump promised to establish a \"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\" that will \"declassify and publish all documents on Deep State spying, censorship, and corruption.\"",
      "It's all part of \"my plan to dismantle the Deep State and reclaim our democracy from Washington corruption once and for all,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of President Joe Biden",
      "WASHINGTON -- Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of Democratic President Joe Biden, who had hoped to defeat his Republican predecessor a second time and reside there for four more years.",
      "That may make for an awkward encounter, especially given that, after Biden ousted Trump in 2020, Trump offered no such White House invitation to Biden. Trump even left Washington before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, becoming the first president to do so since Andrew Johnson skipped the 1869 swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "Biden also has the unusual distinction of having beaten Trump in one cycle and run against him for about 15 months during this year\u2019s campaign. As he sought reelection, Biden constantly decried Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values before leaving the race in July and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who took on her own campaign and lost on Election Day.",
      "When the two meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it\u2019ll technically be the first time since 1992 that an outgoing president sits down with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign. Back then, Republican President George H.W. Bush met with Democrat and President-elect Bill Clinton about two weeks after they squared off on Election Day.",
      "Bush and Clinton talked policy before going together to the Roosevelt Room to meet with their transition staff. Clinton later called the meeting \u201cterrific\u201d and said Bush was \u201cvery helpful.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, such handoff meetings between outgoing presidents and their replacements have been by turns friendly, tense and somewhere in between.",
      "This time, Biden has vowed to ensure a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working with Trump, who is both his presidential predecessor and successor, to bring the country together. Biden\u2019s White House invitation to Trump includes his wife, the former and now incoming first lady, Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cI assured him that I\u2019d direct my entire administration to work with his team,\u201d Biden said of the call with Trump when he made the invitation. The president-elect \u201clooks forward to the meeting,\" spokesman Steven Cheung said.",
      "Jim Bendat, a historian and author of \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,\u201d called face-to-face chats between outgoing and incoming presidents \u201chealthy for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that the Democrats have chosen to take the high road and returned to the traditions that really do make America great,\u201d Bendat said.",
      "This year's meeting won't be uncharted territory for Trump.",
      "He and then-Democratic President Barack Obama held a longer-than-scheduled 90-minute Oval Office discussion days after the 2016 election. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also showed Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner around the West Wing.",
      "\u201cWe now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Obama told Trump, despite the president-elect being fresh off a victory that dented the outgoing president\u2019s legacy.",
      "Trump appeared nervous and was unusually subdued, calling Obama \u201ca good man\u201d and the meeting \u201ca great honor.\u201d He said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Obama and that they \u201cdiscussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties.\u201d",
      "\u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Trump said. Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the meeting as \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d and he noted that the two \u201cdid not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "In fact, that encounter went smoothly enough to reassure a few Trump critics that he might grow into the job and become more presidential in temperament and action \u2014 an assessment quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s unique relish of bombast and political conflict once his administration began, particularly when it came to his predecessor.",
      "Only about four months later, Trump accused Obama \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower before the 2016 election. On social media, he blasted the former president for engaging in \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and decrying it as \u201cNixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d",
      "Obama aides now say that while the 2016 Trump-Obama meeting went well publicly, the incoming president's team ignored most of the transition process and did not have the same reverence for the White House and federal institutions that they or Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s team had.",
      "One recalled that the only question Trump counterparts asked at the time was not about the coming workload or responsibilities, but how best to find an apartment in Washington.",
      "The official transition process does not mandate that presidents invite their successors to face-to-face meetings, though it can feel that way.",
      "\u201cThe psychological transfer occurs then,\" former Vice President Walter Mondale once said.",
      "There's no record of George Washington scheduling a formal meeting with the nation's second president, John Adams, before leaving the then-capital city of New York. And Adams, after moving into the White House during his term, never invited his political rival and successor, Thomas Jefferson, over before leaving without attending Jefferson's inauguration in 1801.",
      "Still, by 1841, President Martin Van Buren hosted President-elect William Henry Harrison \u2014 who had soundly beaten him on Election Day \u2014 for dinner at the White House. He even later offered to leave the official residence early to make room for his successor after Washington's National Hotel, where Harrison had been staying, became overcrowded. Harrison instead made a brief, preinaugural trip to Virginia.",
      "More recently, Republican George W. Bush welcomed Obama to the White House in 2008 after calling the election of the nation's first Black president a \u201ctriumph of the American story.\u201d",
      "And eight years prior, Bush himself was the newcomer when he met with the outgoing Clinton, who had denied his father a second term. Their chat came just eight days after the Supreme Court resolved the disputed 2000 election, and Bush also later headed to the vice presidential residence to briefly talk with the man he defeated, Al Gore.",
      "Bush and Gore didn't say what they discussed, though vice presidential press aide Jim Kennedy described the conversation as meant to \u2033demonstrate that this is a country where we put aside our differences after a long and difficult campaign.\u2033",
      "Trump and Harris spoke by phone this past week but don't have a face-to-face meeting planned.",

      "A six-justice conservative majority on the Supreme Court will potentially provide legal cover, and its decision in June to enshrine presumptive immunity for official presidential acts could well embolden Trump in ways he hadn\u2019t been before.",
      "But Trump\u2019s agenda and his personal impulses won\u2019t proceed entirely unchecked.",
      "Trump\u2019s appointments to lead executive agencies will require Senate confirmation and are not guaranteed. During his first term, several picks had to withdraw from consideration after stiff opposition from within his own party.",
      "Presidential executive orders and Trump agency regulations will have to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, an arcane 1946 law requiring a \u201cnotice and comment period\u201d for policy changes and proof that public input was considered.",
      "\u201cWe will use all the tools at our disposal -- including aggressive litigation -- to ensure that key consumer and other regulatory protections remain intact,\u201d said Robert Weissman and Lisa Gilbert, co-presidents of Public Citizen, a progressive advocacy group that has sued Trump in the past.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, more than 246 agency regulations, guidance documents and memoranda were challenged in federal courts. The administration won 54 of the cases, a 22% success rate, according to data from the Institute for Policy Integrity at the NYU School of Law.",
      "In 192 cases, a court either ruled against the Trump agency or the agency withdrew the controversial action after being sued. Many of those losses involved a violation of the APA.",
      "The Supreme Court notably struck down Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; blocked the White House effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census; and invalided the initial Trump travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think people paid enough attention to the fact that Trump heeded the Court and agreed to rewrite the \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 three times so that it would pass constitutional muster,\u201d said Sarah Isgur, a former Trump Justice Department official and an ABC News legal contributor.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups have vowed to aggressively bring fresh litigation against Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cWhen President Trump targets immigrants, dissidents, and his political opponents -- we will challenge him in the courts, at the state legislatures, and in the streets,\u201d Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said in a statement.",
      "The group filed 434 actions against the first Trump administration, winning many cases even before Trump-appointed judges.",
      "Democrat-led states are also preparing to join the legal fight.",
      "\u201cLet there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law,\u201d said Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, which filed more than 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration.",
      "(By way of comparison, Texas sued the Obama administration 48 times during his two full terms, according to the Texas Tribune.)",
      "Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker this week warned, \u201cTo anyone who intends to come take away the freedom and opportunity and dignity of Illinoisans, I would remind you that a happy warrior is still a warrior. You come for my people, you come through me.\u201d",
      "The expected onslaught of litigation will collide with a federal judicial system packed full of judges that Trump appointed -- more than 200 nominees in four years surpassing the total elevated by then-President Barack Obama in eight years.",
      "Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court bench -- justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- and may get a historic opportunity to nominate even more should a current justice retire or die. Such a development would consolidate conservative power on the Supreme Court for generations.",
      "\u201cWill the Supreme Court act as a meaningful check on a second Trump presidency? During the first Trump administration they were a real check,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania Law Professor Kate Shaw, an ABC News legal contributor. \u201cThat, however, was a different court. Trump has now transformed the Supreme Court, and this court is not one that is likely to act as a comparable check.\u201d",
      "As for checks on Trump\u2019s individual conduct, Chief Justice John Roberts made clear in his landmark opinion in June that no current or former president has absolute immunity from criminal or civil prosecution.",
      "While Roberts said core constitutional powers are fully protected, he said there is only \u201cpresumptive immunity\u201d for other \u201cofficial acts,\u201d but left to future potential cases to test the boundaries.",
      "Private conduct has no civil or criminal immunity at all, the court has said. In 2020, Trump was forced to comply with a grand jury subpoena for his financial records. Two years later, the court said Trump had to turn over his taxes to a House committee.",

    "summary": "President Joe Biden will see out his term knowing that President-elect Donald Trump -- a man he called a \"genuine danger to American security\" -- will succeed him.",
    "story": [
      "Some abroad hope Biden's final months bring bold action to help end conflicts.",
      "LONDON -- President Joe Biden will see out his term knowing that President-elect Donald Trump -- a man he fought desperately hard to unseat in 2020 and called a \"genuine danger to American security\" -- will succeed him.",
      "Foreign policy has been central in Biden's long political career. It will likewise form a major chunk of his legacy, as will the two wars -- Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Middle East conflagration sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack -- that erupted during his term.",
      "Now less encumbered by political calculations -- for himself or for Vice President Kamala Harris -- and with only two months until Trump's second inauguration, the outgoing president may have one last window to wield the power of the Oval Office in both theaters.",
      "But with Trump looming above the outgoing Biden-Harris administration, American allies and enemies may be hesitant to engage with the outgoing administration.",
      "European nations, for example, are already shifting focus to how best to court Trump, Leslie Vinjamuri of the British Chatham House think tank told ABC News.",
      "\"All these European leaders are very quickly reaching out,\" she added. \"They're congratulating him. They want to talk with him. They want to work with him, because they understand that the stakes are extremely high and they clearly feel that by talking with him, they have an ability to influence policy and the outcome.\"",
      "\"What they don't want to do is to be seen to be making a deal with Joe Biden that undercuts whatever it is that Trump is going to do,\" Vinjamuri added.",
      "\"It's a very tricky position to be in, because if anything's visible that cuts across what he wants to do, you as a leader risk being punished.\"",
      "Those at the top of American politics know that foreign policy success can accelerate careers and define legacies. Former President Richard Nixon infamously undermined President Lyndon B. Johnson's efforts to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War during the 1968 election campaign for fear it would reduce his chances of victory.",
      "Though he has already secured his second term, Trump appears unlikely to help the Biden administration with any foreign policy \"wins\" in its closing days.",
      "\"There's a lot of uncertainty and room for maneuver -- it's highly unpredictable,\" Vinjamuri said.",
      "Russia's war on Ukraine has dominated much of Biden's presidency. He will leave office with Moscow's forces holding large parts of Ukraine and still advancing, even if slowly and at huge cost.",
      "\"I think that now Biden can be much more decisive in support of Ukraine, especially when he sees that Trump will be the next president,\" Oleksandr Merezhko -- a member of Ukraine's parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee -- told ABC News.",
      "\"Biden has his hands completely untied,\" Merezhko added. \"Now Biden is thinking about his legacy.\"",
      "\"He might even try to take some decisions which will make irreversible changes in support of Ukraine -- for example, he might lift all the restrictions on the use of the Western weapons on the territory of Russia,\" Merezhko said. \"And he might start the process of inviting Ukraine to join NATO.\"",
      "Merezkho acknowledged that progress on the NATO front might be ambitious. \"Yes, he doesn't have much time,\" he said. \"But he -- with [National Security Adviser] Jake Sullivan and [Secretary of State] Antony Blinken -- might do something creative to help Ukraine.\"",
      "It appears unlikely that Biden's final months will bring Kyiv any closer to NATO membership. Ukrainian leaders are still pushing for an invitation to join the alliance despite fierce opposition from Russia -- and hesitance among key alliance members. Allies have repeatedly said that \"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" but even top officials in Kyiv acknowledge this cannot happen amid war with Moscow.",
      "The outgoing president may at least be able to ring fence much-needed funding for Kyiv.",
      "Matthew Savill of the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., said Biden \"might choose in his last months in office to use the remainder of the funding available for support to Ukraine under Presidential Drawdown Authority, amounting to over $5 billion.\"",
      "The Pentagon has already committed to rolling out new funding packages between now and January totaling some $9 billion. \"That is consistent with how we've been doing this in the past,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told journalists last week. \"It's something that we've done on a pretty regular, almost weekly, basis.\"",
      "Biden has also reportedly already decided to allow non-combat American defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair U.S.-provided weaponry.",
      "Yehor Cherniev -- a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chairman of his country's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly -- told ABC News that deeper sanctions on \"Putin's inner circle\" are on Kyiv's wish list, along with the delivery of all previously allocated aid, commitments for more, plus the end to restrictions on Western weapon use inside Russia.",
      "Trump has suggested he would quickly end Russia's invasion by threatening to cut off military aid to Kyiv unless it agrees to hand Moscow direct or indirect control of swaths of occupied territory in the south and east of the country.",
      "As such, his election has raised concerns in Ukraine of an imminent sellout.",
      "Merezhko, though, stressed the unpredictability of the president-elect. \"Trump might become even more critical of Russia to show that all suspicions about him are groundless,\" he said.",
      "\"We know that Trump loves his country and seeks to protect its interests in accordance with his vision,\" Cherniev said. \"Therefore, we are confident that the U.S. will not leave us alone with Russia, since this is not in the interests of the U.S. and the free world.\"",
      "\"However, much will depend on Putin's willingness to make concessions and compromises,\" he added. \"If the Russian dictator does not show due flexibility, I think Trump will increase his support for Ukraine.\"",
      "As to potential tensions between Trump and Biden in the coming months, Merezhko said, \"Competition between them will continue.\"",
      "\"For us, it would be better if they compete amongst themselves on who will do more for Ukraine.\"",
      "European nations, meanwhile, will be bracing for Trump while hoping to influence the president-elect's take on the war.",
      "Vinjamuri, of the Chatham House think tank, said Europeans will also be working closely with the Biden administration \"to put in place everything that they can to keep Europe and Ukraine in as good a place as possible before Jan. 20, when Trump comes in and tries to negotiate a peace deal.\"",
      "\"That means that getting Ukraine in the best position on the ground, because when you start negotiating a peace, a lot of what gets locked in is based on what land people hold,\" she said.",
      "The Biden administration's pre-election Middle East diplomatic push does not appear to have made significant breakthroughs in either Gaza or Lebanon. Fierce ground fighting and devastating Israeli airstrikes continue on both fronts, with the toll of civilian dead and displaced growing ever larger.",
      "The regional war began with Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel and saw around 250 taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel's military response in the strip has killed some 43,600 people and injured more than 102,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's airstrike and ground campaign in Lebanon has killed more than 3,000 since Oct. 8, 2023, Lebanese health officials say.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu replaced Defense Minister Yoav Gallant -- one of his prime political rivals and an advocate for a cease-fire deal -- on the eve of the U.S. election, reinforcing his position and entrenching his government's commitment to what he has called \"total victory.\"",
      "Hafed Al-Ghwell, senior fellow and executive director of the North Africa Initiative at the SAIS Foreign Policy Institute, Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News he has little expectation of peace during Biden's final months. \"I don't think he has any incentive to do anything,\" Hafed said.",
      "\"In the case of Israel and Palestine, Biden has taken not just a political stand but an ideological one, and there is no sign that he is going to change that,\" Hafed added. \"He has called himself a Zionist, and he had ample opportunity to stop this war. Even when the United Nations proposed a resolution to end the occupation, he didn't support it.\"",
      "\"It would be really controversial for an outgoing president to make any major decisions,\" he continued.",
      "Meanwhile, Netanyahu will be confident in the new White House's backing in his suppression of Palestinian and Lebanese groups, as well as in his wider showdown with Iran.",
      "Netanyahu \"probably feels like he has a free run,\" Vinjamuri said. \"Even if Biden tried to push him, I'm not so sure he would be responsive, because he knows that Trump is now coming into office.\"",
      "Hafed suggested Netanyahu's domestic concerns, too, will be driving his policy in the coming months. \"He knows that the minute this war stops, the Israeli public won't want him around,\" he said. \"So, he will continue the war in Lebanon and probably threaten Iran, knowing he will have the full support of Trump.\"",
      "Burcu Ozcelik at RUSI said the extent of Trump's influence over Netanyahu tops \"a complex list of unknowns.\"",
      "\"Trump in recent weeks indicated that he was prepared to give Israel freer rein, provided that the war ended by the time he entered office,\" he added.",
      "Those living in the region will be left grappling with the fallout, Hafed continued. \"For the people of the Middle East, Biden's legacy is one of a bloodbath,\" he said. \"The region is bitter and battered.\"",

      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Supreme Court declined Sunday to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with mail-in ballots, a day after voter rights groups cited reports of delays in vote counting and in notification of voters with problem signatures.",
      "The court said Sunday that election officials in eight of the state's 15 counties reported that all voters with \u201cinconsistent signatures\u201d had been properly notified and given an opportunity to respond.",
      "Arizona law calls for people who vote by mail to receive notice of problems such as a ballot signature that doesn\u2019t match one on file and get a \u201creasonable\u201d chance to correct it in a process known as \u201ccuring.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Court has no information to establish in fact that any such individuals did not have the benefit of \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 to cure their ballots,\u201d wrote Justice Bill Montgomery, who served as duty judge for the seven-member court.

      "\"I know it feels like the divided states of America over the last several years, but it is still the United States of America,\" said the influential radio host who supported Harris. \"We've got to unify in some way, shape or form.\"",
      "Charlamagne (n\u00e9 Lenard McKelvey) co-hosts the popular iHeart Radio program \"The Breakfast Club,\" which is heard by millions of monthly listeners, and is the author of the new book \"Be Honest or Die Lying.\"",
      "Harris joined Charlamagne for an audio town hall in October, where she discussed how her economic plan would boost Black communities and cast a Donald Trump presidency in dark terms.",
      "In an interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl on \"This Week,\" Charlamagne said he's \"optimistic\" about America regardless of Harris' loss.",
      "\"I do believe in the future of this country because I have no choice but to,\" he said.",
      "Following President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race and endorse Harris in August, Charlamagne applauded the vice president's candidacy for energizing the Democratic Party.",
      "Charlamagne said there was \"no life whatsoever\" with the Biden campaign and had previously called for him to not run for reelection.",
      "\"The vice president made a lot of people sit up on the couch and pay attention and at least be curious,\" he said. \"She has nothing to be ashamed of, she ran a great campaign\"",
      "In a stark demographic shift from 2020, Trump won one in three voters of color, notably gaining among Black and Latino voters. Charlamagne attributed part of this shift as \"a backlash to race and gender and identity politics.\"",
      "Trump improved his 2016 and 2020 numbers in traditional Democratic strongholds, like New Jersey and New Mexico. Charlamagne said that \"dinner table issues\" were top of mind for voters.",
      "\"Every day people wake up and all they want to do is have more money in their pocket and they want to feel safe,\" he said. \"I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, whatever religion you are, those are the two things that you're thinking about every day.\"",
      "He also said that Democrats \"didn't know how to message\" their stance on immigration, including the bipartisan border bill that Trump and his allies effectively killed.",
      "\"It's not like the Democrats didn't want border security. They just didn't know how to message it right,\" Charlamagne said. \"'Build the wall' may sound elementary, but you know what that signals to people? Border security.\"",

      "Some supporters of abortion still elected Trump in battleground states.",
      "Despite Kamala Harris' loss, pro-abortion rights activists are celebrating the results of the 2024 election, arguing that abortion rights won.",
      "\"When we look at the election results from this week, we saw voters in states that are really different from each other, in large majorities support abortion rights,\" Elisabeth Smith, the director of state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Abortion was a central issue in Harris's campaign as she sought to draw a stark difference between her vision for the country and President-elect Donald Trump's. But, exit polling shows some supporters of abortion rights still voted for Trump, despite Roe v. Wade being overturned as a result of his U.S. Supreme Court appointments.",
      "The battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada were among 10 states with abortion on the ballot Tuesday. Some strategists hypothesized that this would boost turnout among the majority of voters who support legal abortion, aiding Democratic candidates in the process.",
      "Trump's approach, focusing on states' rights, appeared to resonate with voters who didn't view abortion access as incompatible with a Trump presidency. In Arizona, 23% who voted \"yes\" on the state's initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution also voted for Trump. In Nevada, where another abortion rights measure was approved, 27% of \"yes\" voters elected Trump.",
      "This followed at the national level. Among the two-thirds of voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 28% voted for Trump; that included 30% in Arizona, 33% in Nevada and 36% in Florida.",
      "Supporters of legal abortion still broke strongly for Harris, but partisan elasticity on the issue did not cut both ways. As Harris made abortion access a central focus of her campaign, she won only 9% of voters who said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. In Arizona, anti-abortion voters made up 31% of the electorate and backed Trump by 95%.",
      "\"In thinking about what seems like a contradiction, research has shown that Americans -- when there is an abortion ballot or abortion-protecting constitutional amendment or initiative on the ballot -- they don't see abortion as a partisan issue,\" Smith said. \"Americans see abortion as an issue of liberty and of freedom.\"",
      "\"In 2022, 10% of voters in the state of Kentucky voted against the restrictive constitutional amendment that was on their ballot and for Rand Paul -- a senator who has made his opposition to abortion rights known,\" Smith said.",
      "Trump has also told voters that there won't be a federal abortion ban and it could be that voters were persuaded by him, Smith said.",
      "\"I don't think that people know that a federal abortion ban would preempt state constitutional protection. So I think there could also be this sense 'I'm voting yes on this amendment, and that means my state is fine,'\" Smith said.",
      "At least 14 states have ceased nearly all abortion services since Roe v. Wade was overturned. In total, 21 states have restrictions on abortion in effect.",
      "Seven of the 10 states with abortion on the ballot are projected to vote in favor of abortion rights while three states are projected to uphold abortion restrictions -- marking a first since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Six states previously voted in favor of abortion rights in the 2022 midterm elections.",
      "In Florida, 57% of voters voted in favor of enshrining protections for abortion rights in the state's constitution, but the measure failed to reach the 60% threshold it needed to pass. Still, abortion rights groups dubbed this measure a success, saying a majority of voters sided with abortion.",
      "\"Abortion won big,\" said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, at a press conference Wednesday. \"If not for the rigged rules and for the very intentional and purposeful efforts to confuse and mislead voters and change the goal post and change the rules, abortion access would have won, certainly in Florida but in Nebraska and South Dakota too.\"",
      "In Nebraska, two contradicting abortion-related amendments on the ballot confused voters, likely contributing to the failure of the initiative, Smith argued.",
      "\"There is research, outside of the abortion context, but about ballot initiatives that show that when voters are confronted with two choices on the same question, that creates a lot of confusion about what people are voting for. And in Nebraska, when signatures were being collected, there were voters who alleged that they were told they were signing the abortion rights petition and later found out they had signed the petition against abortion rights,\" Smith said.",
      "Despite the success of ballot initiatives, advocates need to make it more understandable to people that their elected officials greatly determine their ability to access reproductive healthcare like abortion, Kelly Baden, the Guttmacher Institute's vice president of policy told ABC News in an interview.",
      "\"Women are dying from these abortion bans. And so unfortunately, to to see that that reality wasn't sufficient for people to fully prioritize abortion rates up and down the ballot in every way possible is it's a tough pill to swallow,\" Baden said.",
      "\"Seven states did soundly declare their support for abortion, active rights via ballot measures and I think there's a bigger conversation of how and why people are able to make that make sense in their own voting patterns. That is a problem that predates Trump,\" Baden said.",

      "Advocates warn that a federal abortion ban could be on the horizon.",
      "Despite celebrating the passing of abortion-related ballot initiatives in seven states, abortion rights advocates warn that a second Donald Trump presidency puts nationwide access to abortion care in danger.",
      "\"An already harmful abortion access crisis will likely get worse,\" Kelly Baden, the vice president of policy at the Guttmacher Institute, told ABC News.",
      "\"The 13 states that currently ban abortion -- there are real consequences to that including death. Women are dying from these abortion bans,\" Baden said.",
      "Trump may have persuaded voters that there won't be a federal abortion ban, but experts warn nationwide access could be at risk.",
      "\"I don't think that people know that a federal abortion ban would preempt state constitutional protection. There could also be this sense that, 'I'm voting yes on this amendment, and that means my state is fine,'\" Elisabeth Smith, the director of state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told ABC News.",
      "\"A federal abortion ban -- if the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to take effect -- would preempt the policy of a state where abortion is legal and accessible,\" Smith said. \"We don't yet know which party controls the House [of Representatives], but that is a possibility.\"",
      "The regulation of federal agencies could also impact access to abortion care. Medication abortion could come under fire if the Food and Drug Administration -- under a Trump presidency -- limits access to mifepristone, one of the pills used in the regimen to terminate pregnancy, or rolls back its approval, as anti-abortion groups have tried to do.",
      "The Trump administration could also attempt to misuse the Comstock Act to try to prevent access to medication abortion, Smith warned.",
      "The 150-year-old law is an anti-obscenity law \"makes it a crime to mail anything that\u2019s 'indecent, filthy, or vile' or 'intended for producing abortion,'\" according to\u00a0the ACLU.",
      "Ballot initiatives",
      "Missouri became the first state with a near-total abortion ban in effect to approve a pro-abortion rights initiative since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion rights.",
      "If the ban is repealed as expected, Missouri could facilitate closer access to abortion care for women in the South. The state borders four states that have ceased nearly all abortion services -- Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma.",
      "But, there is not currently a single brick-and-mortar abortion clinic in Missouri which means that even when the law is repealed, it would still take time for access to care to resume, according to Baden.",
      "\"So, we'll continue to see people having to leave the state for clinician-provided abortion care or to find another way to get care in the meantime,\" Baden said.",
      "The legal proceeding to overturn the state's ban under the new constitutional amendment could also take months to years, according to Baden.",
      "The battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada were also among 10 states with abortion on the ballot Tuesday. Some strategists hypothesized that this would boost turnout among the majority of voters who support legal abortion, aiding Democratic candidates in the process.",
      "But, exit polling showed that some supporters of abortion still elected Trump in battleground states.",
      "Advocates warn that while ballot initiatives have proved effective, they are not a universal solution.",
      "\"They are just one tool in the toolbox. They are clearly not our silver bullet, both, because structurally they can't be. Not every state even allows for ballot measures like that, they're expensive and they also are not an immediate solution ... a series of litigation has to happen,\"",
      "Advocates for abortion-care-related protections said they will continue to work to restore and protect access to abortion care under the incoming administration.",
      "\"It is our task to hold this incoming administration to its word that it will not work to further restrict or ban abortion and we will hold them to their insistence that they will invest in caregiving,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center Action Fund, told reporters during a press conference Wednesday.",

    "title": "How important was health, reproductive care in the election? Not very, say experts",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 20:41:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite concerns about the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights, health care was not a major voting issue in this election, experts tell ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of abortion rights ballot initiatives also voted for Trump.",
      "Americans who voted to elect Donald Trump the 47th president in Tuesday night's election expressed concerns about several major issues, including the state of democracy, the economy, immigration and foreign policy.",
      "The state of democracy in particular was the most important issue to voters, with 35% saying as much according to an ABC News preliminary exit poll, followed by 31% who said the economy was the most important issue to them.",
      "Health care, however, did not seem to be a major voting issue for many Americans. Though abortion, for example, was among the top five voting issues, only 14% said it was their most important issue, the exit poll showed.",
      "Experts told ABC News that despite concerns about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and further restrictions on abortion rights, other issues were top of mind for Americans.",
      "\"Health care issues are always a concern to people, but certainly there were other issues that were more important to people at this time,\" Dr. Perry Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health at Rutgers University in New Jersey, told ABC News. \"It seemed like the economy and migration were the biggest issues, but especially the economy. People expressed very serious concerns about prices, very serious concerns about the affordability of things, very serious concerns about inflation.\"",
      "\"And those surpassed concerns about health care access and or reproductive rights, and many people voted based on their pocketbooks instead of their health care rights and access,\" Halkitis continued.",
      "Affordable Care Act",
      "During his first term, then-President Trump tried several times to repeal the ACA but was unsuccessful. He was promising as late November 2023 to replace it, saying Republicans \"should never give up\" trying.",
      "However, throughout 2024, Trump said on several occasions, both on social media and during the presidential debate, that he wanted to make the ACA \"better\" rather than replace it.",
      "Ultimately, worries about heath care and potential changes to the ACA didn't even crack the top five voting issues in ABC News exit polls.",
      "Halkitis said he doesn't think there will be radical changes to the ACA during Trump's second term because it's \"baked into people's lives.\" However, he does worry about legislation or policies that could limit the types of services that are available from health care providers, as opposed to a complete repeal or dismantling of the ACA.",
      "\"One example is that in the state of Texas, about a year ago, the district court decided that the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is the use of one pill once a day to prevent HIV, did not have to be covered by insurance of a particular company,\" Halkitis said. \"I think things like that that speak to people's beliefs, whether correct or incorrect, [that] may affect the kinds of health care services that are provided to people, if the president-elect is to make any changes to the Affordable Care Act.\"",
      "Another example is the federal contraceptive coverage guarantee. Under a provision of the ACA, most private insurance plans must cover the full cost of most contraceptives, such as birth control, without making patients pay out-of-pocket costs.",
      "If the incoming Trump administration allows employers and schools to use religious and moral exemptions to prevent coverage of contraceptives, as the White House did during Trump's first term, this may lead to out-of-pocket costs that make contraceptives unaffordable to some, some experts told ABC News.",
      "Also at risk could be those with preexisting conditions. Under the ACA, insurers cannot charge more or deny coverage to someone or their child because of a preexisting health condition. However, Vice President-elect JD Vance has suggested placing people with chronic conditions into separate risk pools, which could raise premiums for those with preexisting conditions.",
      "\"I hope that doesn't happen because that would actually be disastrous for so many millions of Americans,\" Halkitis said. \"What I think would happen is that, if they were to modify the preexisting conditions clause, and put the people in a different bracket, is that it may become unaffordable for people to have health insurance.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, professor and chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Georgia, said he thinks voters in future elections will be motivated to go to the polls if they see modifications to the ACA.",
      "For example, Patrick said public opinion is generally favorable for provisions such as parents being able to keep their children on their insurance plans until age 26, as a 2019 KFF Health Tracking Poll found, which may have inspired people to go to the polls in past elections.",
      "\"We know that as you start to make modifications to things like the Affordable Care Act, people do care as we start to modify things, or change things when it affects their health insurance,\" Patrick told ABC News. \"If you say to someone, 'keeping your kid on your health insurance until they're 26,' people generally are in favor of those types of policies.\"",
      "Reproductive rights",
      "Some political strategists believed that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overruling Roe v. Wade would drive voters who support abortion rights to the polls to vote for Kamala Harris. Trump himself took credit for the ruling, boasting that he \"was able to kill Roe v. Wade.\"",
      "While supporters of legal abortion still broke strongly for Harris, Trump's approach focusing on states' rights appeared to resonate with voters who didn't view abortion access as incompatible with a Trump presidency.",
      "In Arizona, 23% who voted \"yes\" on the state's initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution also voted for Trump. In Nevada, where another abortion-rights measure was approved, 25% of \"yes\" voters likewise went for Trump, according to the ABC News exit poll.",
      "\"I think what we're seeing [in] the exit polls is that abortion was a very important issue among many, many voters. However, those voters did not all vote for Kamala Harris,\" Dr. Leslie Kantor, professor and chair of the Department of Urban Global Public Health at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"I think that there was actually a certain amount of confusion, which was sown pretty deliberately by the Trump-Vance campaign in the final weeks, trying to convince people that, in fact, they don't oppose abortion, when the track record clearly shows that they do.\"",
      "Kantor said this is evident in statements by Trump and Vance in which they said the president-elect would veto a national abortion ban if it came across his desk, or in comments by Trump in which he said he would not use the 150-year-old Comstock Act to ban mail delivery of abortion medication.",
      "Kantor noted that, despite Trump expressing pride for appointing justices to the Supreme Court to overrule Roe v. Wade, he was less vocal about abortion rights on the campaign trail.",
      "\"In 2024, when people are seeing the devastating consequences of the overturn [sic] of Roe v. Wade, he really backed away from that position and was much less clear, and voters were clearly less clear,\" she said. \"Because when you see somebody who says, 'I think abortion should be legal in most cases,' and then voting for somebody who clearly does not believe abortion should be legal, you know that people have been confused.\"",
      "Preliminary exit poll results from ABC News show that abortion was an important voting issue for young women, with about 19% of all women voters saying it was their most important issue, rising to 42% among women younger than 30.",
      "Kantor further noted that she thinks young women are scared after reading news reports about women pushed to the brink of death or dying after medical care was denied because physicians were hesitant to act due to restrictions to state abortion laws. She added that some abortion care providers are also leaving states where abortion care is restricted.",
      "\"Young women are terrified about what's happening all around the country,\" Kantor said. \"The truth is it isn't even safe to have a wanted pregnancy in this country. \u2026So, I think young women are staring at 30 years, possibly 25 years, of having to manage their sexual and reproductive health with very few providers and very few rights.\"",
      "It may be difficult to access abortion services even in states where care is now legal. In Missouri, voters enshrined the right to reproductive freedom in the state's constitution, effectively ending the state's restrictive ban. However, abortion for now remains unavailable in the state.",
      "\"Access to services is incredibly restricted and, at some point, having a right is meaningless if you can't actually get the service,\" Kantor said.",

      "That may make for an awkward encounter, especially given that, after Biden ousted Trump in 2020, Trump offered no such White House invitation to Biden. Trump even left Washington before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, becoming the first president to do so since Andrew Johnson skipped the 1869 swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "Biden also has the unusual distinction of having beaten Trump in one cycle and run against him for about 15 months during this year\u2019s campaign. As he sought reelection, Biden constantly decried Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values before leaving the race in July and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who took on her own campaign and lost on Election Day.",
      "When the two meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it\u2019ll technically be the first time since 1992 that an outgoing president sits down with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign. Back then, Republican President George H.W. Bush met with Democrat and President-elect Bill Clinton about two weeks after they squared off on Election Day.",
      "Bush and Clinton talked policy before going together to the Roosevelt Room to meet with their transition staff. Clinton later called the meeting \u201cterrific\u201d and said Bush was \u201cvery helpful.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, such handoff meetings between outgoing presidents and their replacements have been by turns friendly, tense and somewhere in between.",
      "This time, Biden has vowed to ensure a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working with Trump, who is both his presidential predecessor and successor, to bring the country together. Biden\u2019s White House invitation to Trump includes his wife, the former and now incoming first lady, Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cI assured him that I\u2019d direct my entire administration to work with his team,\u201d Biden said of the call with Trump when he made the invitation. The president-elect \u201clooks forward to the meeting,\" spokesman Steven Cheung said.",
      "Jim Bendat, a historian and author of \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,\u201d called face-to-face chats between outgoing and incoming presidents \u201chealthy for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that the Democrats have chosen to take the high road and returned to the traditions that really do make America great,\u201d Bendat said.",
      "This year's meeting won't be uncharted territory for Trump.",
      "He and then-Democratic President Barack Obama held a longer-than-scheduled 90-minute Oval Office discussion days after the 2016 election. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also showed Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner around the West Wing.",
      "\u201cWe now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Obama told Trump, despite the president-elect being fresh off a victory that dented the outgoing president\u2019s legacy.",
      "Trump appeared nervous and was unusually subdued, calling Obama \u201ca good man\u201d and the meeting \u201ca great honor.\u201d He said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Obama and that they \u201cdiscussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties.\u201d",
      "\u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Trump said. Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the meeting as \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d and he noted that the two \u201cdid not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "In fact, that encounter went smoothly enough to reassure a few Trump critics that he might grow into the job and become more presidential in temperament and action \u2014 an assessment quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s unique relish of bombast and political conflict once his administration began, particularly when it came to his predecessor.",
      "Only about four months later, Trump accused Obama \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower before the 2016 election. On social media, he blasted the former president for engaging in \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and decrying it as \u201cNixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d",
      "Obama aides now say that while the 2016 Trump-Obama meeting went well publicly, the incoming president's team ignored most of the transition process and did not have the same reverence for the White House and federal institutions that they or Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s team had.",
      "One recalled that the only question Trump counterparts asked at the time was not about the coming workload or responsibilities, but how best to find an apartment in Washington.",
      "The official transition process does not mandate that presidents invite their successors to face-to-face meetings, though it can feel that way.",
      "\u201cThe psychological transfer occurs then,\" former Vice President Walter Mondale once said.",
      "There's no record of George Washington scheduling a formal meeting with the nation's second president, John Adams, before leaving the then-capital city of New York. And Adams, after moving into the White House during his term, never invited his political rival and successor, Thomas Jefferson, over before leaving without attending Jefferson's inauguration in 1801.",
      "Still, by 1841, President Martin Van Buren hosted President-elect William Henry Harrison \u2014 who had soundly beaten him on Election Day \u2014 for dinner at the White House. He even later offered to leave the official residence early to make room for his successor after Washington's National Hotel, where Harrison had been staying, became overcrowded. Harrison instead made a brief, preinaugural trip to Virginia.",
      "More recently, Republican George W. Bush welcomed Obama to the White House in 2008 after calling the election of the nation's first Black president a \u201ctriumph of the American story.\u201d",
      "And eight years prior, Bush himself was the newcomer when he met with the outgoing Clinton, who had denied his father a second term. Their chat came just eight days after the Supreme Court resolved the disputed 2000 election, and Bush also later headed to the vice presidential residence to briefly talk with the man he defeated, Al Gore.",
      "Bush and Gore didn't say what they discussed, though vice presidential press aide Jim Kennedy described the conversation as meant to \u2033demonstrate that this is a country where we put aside our differences after a long and difficult campaign.\u2033",
      "Trump and Harris spoke by phone this past week but don't have a face-to-face meeting planned."

      "Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change Senate rules and give him more power to appoint unconfirmed nominees",
      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.",
      "Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.",
      "Trump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled \u201cIMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president\u2019s power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief \u201cpro-forma\u201d sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.",
      "But with Trump\u2019s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, \u201c100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\u201d And Thune said in a statement that they must \u201cquickly and decisively\u201d act to get nominees in place and that \u201call options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.\u201d",
      "Cornyn said that \u201cIt is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump \u2019s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.\u201d He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.",
      "The social media exchange on Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress \u2014 especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations \u2014 was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump also posted on Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year \u2014 a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold the majority of votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that \u201cDemocrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\u201d",
      "With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.",
      "Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott \u2014 a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and fierce ally \u2014 has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump\u2019s ear.",
      "\u201cWe have to be the change,\u201d Scott said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\" \u201cThat\u2019s what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.\u201d",
      "All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d behind closed doors.",
      "As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump\u2019s Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that there are \u201ca couple of great options on the table.\u201d Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance \u201cthe positions that President Trump has articulated.\u201d",

      "Here\u2019s a look at how the AP called this race:",
      "CANDIDATES: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green).",
      "WINNER: Trump.",
      "POLL CLOSING TIME: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.",
      "ABOUT THE RACE: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day.",
      "Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.",
      "Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018.",
      "Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years.",
      "Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.",
      "WHY AP CALLED THE RACE:",
      "In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.",
      "Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far underperformed Biden\u2019s showing from 2020.",
      "She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic candidates in recent elections.",
      "Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then.",
      "The AP\u2019s analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.",

      "The Arizona Supreme Court has declined an emergency request to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with mail-in ballots",
      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Supreme Court declined Sunday to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with mail-in ballots, a day after voter rights groups cited reports of delays in vote counting and in notification of voters with problem signatures.",
      "The court said Sunday that election officials in eight of the state's 15 counties reported that all voters with \u201cinconsistent signatures\u201d had been properly notified and given an opportunity to respond.",
      "Arizona law calls for people who vote by mail to receive notice of problems such as a ballot signature that doesn\u2019t match one on file and get a \u201creasonable\u201d chance to correct it in a process known as \u201ccuring.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Court has no information to establish in fact that any such individuals did not have the benefit of \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 to cure their ballots,\u201d wrote Justice Bill Montgomery, who served as duty judge for the seven-member court. He noted that no responding county requested a time extension.",
      "\"In short, there is no evidence of disenfranchisement before the Court,\u201d the court order said.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and the Campaign Legal Center on Saturday named registrars including Stephen Richer in Maricopa County in a petition asking for an emergency court order to extend the original 5 p.m. MST Sunday deadline by up to four days. Maricopa is the state\u2019s most populous county and includes Phoenix.",
      "The groups said that as of Friday evening, more than 250,000 mail-in ballots had not yet been verified by signature, with the bulk of those in Maricopa County. They argued that tens of thousands of Arizona voters could be disenfranchised.",
      "Montgomery, a Republican appointed to the state high court in 2019 by GOP former Gov. Doug Ducey, said the eight counties that responded \u2014 including Maricopa \u2014 said \u201call such affected voters\u201d received at least one telephone call \u201calong with other messages by emails, text messages or mail.\u201d",
      "He noted, however, that the Navajo Nation advised the court that the list of tribe members in Apache County who needed to cure their ballots on Saturday was more than 182 people.",
      "Maricopa County reported early Sunday that it had about 202,000 ballots yet to be counted. The Arizona Secretary of State reported that more than 3 million ballots were cast in the election."

      "A Manhattan judge is poised to decide whether to uphold Donald Trump's hush money verdict or dismiss it on presidential immunity grounds",
      "NEW YORK -- A gut punch for most defendants, Donald Trump turned his criminal conviction into a rallying cry. His supporters put \u201cI\u2019m Voting for the Felon\u201d on T-shirts, hats and lawn signs.",
      "\u201cThe real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people,\u201d Trump proclaimed after his conviction in New York last spring on 34 counts of falsifying business records.",
      "Now, just a week after Trump's resounding election victory, a Manhattan judge is poised to decide whether to uphold the hush money verdict or dismiss it because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July that gave presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution.",
      "Judge Juan M. Merchan has said he will issue a written opinion Tuesday on Trump's request to toss his conviction and either order a new trial or dismiss the indictment entirely.",
      "Merchan had been expected to rule in September, but put it off \u201cto avoid any appearance\u201d he was trying to sway the election. His decision could be on ice again if Trump takes other steps to delay or end the case.",
      "If the judge upholds the verdict, the case would be on track for sentencing Nov. 26 \u2014 though that could shift or vanish depending on appeals or other legal maneuvers.",
      "Trump's lawyers have been fighting for months to reverse his conviction, which involved efforts to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to disrupt his 2016 campaign.",
      "Trump denies her claim, maintains he did nothing wrong and has decried the verdict as a \u201crigged, disgraceful\u201d result of a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d meant to harm his campaign.",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling gives former presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts \u2014 things they do as part of their job as president \u2014 and bars prosecutors from using evidence of official acts in trying to prove that purely personal conduct violated the law.",
      "Trump was a private citizen \u2014 campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in \u2014 when his then-lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016.",
      "But Trump was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. Those reimbursements, jurors found, were falsely logged in Trump\u2019s records as legal expenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers contend the Manhattan district attorney's office \u201ctainted\u201d the case with evidence \u2014 including testimony about Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 that shouldn\u2019t have been allowed.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the high court's ruling provides \u201cno basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Trump's conviction, they said, involved unofficial acts \u2014 personal conduct for which he is not immune.",
      "The Supreme Court didn't define an official act, leaving that to lower courts. Nor did it make clear how its ruling \u2014 which arose from one of Trump's two federal criminal cases \u2014 pertains to state-level cases like Trump's hush money prosecution.",
      "\u201cThere are several murky aspects of the court\u2019s ruling, but one that is particularly relevant to this case is the issue of what counts as an official act,\" said George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s extremely difficult to argue that this payoff to this woman does qualify as an official act, for a number of fairly obvious reasons.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to erase the verdict have taken on new urgency since his election, with a sentencing date looming at the end of the month and possible punishments ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.",
      "Presidents-elect don't typically enjoy the same legal protections as presidents, but Trump and his lawyers could try to leverage his unique status as a former and future commander-in-chief into something of a \u201cGet Out of Jail Free\u201d card.",
      "One likely argument: Trump wouldn't just be saving himself from a potential prison sentence, he'd be sparing the nation from the calamity of its leader behind bars \u2014 however remote that possibility is.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll ask every court in the world to intervene if he can, including the Supreme Court, so that could drag things out a bit,\u201d said Syracuse University law professor David Driesen, author of the book, \u201cThe Specter of Dictatorship: Judicial Enabling of Presidential Power.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Trump has been attempting to again move the case from state court to federal court, where he could also assert immunity. His lawyers have asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse a judge\u2019s September ruling denying the transfer.",
      "If Merchan orders a new trial, it seems unlikely that could happen while Trump is in office.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in court papers that, given the Supreme Court ruling, jurors shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to hear about matters including his conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks, nor another aide's testimony about his work practices.",
      "Also verboten, they said, was prosecutors\u2019 use of Trump\u2019s 2018 financial disclosure report, which he was required as president to file. A footnote mentioned that Trump reimbursed Cohen in 2017 for unspecified expenses the year before.",
      "Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued that prosecutors were trying \u201cto assign a criminal motive\u201d to some of Trump\u2019s actions in office to \u201cunfairly prejudice\u201d him. For example, they wrote, prosecutors pushed the \u201cdubious theory\" that some of Trump's 2018 tweets were part of a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d to keep Cohen from turning on him.",
      "The immunity decision \u201cforecloses inquiry into those motives,\u201d Blanche and Bove wrote.",
      "Prosecutors countered that the ruling doesn\u2019t apply to the evidence in question, and that regardless, it\u2019s \u201conly a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof\u201d the jury considered."

      "His list includes starting up the mass deportation of migrants, rolling back Biden administration policies on education, reshaping the federal government by firing potentially thousands of federal employees he believes are secretly working against him, and pardoning people who were arrested for their role in the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\u201cI want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,\" he said of his Day 1 plans.",
      "When he took office in 2017, he had a long list, too, including immediately renegotiating trade deals, deporting migrants and putting in place measures to root out government corruption. Those things didn't happen all at once.",

      "Here's a look at what Trump has said he will do in his second term and whether he can do it the moment he steps into the White House:",
      "Trump has said that \u201cwithin two seconds\" of taking office that he would fire Jack Smith, the special counsel who has been prosecuting two federal cases against him. Smith is already evaluating how to wind down the cases because of long-standing Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted.",
      "Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.",
      "Trump cannot pardon himself when it comes to his state conviction in New York in a hush money case, but he could seek to leverage his status as president-elect in an effort to set aside or expunge his felony conviction and stave off a potential prison sentence.",
      "A case in Georgia, where Trump was charged with election interference, will likely be the only criminal case left standing. It would probably be put on hold until at least 2029, at the end of his presidential term. The Georgia prosecutor on the case just won reelection.",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged since a mob of Trump supporters spun up by the outgoing president attacked the Capitol almost nearly four years ago.",
      "Trump launched his general election campaign in March by not merely trying to rewrite the history of that riot, but positioning the violent siege and failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House. As part of that, he called the rioters \u201cunbelievable patriots\u201d and promised to help them \u201cthe first day we get into office.\u201d",
      "As president, Trump can pardon anyone convicted in federal court, District of Columbia Superior Court or in a military court-martial. He can stop the continued prosecution of rioters by telling his attorney general to stand down.",
      "\u201cI am inclined to pardon many of them,\" Trump said on his social media platform in March when announcing the promise. \u201cI can\u2019t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\u201d",
      "Trump could begin the process of stripping tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections, so they could be more easily fired.",
      "He wants to do two things: drastically reduce the federal workforce, which he has long said is an unnecessary drain, and to \u201ctotally obliterate the deep state\u201d \u2014 perceived enemies who, he believes, are hiding in government jobs.",
      "Within the government, there are hundreds of politically appointed professionals who come and go with administrations. There also are tens of thousands of \u201ccareer\u201d officials, who work under Democratic and Republican presidents. They are considered apolitical workers whose expertise and experience help keep the government functioning, particularly through transitions.",
      "Trump wants the ability to convert some of those career people into political jobs, making them easier to dismiss and replace with loyalists. He would try to accomplish that by reviving a 2020 executive order known as \u201cSchedule F.\u201d The idea behind the order was to strip job protections from federal workers and create a new class of political employees. It could affect roughly 50,000 of 2.2 million civilian federal employees.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden rescinded the order when he took office in January 2021. But Congress failed to pass a bill protecting federal employees. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal government\u2019s chief human resources agency, finalized a rule last spring against reclassifying workers, so Trump might have to spend months \u2014 or even years \u2014 unwinding it.",
      "Trump has said he has a particular focus on \u201ccorrupt bureaucrats who have weaponized our justice system\u201d and \u201ccorrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus.\u201d",
      "Beyond the firings, Trump wants to crack down on government officials who leak to reporters. He also wants to require that federal employees pass a new civil service test.",
      "Trump promised throughout the campaign to impose tariffs on imported goods, particularly those from China. He argued that such import taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the United States, shrink the federal deficit and help lower food prices. He also cast them as central to his national security agenda.",
      "\u201cTariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\" Trump said during a September rally in Flint, Michigan.",
      "The size of his pledged tariffs varied. He proposed at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, a 60% import tax on goods from China and a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico \u2014 if not more.",
      "Trump would likely not need Congress to impose these tariffs, as was clear in 2018, when he imposed them on steel and aluminum imports without going through lawmakers by citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That law, according to the Congressional Research Service, gives a president the power to adjust tariffs on imports that could affect U.S. national security, an argument Trump has made.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re being invaded by Mexico,\u201d Trump said at a rally in North Carolina this month. Speaking about the new president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m going to inform her on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Trump said during the campaign that he would roll back Biden administration action seeking to protect transgender students from discrimination in schools on the first day of his new administration.",
      "Opposition to transgender rights was central to the Trump campaign\u2019s closing argument. His campaign ran an ad in the final days of the race against Vice President Kamala Harris in which a narrator said: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration announced new Title IX protections in April that made clear treating transgender students differently from their classmates is discrimination. Trump responded by saying he would roll back those changes, pledging to do some on the first day of his new administration and specifically noting he has the power to act without Congress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end it on Day 1,\u201d Trump said in May. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we\u2019re going to change it \u2014 on Day 1 it\u2019s going to be changed.\u201d",
      "It is unlikely Trump will stop there.",
      "Speaking at a Wisconsin rally in June, Trump said \u201con Day 1\" he would \u201csign a new executive order\u201d that would cut federal money for any school \u201cpushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the lives of our children.\u201d",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t said how he would try to cut schools\u2019 federal money, and any widespread rollback would require action from Congress.",
      "Trump is looking to reverse climate policies aimed at reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "With an executive order on Day 1, he can roll back environmental protections, halt wind projects, scuttle the Biden administration's targets that encourage the switch to electric cars and abolish standards for companies to become more environmentally friendly.",
      "He has pledged to increase production of U.S. fossil fuels, promising to \u201cdrill, drill, drill,\" when he gets into office on Day 1 and seeking to open the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he claims would lower energy costs.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day.",
      "When asked to respond to the claim, Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said \u201cthe Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\u201d",
      "Leavitt, the Trump press secretary, told Fox News after Trump on Wednesday was declared the winner of the election that he would now be able to \u201cnegotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.\u201d She later said, \u201cIt includes, on Day 1, bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table to end this war.\u201d",
      "Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. Trump, who makes no secret of his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has criticized the Biden administration for giving money to Ukraine to fight the war.",
      "At a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I\u2019ll have that done \u2014 I\u2019ll have that done in 24 hours.\u201d He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin.",
      "Speaking last month at his Madison Square Garden rally in New York, Trump said: \u201cOn Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, then kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible.\u201d",
      "In one of his first personnel announcements, Trump announced via social media late Sunday that he would put Tom Homan, his former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,\u201d a central part of his agenda.",
      "Trump can direct his administration to begin the effort the minute he arrives in office, but it's much more complicated to actually deport the nearly 11 million people who are believed to be in the United States illegally. That would require a huge, trained law enforcement force, massive detention facilities, airplanes to move people and nations willing to accept them.",
      "Trump has said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act.

    "story": [
      "Two Canadians who served with the U.N. peacekeeping force in divided Cyprus have shared their recollections of their tour of duty with The Associated Press",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- It was the first time that Canadian UN peacekeeper Michelle Angela Hamelin said she came up against the raw emotion of a people so exasperated with their country\u2019s predicament.",
      "On an eight-month tour of duty on ethnically divided Cyprus in 1986, the fury of Greek Cypriot protesters demonstrating against the first-ever visit by a Turkish head of government to the island\u2019s breakaway Turkish Cypriot north was seared in her memory.",
      "\u201cI think that that was something that really stuck to my mind because of that anger and the people,\u201d Hamelin told The Associated Press.",
      "She was one of among 100 other Canadian veterans who travelled to Cyprus as part of commemorations that culminated Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the U.N. peacekeeping force (UNFICYP), the longest such Canadian mission.",
      "\u201cAnd this was the first time I was confronted with people that were really, really upset with their situation that they were in.\u201d",
      "At the time, it had been a dozen years after a Turkish invasion \u2014 triggered by a coup aiming at union with Greece \u2014 sliced the island along ethnic lines and tensions were still high.",
      "UNFICYP had been in place since 1964, a decade prior to the invasion, deployed to tamp down hostilities between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to prevent an all-out civil war. Canadians were among the first to join the force and more than 28,000 would eventually serve with UNFICYP. Canada withdrew almost all its peacekeepers from UNFICYP in 1993, but a Canadian presence still remains. Some 28 lost their lives in the line of duty.",
      "Through most of 1986, it was Hamelin\u2019s job was to patrol the U.N.-controlled buffer zone that separated troops on either side of the divide in the medieval center of the capital, Nicosia, staying in the once luxurious Ledra Palace hotel that had been converted into a UN barracks.",
      "The hotel\u2019s bullet-pockmarked sandstone walls were a constant reminder that a flare-up in hostilities could never be ruled out.",
      "\"And knowing that the Turkish side where I stayed was right there underneath my window at Ledra Palace. And you got bullet holes above your bed. There\u2019s a possibility this could happen again,\u201d she recalled.",
      "It didn\u2019t. Hamelin said her Canadian colleagues would often muster all their diplomatic skills with jittery soldiers to keep tensions from escalating.",
      "Ronald Reginald Griffis could attest to that trademark, calm Canadian demeanor that earned the country\u2019s peacekeepers a reputation for even-handedness and ability to quickly defuse tensions.",
      "Griffis was one of the first Canadians to serve in UNFICYP back in 1964 and he recalled how he would employ that cool Canadian way to settle disputes along the so-called Green Line that separated Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot neighborhoods inside old Nicosia.",
      "\u201cOne of the qualities was the quietness of the Canadians. They listened, or at least I listened. And then, you know, you talk it over. You try to explain things,\u201d said Griffis, a native of Nova Scotia who now lives in Cottam, Ontario.",
      "\u201cAnd I thought that they appreciated Canadians being there, and I think they trusted the Canadians doing what they can do.\u201d",
      "More than 100 active-duty Canadian Armed forces personnel, dispatched to Cyprus to assist in possible evacuations of Canadians from nearby Lebanon, joined Hamelin, Griffis and other veterans for a Remembrance Day ceremony at the Canadian UN Peacekeeper Memorial inside the buffer zone near the Ledra Palace hotel.",
      "Canada\u2019s High Commissioner to Cyprus, Anna-Karine Asselin, said the size of the delegation at the commemoration event illustrated the \u201cdeep significance of the mission\u201d for Canadian veterans.",
      "\u201cWe pay tribute to their invaluable contribution to peace. We recognize the challenges they faced along the way,\u201d Asselin said.",
      "A few days earlier, Hamelin and Griffis had joined a tour of the buffer zone that reawakened many recollections.",
      "Both spoke of the changes between Cyprus then and now \u2014 from donkey carts in the capital's streets in 1964 to a thoroughly modern European Union member state 60 years later.",
      "But for Hamelin, no matter how much things have changed in Cyprus, they remain much the same.",
      "\u201cI see how built up this is now in Nicosia. But it\u2019s still the same. We still have that division and it\u2019s very, very it\u2019s in your face,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 06:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers. If a signal is not strong enough, it can be boosted by an aerial.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies and no such fix is available.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",
      "The truth about smart meters",
      "Smart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story?",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).",
      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",

      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:22:40 GMT",
    "summary": "They can cost hundreds of pounds, but are these products actually worth the money?",
    "story": [
      "They\u2019re all over your TikTok and Instagram \u2013 people unboxing the latest extravagant beauty advent calendar.",
      "Influencers excitedly wonder what eyeliner, serum or hand cream will be behind door one, and gush over the beautiful box it has come in.",
      "But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money?",
      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma.",
      "\"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\"",
      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",
      "\"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\""

      "UK exports to the world could fall more than 2.6% due to lower trade with the US and knock-on effects globally, economists at the University of Sussex's Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy (CITP) said.",
      "This fall could happen if the President-elect went through with his repeated campaign promise to levy a 20% tax on all imports, and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "The decline in trade would be the equivalent of an annual hit to UK economic output of 0.8%.",
      "Although Trump's aggressive pledges could be a negotiating tactic, the \"possibility of these tariffs being imposed is certainly there\", researcher Nicolo Tamberi said in a blog post.",
      "The main UK sectors likely to be hit would be fishing, petroleum, and mining, which could see exports fall by around a fifth.",
      "The pharmaceutical and electrical sectors would also be hit.",

      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "Last week, the government announced that \u00a31.8bn has been set aside for people affected by the Horizon IT  scandal, in addition to various compensation schemes already announced.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts.",
      "Sir Alan, portrayed in a ITV drama which thrust the scandal back into the spotlight earlier this year, leads the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance and was giving evidence to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday.",
      "The hearing is considering fast and fair redress for victims of the Post Office scandal and a key point for Sir Alan, which he has made before, is that the government needs to set deadlines for compensation to be paid.",
      "He told MPs he had twice written to the prime minister in the past month to say \"it needs to be finished by the end of March 2025\".",
      "A No10 spokesman said the PM responded to Sir Alan earlier on Tuesday, and added the government is committed to getting quick redress for victims, but is wary of setting an \"arbitrary cut-off\" date that could see some claimants miss out.",
      "\u201cWe want redress as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"What we don\u2019t want to do is set an absolute cut-off date which would result in some claimants missing the deadline.",
      "\"But each postmaster eligible should receive substantial redress by the end of March.\"",
      "Campaigners have criticised the amount of time it is taking for those affected to receive compensation. Many sub-postmasters were wrongly sent to prison for false accounting and theft, and several more were financially ruined. Some have died waiting for justice.",
      "The PM's spokesperson said as of 31 October, approximately \u00a3438m had been paid to more than 3,100 claimants across the four compensation schemes.",
      "'Like a battle'",
      "Janet Skinner, now in her 50s, is still waiting for her compensation. Her claim has been in the system for more than two years.",

      "She was handed a nine-month sentence in 2007 over an alleged shortfall of \u00a359,000 from her Post Office branch in Bransholme, Hull.",
      "She served three months in prison before being released with an electronic tag, but eventually had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021.",
      "The stress of the scandal left her with neurological problems, leading to paralysis in parts of her body which she is learning to move again. She said she has been asked for a fifth time for a medical report to prove her disability was as a result of the scandal.",
      "How do the Post Office compensation schemes work?",
      "'Just pay up,' says Post Office scandal victim",
      "'The Post Office has ruined every happy moment of my life since 2005'",
      "At the committee, lawyers were asked about their experience of the Horizon Shortfall compensation scheme, which is overseen by the Post Office.",
      "This compensation scheme is for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon.",
      "David Enright, whose law firm represents hundreds of Post Office victims, said there is no funding for legal advice at the start, with claimants presented with a \"DIY questionnaire\".",
      "Then, six to nine months later, he said there is a request for more information which often involves 50-150 further questions that can only be answered by the likes of a forensic accountant.",
      "\"The system is designed to wear people down,\" he told MPs.",
      "Another lawyer said some of his sub-postmaster clients were being asked to provide proof of losses in claims that are 20 years old, but cannot to do so because the evidence had been previously seized by the Post Office and not given back.",
      "The GLO scheme is for the 555 former postmasters who won their group lawsuit, but received relatively small payouts after legal costs were paid. The scheme is funded and managed by the government."

    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "summary": "Deputy PM admits former Soviet state was until recently a 'highly corrupt country' - but insists things are changing fast.",
    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",

      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",

      "Among the complaints is that the character is given the ability to read people\u2019s minds and communicate with animals and plants because \"that\u2019s the Indigenous way\", which Sharon Davis from the national First Nations' education body said reduces \"complex and diverse belief systems\" to \"magic\".",
      "The girl is also at the centre of an abduction plot - something community leader Sue-Anne Hunter called a \"particularly insensitive choice\", given the \"painful historical context\" of the Stolen Generations. For decades in Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were removed from their families as part of an assimilation policy from successive governments.",
      "The girl, who is from Mparntwe or Alice Springs, also uses vocabulary from the Gamilaraay people of NSW and Queensland, which Ms Davis said showed \"complete disregard for the vast differences among First Nations languages, cultures, and practices\".",

      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",

      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "story": [
      "The much-anticipated new Paddington in Peru film has had mixed reviews over its opening weekend, with critics calling it \"charming-enough\", but some agreeing the film struggles to reach the heights of its predecessors.",
      "The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy.",
      "The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November.",
      "Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.",
      "Of the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\".",
      "In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\".",
      "Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\".",
      "He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant.",
      "Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears.",
      "\"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\"",
      "Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love.",
      "\"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"",
      "The director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\".",
      "Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\".",
      "She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\"",
      "Away from the big screen, a new Paddington musical is being developed for the stage, with McFly's Tom Fletcher set to write the music and lyrics.",

    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",

      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",

      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",

      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",
      "But two decades later, the fact remains that on meeting Timmy, certainly at first glance, many find him outrageously offensive.",
      "Disability slurs: 'We can't keep being poked like a bear'",
      "Soap star condemns 'daily abuse and prejudice'",
      "Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me'",
      "South Park has always worked on multiple levels - offering outrageous forbidden shock value for schoolchildren while delivering crunching adult satire.",
      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",
      "It removed the videos flagged by the BBC for violating this policy. But it didn\u2019t remove the Timmy sound used on several other videos - meaning it can be used again.",
      "TikTok didn\u2019t respond to a specific question about removing offensive audio.",
      "Ciaran O\u2019Connor, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank focusing on online hate, says that sounds are a \u201cblind spot in TikTok\u2019s content moderation practices\u201d.",
      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",
      "Ross Hovey, a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan, recently posted on LinkedIn about a near-identical experience.",
      "He was heading to a Liverpool match with his 79-year-old father and care assistant when a group of young men shouted \"Timmy\" at him. When Ross challenged them with \u201cI heard you,\u201d they too tried to claim innocence.",
      "The abuse raises questions about what role platforms should take in providing context to young users.",
      "\u201cBrief, contextless clips and participatory trends are at the heart of TikTok\u2019s popularity,\u201d  says O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",
      "\u201cIt's hard not to go overboard with admiration for a nonagenarian who remains so unaffected by her fame on the one hand,\u201d wrote one, \u201cand some of the awful things life has thrown at her on the other.\u201d",
      "She held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart as queen of its longest-running radio drama, and was thought of with enormous affection by her fellow cast members.",
      "June \u201cshone through sadness without a word of complaint,\" recalled Charles Collingwood - who plays Brian Aldridge, her fictional son-in-law, \u201cand always remained immense fun\"."

      "Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years.",

      "\"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.",

      "\"It's not easy, and especially when I do have a daughter that depends on me.\"",
      "Milena says her daughter, who was just one year old when The Receipts started and is now almost 10, helped her find the courage to quit.",

      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",

    "summary": "Hospitality bosses are calling for changes to what they describe as \"unsustainable\" tax rises.",
    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",

      "In 2019, ahead of Trump's state visit to the UK, Lammy also posted that the then-president was \"deluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic\" and \"no friend of Britain\".",
      "Pressed over whether he had changed his mind, Lammy said the remarks were \"old news\" and you would \"struggle to find any politician\" who had not said some \"pretty ripe things\" about Trump in the past.",
      "\"In that period, particularly with people on Twitter, lots of things were said about Donald Trump,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that what you say as a backbencher and what you do wearing the real duty of public office are two different things.",
      "\"And I am foreign secretary. There are things I know now that I didn't know back then.\"",
      "Asked in if Trump brought up his previous comments when the pair met for dinner in New York in September, Lammy said: \"Not even vaguely.\"",
      "\"I know this is a talking point today, but in a world where there's war in Europe, where there's a tremendous loss of life in the Middle East, where the US and the UK genuinely have a special relationship, where we got someone who's about to become again, the US president, who has experience of doing the job last time round, we will forge common interests,\" he said.",
      "\"We will agree and align on much and where we disagree, we'll have those conversations as well, most often in private.\"",

      "He described Trump as \u201cwarm about the UK,\u201d especially toward the Royal Family, and noted he \u201cloves Scotland\u201d.",
      "But during the election campaign, he vowed to dramatically increase taxes, or tariffs, on foreign goods imported into the US.",
      "Such a move could hit billions of pounds' worth of British exports, including Scotch whisky, pharmaceutical products, and airplane parts.",
      "Asked if the UK would seek a special trade arrangement so there were no extra tariffs on British exports to the US, Lammy said: \"We will seek to ensure and to get across to the United States, and I believe that they would understand this, that hurting your closest allies cannot be in your medium or long-term interests.\"",
      "Lammy also said Trump was \"correct\" in his argument that Europe had fallen short on defence spending.",
      "He called for a \u201cclear\u201d pledge from European governments to boosting military spending but could not say when the government would reach its target of spending 2.5% GDP on defence.",
      "Lammy argued another state visit for Trump next year would be a \"tall order\" as they \"take a while to organise\".",
      "State visits are the highest level of diplomatic visit to the UK and traditionally involve a state banquet hosted by the monarch and a carriage parade along the Mall.",
      "But Lammy said the government \"generally want to be generous with our American friends\".",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage, who spent US election night in Florida as Trump\u2019s guest, said it would have been \"impossible\" for Lammy to \"carry on\" as foreign secretary if he had stuck by his previous comments.",
      "But he warned that the \u201cproblems\u201d in Lammy\u2019s relationship with Trump would come from other issues, such as \u201cgiving away the Chagos Islands, where there's a very important US naval base\u201d.",

      "Some surveys suggest the leader himself might not be as popular in Wales as he might like, but Reform is polling at around 14-17 seats .",
      "That would represent a big block in the new expanded 96-seat Senedd.",

      "In a previous mandate, McMonagle was employed jointly by former Sinn F\u00e9in MLAs Daithi McKay and Mitchel McLaughlin in a full-time position from 6 May 2014 to 31 October 2014.",
      "He also worked as press officer for the party in the north west and at Westminster.",

      "The government said the region was a key route used by those who end up in the European Union or UK illegally, with almost 100,000 migrants transiting through the western Balkans last year.",

      "We must stop smuggling gangs before they act - Starmer",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "More than 31,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year - more than the same period last year.",

      "Sir Keir said: \"There is a criminal empire operating on our continent, exacting a horrendous human toll and undermining our national security.\"",
      "He said the UK would be \"at the heart of the efforts to end the scourge of organised immigration crime\" but \"we cannot do it in isolation\".",
      "He added: \"We need to go further and faster, alongside our international partners, and take the fight directly to the heart of these vile people smuggling networks.\"",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Working more closely with Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo, we will share information and intelligence, and work across borders to map out what is happening and where, to break the business models of these unscrupulous gangs at source.\"",

      "On tackling people-smuggling gangs, Mr Biggar said that what is \"particularly hard\" for the NCA \"is that the people themselves are not illegal, their presence in the UK or in some countries on the way here may be illegal, and often the tools that they are using to get here are not themselves illegal - boats and engines\".",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

      "And earlier on the Today programme, former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Labour of making an effective \u201ccut in our defence budget\u201d by including \u00a33bn of Ukraine funding in it.",
      "If Labour reach the 2.5% target, he said he\u2019d welcome it, \u201cbut it\u2019s got to be real money with a timetable\u201d.",
      "There is little disagreement that more resources are needed.",
      "John Healey himself has acknowledged the military \u201chave not been ready to fight\u201d. A squeeze on funding over many years had made money tight \u2013 the forces \u201chollowed out\u201d, according to Wallace.",

      "Another former minister told me that funding \u201cis absolutely urgent \u2013 it is urgent to help Ukraine but the most urgent is where our forces are in danger \u2013 it\u2019s not hypothetical, in the Red Sea the Houthis are firing at our ships.\u201d",
      "And shortly before the election, the government\u2019s new national security adviser Jonathan Powell wrote that a new administration would need to reinforce the UK\u2019s defence and security \u201cwithin the bounds allowed by a struggling economy\u201d.",

      "Another former minister told me, \u201cby any measure we are underspending \u2013 if you don\u2019t buy the insurance policy you end up having to pay yourself and the cost of real conflicts would be immense in comparison\u201d.",
      "A defence source told me, \u201cwe are going to have to make a move on spending or we can put our fingers in our ears and hope we get through it \u2013 the Treasury has to do the maths on this \u2013 the way to stop spending 5 percent of GDP in the future is to spend now.\u201d",

      "Twenty-three now meet the 2% target, up from just six countries in 2021.",
      "Rather than worrying about what Trump might do in office, they said, \u201ca precondition for Trump to take European defence seriously is for Europe to take its own defence seriously.\u201d",

    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",
      "\"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",

      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

    "summary": "It is also set to be the world's first breach of 1.5C of warming across an entire calendar year.",
    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "Donald Trump's return to the White House will have a hugely negative effect on climate change action in the short-term but the longer term impact is less certain, experts say.",
      "With world leaders meeting next week for the latest UN climate talks, COP29, the Trump victory will be seen as a huge roadblock to progress in both cutting emissions and raising cash for developing countries.",
      "The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a \"scam\".",
      "But with renewable energy gaining a strong foothold in the US and popular support for wind and solar, Trump's efforts to ramp up oil and gas instead may be less effective.",

      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

      "This was ratified by the US Senate, almost unanimously, in 1992. Legal experts are unclear on the process of leaving the treaty, but any effort by the US to leave would be seen as a body blow to the principle of multi-lateral action to tackle the world's greatest threat.",
      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",
      "\"You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy,\" Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News.",
      "\"You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers.\"",
      "There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.",
      "But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for  coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.",
      "For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.",
      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",
      "According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.",
      "With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.",
      "Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration.",
      "\"The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action,\" said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

      "The regulator says a merger between Vodafone and Three could go ahead - if both companies make price promises for consumers and commit to boosting the UK's 5G rollout.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously said that creating what would be the country's biggest mobile network could drive up prices and harm competition.",
      "But it has now provisionally concluded those concerns could be addressed - and the merger could proceed - if the firms agree to its proposed remedies.",
      "A Vodafone spokesperson said both companies would need to study the CMA's proposal more closely but believed on first impressions it \"provides a path to final clearance\".",
      "They insisted, as they have throughout, that the deal was in everyone's interests.",

      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

      "Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas's political office in Doha \"no longer serves its purpose\" were \"inaccurate\".",
      "\"Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,\" a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.",

      "Hamas has had a base in the Qatari capital since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.",
      "Several news agencies reported on Saturday that Qatar had agreed with the US to tell Hamas to close its political office in Doha due to \"a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith\".",

      "The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia.",
      "Alongside the US and Egypt, the Qataris have also played a major role in rounds of so-far unsuccessful talks to broker a ceasefire in the year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",
      "But there is growing evidence of a shift in the relationship.",
      "After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas held a two-hour mourning tent in Doha in a small hall, a stark contrast to the recent three-day mourning held for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which was conducted with official state oversight and security.",
      "The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. The group has always called for a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "The Qatari foreign ministry statement said: \"Media reports regarding the Hamas office in Doha is inaccurate.\"",
      "\"The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication... [which] has contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages.\"",
      "Israel has also been accused of rejecting deals. Days after being fired earlier this week, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rejecting a peace deal against the advice of his security chiefs.",
      "The call for Hamas to be expelled from Qatar appears to be an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to force some sort of peace deal before the end of his term in January.",
      "Were Hamas to be forced to leave Doha, it is unclear where they would base their political office. Key ally Iran would be an option, although the assassination of former leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July suggests they may be at risk from Israel if based there. It would also not give them anything close to the same diplomatic channels to the West.",
      "A more likely option would be Turkey. As a Nato member but also a Sunni majority state, it would give the group a base from which to operate in relative safety. Last April President Erdogan hosted then Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and his delegation in Istanbul, where they talked about \u201cwhat needs to be done to ensure adequate and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and a fair and lasting peace process in the region\".",
      "The move would also most likely be welcomed by Ankara, which has often sought to position itself as a broker between east and west.",
      "Key Hamas figures such as Osama Hamdan, Taher al-Nunu, and others frequently featured on news outlets have been staying in Istanbul for over a month.",
      "Their extended presence in Turkey marks a departure from past visits, which were typically limited to brief stays.",
      "It is thought the personal safety of Hamas leadership is now a major concern for the group, which saw two leaders killed in less than four months. As well as Haniyeh\u2019s death in July, in October Israel killed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel.",

      "The latest move comes as US officials appear increasingly frustrated with the approach the Israeli government has taken to ending the war.

      "At first, you cannot see it but you can smell it. It smells like something is burning. And it intensifies as the temperature drops.",

      "If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air.",
      "Your throat might start to feel itchy and sore. As it gets worse, you start sneezing and coughing. But it's worse for others: children, the elderly, those with breathing difficulties. The hospitals know to expect the influx.",

      "Pakistani officials have scrambled to respond to the crisis - its scale unprecedented even in a city which deals with smog at this time each year.",
      "Schools are closed, workers have been told to stay home and people urged to stay indoors - part of a so-called \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d, which has also seen motorbike rickshaws, heavy vehicles and motorbike parking banned from hot spot areas.",
      "By the end of the week, Lahore High Court had ordered all the markets in the Punjab province to close by 20:00 each night, with complete closures on Sundays. Parks and zoos have also been shut until 17 November.",
      "The problem, according to Nasa scientist Pawan Gupta, is that pollution levels in the city \u201ctypically peak in late November and December\u201d.",

      "The same image, six weeks earlier, shows clear skies and - crucially - far fewer fires.",
      "A major cause of the smog is the fires which are caused by the burning of stubble after harvest by farmers in both Pakistan and India -  a quick way to clear their fields ready for the next crops.",
      "This year, Nasa estimates it will count \u201cbetween 15,500 and 18,500 fires \u201d, according to Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Morgan State University, higher than most years.",
      "According to Pakistan\u2019s environment protection authorities, around 30% of Lahore\u2019s smog comes from across the border in India. The Indian government has this year doubled fines for farmers caught stubble-burning as it tries to deal with the issue.",
      "But much of Lahore\u2019s air pollution comes from its five million motorbikes and millions of other vehicles\u2019 exhausts. On Friday, Lahore's high court identified heavy traffic emissions as the main cause of the smog, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.",
      "Then there are the industries in the city\u2019s outskirts - like the coal-fired brick kilns - adding even more pollution to the air.",

      "The 20,000 cap is likely to only lead to tourists being turned away on a handful of occasions. A spokesperson for the park told Reuters that it had only exceeded 20,000 visitors when entry is free on the first Sunday of the month, as well as three or four fee-paying days.",

      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",

      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would \"not rule out\" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from \"the liberal groups or the progressive groups\".",
      "He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not \"won't partake in the riches\".",
      "\"We have to do this,\" he said. \"This is not a sustainable problem for our country.\"",
      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 04:21:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Building the link to western Europe has become more urgent as the Baltics see Russia as a threat.",
    "story": [
      "The three Baltic states came up with the idea years ago for a high-speed railway spanning 870km (540 miles) across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.",
      "Rail Baltica began as a grand project, but it has now become a strategic imperative: since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics increasingly view their neighbour as an existential threat.",
      "Currently, there is no direct link that crosses the Baltics and connects with Poland.",
      "Rail Baltica will do that, cutting travel time and bringing economic and environmental benefits, but the costs of this ambitious scheme are mounting.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltic states and their Nato allies need the railway in place fast.",
      "Estonia's Infrastructure Minister Vladimir Svet said the rail link is vital amid the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin's aggressive regime is trying to recreate an imperial project on the territory of the former Soviet bloc.\"",
      "The memory of decades of Soviet occupation is still fresh in the Baltics. Moscow deported hundreds of thousands of people from the region to Siberia.",
      "Estonia and Latvia share land borders with Russia, while Lithuania is adjacent to the Russian enclave Kaliningrad, which also shares a border with Poland, and Moscow's close ally, Belarus.",
      "About 10,000 Nato soldiers are currently stationed in the Baltics, alongside local troops. Their total number could reach 200,000 in a worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cRail Baltica will increase military mobility and allow trains to go directly from the Netherlands to Tallinn,\u201d Cmdr Peter Nielsen, from Nato's Force Integration Unit, said.",
      "For Estonia's infrastructure minister, the railway is \u201can unbreakable link with the networks of Europe\u201d.",
      "Not far from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, at the tip of the railway, dozens of workers are welding and hammering away at the new \u00dclemiste passenger terminal.",
      "\u201cThis will be the network's most northern point, the starting point of 215km of railway in Estonia and 870km across the three Baltic States,\u201d said Anvar Salomets, CEO of Rail Baltica Estonia, stepping carefully across the embryonic platforms.",
      "Until now, the Baltics have used a Russian track width because their rail system dates back to the Soviet era.",
      "Passengers have to change trains to the European system when they get to the Polish border.",
      "The new network will use the European railway track width and connect seamlessly with railways across the EU.",
      "LISTEN: Building a geopolitical railway",
      "Baltic concerns over plans to move Russia's sea borders",
      "\u201cThe trains will run at up to 250km/h (155mph) compared with 80 or 120km/h (50 or 74mph) right now,\u201d Salomets added.",
      "That means journey times from Tallinn to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, will be massively reduced, from at least 12 hours now to under four.",
      "\u201cIt'll be a game-changer, decreasing the environmental impact across our whole transport sector,\u201d says Salomets, who foresees big economic benefits.",
      "Recent analysis for the Rail Baltica consortium estimates the overall economic boost at \u20ac6.6bn (\u00a35.5bn).",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of studies of existing high speed rail systems show a positive economic impact,\u201d said Adam Cohen of the University of California at Berkeley.",
      "But those benefits will not appear overnight and there is growing concern at the spiralling cost. Developers' estimates have increased fourfold since 2017 and now stand at \u20ac24bn.",
      "So far, the EU has subsidised 85% of the project and has just announced another \u20ac1.1bn.",
      "Estonia and Latvia have also come under criticism for focusing on putting up the rail terminals first before they build the mainline.",
      "French engineer Emilien Dang, whose RB Rail oversees the project, blamed recent global crises for the big spike in costs: \u201cOur initial estimate hadn't taken into account the Covid pandemic and high inflation - and the situation in Ukraine has dramatically increased the cost of material.\u201d",
      "As he walked across a big new terminal in the Latvian capital Riga, he also cited cultural issues.",
      "\u201cThe view from France, wrongly, is that the Baltics are one unit.  But they are three countries, with different regulations.\u201d",
      "The Baltic states have decided to split the project into two phases. The first, costing \u20ac15bn, will have a single instead of double track laid by 2030 and focus on the most important train stops.",
      "The second track and additional train stations are to be completed as part of a second phase with no specific completion date yet.",
      "The soaring costs have prompted the states to scale back some of their ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe can further scale back the scope of phase one, for example by connecting Riga airport at a later stage,\u201d said Andris Kulbergs, who chairs a Latvian parliamentary committee investigating the project.",
      "As billions of euros for the first phase are yet to be secured, that might be necessary.",
      "Estonia's national auditor Janar Holm believes several more years of delays are likely: \u201cWe have to find the funds to build this railway now or it'll be even more expensive.\u201d",
      "The country's infrastructure minister, Vladimir Svet, insisted \"we are decreasing the budget as much as possible, we\u2019ve rationalised the public procurement process and, if necessary, we'll take on a loan.\"",

    "story": [
      "What the rest of the world sees as a sex tape scandal could in fact be the latest episode in the real-life drama over who will become Equatorial Guinea\u2019s next president.",
      "Over the past fortnight, dozens of videos - estimates range from 150 to more than 400 - have been leaked of a senior civil servant having sex in his office and elsewhere with different women.",
      "They have flooded social media, shocking and titillating people in the small central African country and beyond.",
      "Many of the women filmed were wives and relatives of people close to the centre of power.",
      "It appears some were aware they were being filmed having sex with Baltasar Ebang Mr Engonga, who is also known as \u201cBello\u201d because of his good looks.",
      "All this is hard to verify as Equatorial Guinea is a highly restricted society where a free press does not exist.",
      "But one theory is that the leaks were a way to discredit the man at the centre of the storm.",
      "Mr Engonga is a nephew of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and one of those thought to be hoping to replace him.",
      "Obiang is the world\u2019s longest-serving president having been in power since 1979.",
      "The 82-year-old has overseen an economic boom that has turned to bust as a result of the now-dwindling oil reserves.",
      "There is a small, extremely wealthy elite, but many of the 1.7 million people in the country live in poverty.",
      "Obiang\u2019s administration is heavily criticised for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture, according to a US government report.",
      "It has also had its fair share of scandals - including the revelations about the lavish lifestyle of one of the president's sons, now vice-president, who once owned a $275,000 (\u00a3210,000) crystal-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson.",
      "Despite regular elections, there is no real opposition in Equatorial Guinea as activists have been jailed and exiled and those with designs on office are closely monitored.",
      "Politics in the country is really about palace intrigue and this is where the scandal involving Mr Engonga fits in.",
      "He was the head of the National Financial Investigation Agency, and worked on tackling crimes such as money laundering.",
      "But it turned out he himself was under investigation.",
      "He was arrested on 25 October accused of embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the Cayman Islands. He has not commented on the accusation.",
      "Mr Engonga was then taken to the infamous Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo, where it is alleged that opponents of the government are subjected to brutal treatment.",
      "His phones and computers were seized and a few days later the intimate videos started appearing online.",
      "The first reference the BBC has found to them on Facebook is from 28 October on the page of Diario Rombe, a news site run by a journalist in exile in Spain, which said that \u201csocial networks exploded with the leaking of explicit images and videos\u201d.",
      "A post on X the following day referred to a \u201cmonumental scandal shaking the regime\u201d as \u201cpornographic videos flood social media\u201d.",
      "But they are believed to have originally appeared one-by-one a few days earlier on Telegram, on one of the platform's channels known for publishing pornographic images.",
      "They were then downloaded on to people\u2019s phones and shared among WhatsApp groups in Equatorial Guinea, where they caused a storm.",
      "Mr Engonga was quickly identified along with some of the women in the videos, including relatives of the president and wives to ministers and senior military officials.",
      "The government was unable to ignore what was going on and on 30 October Vice-President Teodoro Obiang Mangue (once owner of the Michael Jackson glove) gave telecoms companies 24 hours to come up with ways to stop the spread of the clips.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to watch families fall apart without taking any action,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, the origin of these publications is being investigated to find the author or authors and make them answer for their actions.\u201d",
      "As the computer equipment was in the hands of the security forces, suspicion has fallen on someone there, who, perhaps, sought to trash Mr Engonga\u2019s reputation ahead of a trial.",
      "The police have called on women to come forward to open a case against Mr Engonga for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. One has already announced that she is suing him.",
      "What is not clear is why Mr Engonga made the recordings.",
      "But activists have put forward what could be other motives behind the explosive leak.",
      "As well as being related to the president, Mr Engonga is the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo'o, the head of the regional economic and monetary union, Cemac, and very influential in the country.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is the end of an era, the end of the current president, and there is a succession [question] and this is the internal fighting we are seeing,\u201d said Equatoguinean activist Nsang Christia Esimi Cruz, now living in London.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Focus on Africa podcast, he alleged that Vice-President Obiang was trying to politically eliminate \u201canyone who could challenge his succession\u201d.",
      "The vice-president, along with his mother, are suspected to be pushing aside anyone who threatens his path to the presidency, including Gabriel Obiang Lima (another son of President Obiang from a different wife), who was oil minister for 10 years and then moved to a secondary government role.",
      "Those in the elite are thought to know things about each other that they would rather was not made public, and videos have been used in the past to humiliate and discredit a political opponent.",
      "There are also frequent accusations of coup plotting, which further fuels paranoia.",
      "But Mr Cruz also alleges that the authorities want to use the scandal as an excuse to crack down on social media, which is how a lot of information about what is really going on in the country gets out.",
      "In July, the authorities temporarily suspended the internet after protests broke out on the island of Annob\u00f3n.",
      "For him, the fact that a high-ranking official was having sex outside of marriage was not surprising as it was part of the decadent lifestyle of the country\u2019s elite.",
      "The vice-president, who himself has been convicted of corruption in France and has had lavish assets seized in various countries, wants to be seen as the man cracking down on graft and wrong-doing at home.",
      "Last year, for example, he ordered the arrest of his half-brother over allegations he sold a plane owned by the state airline.",
      "But in this case, despite the vice-president\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of the clips, they continue to be viewed.",
      "This week, he tried to appear more resolute calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in government offices \u201cto combat indecent and illicit acts\u201d, the official news agency reported.",
      "Saying that the scandal had \u201cdenigrated the image of the country\u201d he ordered that any officials found engaging in sex acts at work would be suspended as this was a \"flagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

      "T Bone Burnett is best known as a music producer, but in April, he released \"The Other Side,\" his first album of new music in 18 years. Asked why he releases his own music so infrequently, Burnett replied, \"I've always been a behind-the-scenes person. I like creating in private.\"",

      "He was quoted earlier this year saying he always viewed the audience as a mob coming to get him. \"Yeah, like a lynch mob or something,\" he laughed. \"It was just raw paranoia, but also just insecurity.\"",
      "Burnett is more at home in the studio, where he's produced albums for The Wallflowers, Greg Allman, and Elton John.",
      "Asked what he thinks he can get out of musicians that maybe other people don't, Burnett said, \"Well, what I try to get out of them is just their full love, their full being.\"",

In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",

      "Reilly's portrayal of Beth \u2014 the only daughter of patriarch\u00a0John Dutton, played by\u00a0Kevin Costner\u00a0\u2014has become iconic for her fierce loyalty, deep love and unpredictable nature. In season five, Beth is locked in a bitter conflict with her brother Jamie, whose manipulative schemes threaten to tear their family apart. Reilly said Beth's intensity comes from a painful past.",

      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",

      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases.

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",

      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",
      "\"PE should remain an available option for consumers, because Americans deserve the option to choose the safe and effective OTC medicines they prefer and rely on,\" Scott Melville, CHPA's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "After the FDA's advisory committee last year, pharmacy chain\u00a0CVS said it would pull\u00a0any products on its shelves that only contained the product.",
      "Spokespeople for drugmakers behind the brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump reiterated he doesn't intend to sell his stock in Trump Media, and called for an investigation into short sellers.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to reiterate that he doesn't plan to sell shares of Trump Media & Technology Group. He also called for an investigation from \"the appropriate authorities\" into \"market manipulators or short sellers,\" whom executives at the company and shareholders have previously blamed for volatility in the stock, which trades under the ticker symbol DJT.",
      "DJT shares jumped shortly after Trump's post, gaining as much as 16% on Friday. The stock rose $3.15, or 11.4%, to $30.84 in early afternoon trading, partly reversing a 23% plunge on Thursday that had trimmed some of the company's gains in the run-up to the November 5 election.",
      "Trump, who is the biggest shareholder of Trump Media with a 57% stake, said the business has been the target of \"probably illegal rumors and/or statements\" that he said allege he plans to sell shares of the company, which owns the Truth Social platform. In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",
      "Trump Media, whose DJT ticker is the same as Trump's initials, has seen extreme volatility on Nasdaq, with its shares swinging wildly on news related to the president-elect. That has prompted comparisons of DJT with meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than financial fundamentals such as revenue and profit growth.",
      "Trump's call for an investigation into trading of the stock highlight potential conflicts of interest between his role as the nation's chief executive and his business interests, with his holdings in the company valued at $3.6 billion as of Friday afternoon. As president, Trump will not only have oversight of many federal agencies, but will also appoint the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that regulates the securities industry.",
      "Although there's no requirement that presidents sell their financial assets when they take office, most U.S. presidents have opted to put their business holdings into a blind trust,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he chose not to place his company, the Trump Organization, into a blind trust, opting instead to\u00a0hand over management\u00a0of the company to his oldest two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, along with its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg was\u00a0released from jail\u00a0in July after pleading guilty to giving false testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment as part of a civil fraud trial.)",
      "Trump's arrangement during his first administration was flagged by some ethics experts as problematic, with former chief White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen\u00a0writing\u00a0in 2017 that it failed to resolve the conflicts of interest between Trump's business holdings and his role as president.",
      "Trump Media stock price chart",
      "Trump Media has attracted short sellers, or investors who seek to make a profit when a stock tumbles. That drew\u00a0accusations\u00a0from Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, that these investors have manipulated the stock. Nunes has requested investigations by lawmakers and the Nasdaq stock market, where DJT is listed.",
      "Because of Trump's majority ownership of DJT stock, the stock would likely drop if he sold his shares \"for any reason,\" noted S3 Partners in a November 6 research note.",
      "In his post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said he believes in Trump Media, and refuted claims that he is interested in selling shares.",
      "\"THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING!\" Trump wrote. \"I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities.\"",

      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",
      "If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it on the\u00a0FTC's website.",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:41:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 17:54:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",

      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy - and your money",
      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

      "\"I think what needs to happen is happening, but it'll be some time before people regain their confidence,\" he added. \"We don't tell people how to feel about the economy \u2014 we completely respect what they are feeling.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed\u00a0announced its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7. That was followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",
      "The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.",
      "How will the election impact the Fed's decision?",
      "The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former\u00a0President Donald Trump to victory.",
      "Although Fed chief Powell was asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, he shied away from commenting about the election. He also added that the election won't have a near-term impact on the Fed's decisions, with the central bank instead relying on economic data.",
      "\"We don't know what the timing or substance of any policy changes will be,\" Powell said. \"We don't guess, we don't speculate and we don't assume.\"",
      "Powell has long stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics.",
      "Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate.",
      "If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",
      "What the Fed rate cut means for mortgage interest rates",
      "What the Fed rate cut means for mortgage interest rates",
      "\"As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.",

      "Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group had an eventful Election Day 2024, with its DJT stock halted three times after the shares suddenly plunged. At the end of the trading day, the Truth Social owner released its third-quarter earnings, showing a continued decline in revenue.",
      "The company's third-quarter results, disclosed in a U.S. Securities & Exchange filing, shows that the fledgling social media business continues to lose money, while its revenue slipped 5.6% compared with a year earlier. Still, that marks an improvement from the prior quarter, when Trump Media's sales tumbled 30%.",
      "Donald Trump's stake in DJT",
      "DJT stock has been on a rollercoaster since going public in March, with the shares surging or falling in line with news about Trump, its largest shareholder, with about 57% of the company's shares. The erratic fluctuations of the shares have prompted comparisons with so-called meme stocks, which trade on social media buzz rather than the fundamentals that investors prefer, such as revenue and profitability growth.",
      "\"This has been an extraordinary quarter for the company, for Truth Social users, and for our legion of retail investors who support our mission to serve as a beachhead for free speech on the internet,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement.",

      "How DJT stock performed on Election Day",
      "DJT stock initially surged almost 19% on Election Day before giving up those gains and closing down 1%. Trading in the stock was also halted three times on Tuesday by the New York Stock Exchange due to sudden drops in its price.",
      "The shares have been on a wild ride since going public in March, initially surging and giving former president's 57% stake a value of\u00a0$5.2 billion. But the shares tumbled after Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, eventually hitting a low of $11.75 per share in September and shaving Trump's stake to $1.4 billion.",
      "But after hitting that low, the shares more than quadrupled after Trump was predicted to win the presidential race by betting markets like Polymarket.",
      "Yet in recent days, DJT stock has lost much of those gains, shedding 34% of its value since its most recent high of $51.51 per share on October 29.",

    "summary": "One market strategist notes a pattern based on whether the S&amp;P 500 rises or falls between the end of July and Halloween.",
    "story": [
      "If history is any guide, one stock market gauge suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "In all but two elections since 1944, the party in the White House has retained power when the U.S. stock market advances before Election Day, or the period between the end of July and Halloween, according to an election predictor devised by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",
      "\"Is this really statistically significant? I think the answer is no, but it makes for interesting copy,\" the strategist said. \"You can have data tell whatever story you want.\"",
      "Limited or not, Stovall is sticking with his presidential predictor.",

In extremely close races, a recount may be required, potentially extending the process.",

      "But Simon and some of her new colleagues do not intend to go unnoticed \u2014 no matter which party controls the Congress or the White House.",
      "With her vision impaired, Simon has relied on public transportation and has a history of advocating to make mass transit more accessible to low-income people. She is embracing the opportunity to succeed Rep. Barbara Lee, a longtime progressive fixture in Washington who left office to pursue an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic party's nomination for U.S. Senate in California in 2024.",
      "Speaking to CBS News by phone while preparing for her first trip to Washington as an elected congresswoman, Simon said she first must rebound from Harris's defeat in the Presidential race. \"I'm devastated. My mentor was the President we deserved. But Kamala would always say: 'Head up, roll up your sleeves, get to work.' So that's what I intend to do.\"",
      "Simon said she'll pursue roles with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, considering her background championing issues of mass transportation, and will seek out early leadership roles.",
      "Simon told CBS News it is important that there is diversity among the members of key panels. \"We must defend the values of not just our party, but the people of the United States, particularly me, as disabled people,\" she said. \"Also the elders, the folks who are seeking health care, queer kids. I have work to do.\"",
      "Simon and the dozens of others who were newly-elected to Congress on Tuesday face a more immediate hurdle:\u00a0 A tidal wave of life changes.",
      "For Simon, that includes moving her daughter to a new community midyear.",
      "\"As long as my seat is on the floor... I won't complain\"",
      "For Tom Barrett, a military veteran who won a competitive race for a vacated seat in the Michigan 7th Congressional District, it has been impossible to simply open all of the text messages.",
      "Barrett told CBS News, \"I can't even tell you how many phone calls I've received in the last couple of days. I probably received 1,000 text messages just on election night. I haven't read them all.\"",
      "Barrett, a Michigan state senator from the Lansing area, bested a Democratic challenger in one of the most heated and expensive House races in the Midwest. Barrett said he is hesitant to make any demands of his new colleagues.",
      "\"I joked to House Speaker Mike Johnson that as long as my seat is on the floor \u2014 and not in the upper Gallery \u2014 I won't complain,\" Barrett said.",
      "\"I recognize that it is a significant job that has a lot of responsibility,\" Barrett said.",
      "But he appears poised to work comfortably in a Trump-dominated Washington. When asked for his top legislative and leadership priorities, Barrett uncorked a response that name-checked Trump six times.",
      "Barrett spoke of \"extending a lot of the provisions of the Trump tax cuts,\" \"Helping the Trump Administration stem the flow of people over the border\" and restoring prior \"Trump policies.\"",
      "Barrett served as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army in the Iraq War and said he'd be interested in a seat on the\u00a0 House Committee on Armed Services. But in the meantime, the Eaton County, Michigan, resident must find a different flight plan. He is spending time seeking the best weekly plan to trek by air to Washington, D.C. from either Lansing, Grand Rapids or Detroit.",

      "After an exhausting campaign in which he and his campaign volunteers touted that they knocked on 200,000 doors, Democrat Josh Riley said he was looking forward to one quiet, post-election night with his 4-year-old son.",
      "\"He's getting an apple juice, I'm getting a beer and we're going to watch a Cornell hockey game,\" Riley said.",
      "Riley won one of the most expensive House races in the nation, defeating first-term Republican Marc Molinaro in an 11-county swath of upstate New York, spanning from Cooperstown to Binghamton and the distant New York City exurbs.",
      "Arriving at a tumultuous moment in Washington, Riley said he will not try to compete with Trump or his powerful colleagues for a spotlight.\u00a0 Riley told CBS News, \"I'm not searching for a way to stand out. If I do this job successfully, people in upstate New York will have more job opportunities and good wages.\"",
      "Riley said he will take office with a high priority issue:\u00a0 Housing prices. \"One of the things I'd like to do,\" Riley said, \"Is stop the predatory practice of Wall Street entities running around upstate New York, gobbling up our single family homes and using them to extract profits. Housing should be looked at as a civil right, not as a driver of profits.\"",

      "Bresnahan edged a veteran House Democrat to secure the seat representing the Scranton area of Pennsylvania. He leads an electrical and construction business, while also working in real estate development.\u00a0 His introduction to politics included an unexpected stress: Bresnahan said his fianc\u00e9e, a local television news anchor, worked as the same broadcast outlet on which his opponent aired attack ads against him.",
      "\"I give her so much credit for being able to, you know, watch the horrible things that were being said about me,\" Breshnahan said.",
      "Bresnahan was one of two Republicans to oust Democratic House incumbents in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Those victories gave Republicans an edge in securing a majority control of the House, which could turbocharge Trump's legislative agenda in 2025.",
      "Bresnahan told CBS News he'd seek a seat on the House's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.",
      "\"I understand the significance of infrastructure and transportation, outside of traditional roads and bridges,\" he said. \"Airports, levies, ports, freight rail and power distribution systems and sewer systems, that is the foundation and the hierarchy of needs of a society. I really think I can make a tangible difference with just my history of what I've done.\"",

      "Mackenzie told CBS News that he and his wife \"are going to be loading up the SUV and going down and trying to find an apartment.\"",

      "After toppling incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in a heated battleground race that captured the attention of both parties, Mackenzie argued that bipartisan efforts hold the most promise of big change.",
      "\"If you want lasting change, you have to do it in a bipartisan fashion,\" he said. \"If you change something and it's unpalatable to the other side, they're just going to come and kick it out next time. And then the pendulum swings back and forth.\"",
      "Mackenzie, 42, is one of dozens of Members of Congress-elect who will represent politically-purple congressional districts, in which the opposing party is likely to muster a well-funded challenger in 2026.",
      "He will begin his new job, with an immediate potential political target on his back. \tMackenzie said his successful challenge to Wild was an expensive and grueling battle.",
      "\"In a close and competitive district, it was never going to be a blowout,\" he said. \"That's not the reality of this district. So we always knew it was going to be close, always competitive.\"",
      "Mackenzie has served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, focusing on financial services and banking issues, and would seek similar committee work next year in the House. The House Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are expected to play outsized roles, as Trump pursues new tax cuts, tariffs and campaign pledges to tackle inflation.",
      "\"National conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that\"",
      "Kristen McDonald Rivet capped her victorious election week with a Friday trek to a cellphone store. Her 15-year-old son needed a cellphone repair, which was joking referred to as a \"national emergency.\"",
      "The mother of six already repaired some of the damage her party suffered Tuesday. McDonald Rivet, a state legislator in Michigan, won a competitive race for Michigan's 8th Congressional District in the Flint area. Trump prevailed in the 8th Congressional District and Democrats worried about their prospects there, because of the retirement of longtime Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, the latest in a family dynasty that's held the seat for decades.",
      "\"Here's the thing: My district voted for Donald Trump,\" McDonald Pivet told CBS News by phone, after returning from the cellphone store repair mission. \"There is a lot of national conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that.\u00a0 When we're working on things like prescription drugs, the cost of housing and lowering the cost of groceries, then I'm on board.I'm not going to get involved in the yelling and screaming and the stuff that makes politics awful.\"",
      "She paused a moment, relating to CBS News that it really is striking just how many groceries a 15-year-old son can consume. (She correctly fact-checked that the CBS News reporter's 14-year-old son was also prodigious at eating high volumes of food)",
      "McDonald Pivet arrives in Washington with years of experience in Michigan's state legislature in Lansing. \u00a0 \"I've spent my life working on issues, like creating economic security for families, particularly for kids. \u00a0 I started my career in Head Start.\u00a0 These issues are top of mind, including expansion of the child tax credit.\"",

      "The group of newly-elected US House members arrives at a generally unstable moment in Washington, but amid a rare spec of stability in the lower chamber.\u00a0Leadership of House Republicans and House Democrats is expected to remain unscathed, after an expensive and heated election in which the margins in the House could emerge unchanged.",
      "Orientation sessions for new members of the House begin this week near Capitol Hill, with some of the newly-elected seeking living quarters and training sessions for their unique new jobs.",
      "Several of those who spoke with CBS News said they have spent their first days as an elected federal official working to find staff and constituent service experts.",
      "Bresnahan, the incoming freshman Representative from northeast Pennsylvania, is among those who must wind down \u2014 or find contingency plans \u2013 for private businesses back home. \"I'm also a real estate developer and am trying to figure out, y'know, who is going to assume my role here,\" he said.",
      "Bresnahan also has a post on the local SPCA board in Pennsylvania to navigate, as he simultaneously tries to learn to navigate the winding hallways and tunnels of Capitol Hill.",
      "As for Simon, who says she is shifting her daughter to a new school in advance of beginning a term in Congress, the juggling of her new career is already well underway. As a single mom, she's bearing an additional burden.",
      "Simon paused a few moments in silence, then told CBS News, \"Here's the deal:\u00a0 It's going to be a tough job. But there are single mothers who are barely making minimum wage. And they are making ends meet barely. I will figure it out.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" after bruising defeats in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" in the wake of the 2024 election, which delivered bruising blows to the party \u2014 and prompted a reckoning on the path forward.",
      "\"We did not have a compelling enough economic vision,\" Khanna, a California Democrat, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week, as the Democrats lost support from key demographic groups from the 2020 election. Khanna, a member of the party's progressive wing, attributed the fracturing among the Democratic coalition to the shortcomings in the party's economic message.",
      "\"The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans,\" Khanna said. \"Not just working-class Americans \u2014 a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.\"",
      "Khanna said new voices in Congress, like Reps. Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Chris Deluzio, have encouraged that Democrats need to tell a \"better economic story,\" emphasizing a vision of raising the minimum wage, addressing child care and building new factories.",
      "\"I think that can unify our party \u2014 moderates and progressives \u2014 and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, White working class voters,\" Khanna said. \"And we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.\"",
      "In the days since the election, some Democrats have expressed that the economic message should have been front and center in the campaign, while arguing that the party had a focus on identity politics. But Khanna said that while he's been clear on the importance of economic issues, \"I don't think we should run away\" from issues like standing up for transgender rights and equal rights.",
      "Khanna urged Democrats not to \"shy away from your convictions,\" adding that with the issues, along with a focus on the economy, the party can still be successful.",
      "\"I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue,\" Khanna said.",
      "In Michigan, Harris lost key support in Arab American areas amid Israel's war in Gaza. Khanna said he believes that Harris would have won Michigan \"if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza.\" He added that he has seen that even \"beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.\"",
      "Amid the hand wringing over the election, Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's late decision to leave the race and endorse Harris, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Khanna said while he has a \"lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi,\" he's \"chuckled\" at the idea.",
      "\"The day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over-the-top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing,\" Khanna said. \"So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.\"",
      "Khanna said Harris' was a \"winnable campaign,\" adding that \"anyone who is saying now 'this was not a winnable campaign' didn't say that back in August.\"",
      "\"The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground\" on emphasizing economic issues, Khanna said. \"The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance.\"",

Republicans will also control the Senate with at least 52 seats, and there are two races that have not yet been called by CBS News.

      "ROBERT COSTA: Great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "In recent days, I have spoken to president-elect Trump, called him up on the phone, along with his top advisers and allies. And what's notable about this transition is that, unlike in 2016, when he was elected as a Washington outsider, now he knows all the players in Washington.",
      "And he alone, more than any other aid, is evaluating the personnel and possibilities around him. And he reflected in one of our conversations about how he sees his mandate, that he has a movement and a base and now a party that's fully behind him. And he wants to make sure that anyone who comes on board has his same vision for that mandate and for his perceived level of support.",
      "And you have seen in recent days people around Trump in the wider orbit are trying to recommend a lot of names, but it's Trump himself who's saying to his top aides like Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff, that he wants to make sure that this is not a chaotic process and it's reflective of where he wants to go, more than any other kind of counsel.",
      "And on foreign policy, for example, you see names like Senator Bill Hagerty, Senator Marco Rubio, former Ambassador Ric Grenell, all people who identify with Trump's vision. But those who have had issues with Trump in the past about how he perceives foreign policy, like, for example, former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary Mike Pompeo, are now out of the process.",
      "And it's not because of any personal trouble with Trump, I'm told. It's because, at the end of the day, Trump wants to make sure things are moving along smoothly on ideological and policy lines come January.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know what it was with Mike Pompeo, who served him quite loyally for four years as CIA director and secretary of state? Was it his support, for example, of Ukraine?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's just a different orbit around Trump right now. The president-elect has people like Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk. He has Steve Bannon on the outside advising him.",
      "These are people who are noninterventionists. These are people who aren't traditional Republican hawks. That's not to say some hawks won't end up in this administration or some Wall Street figures might end up in this administration as well.",
      "I'm told by my sources that the president-elect is not ruling out mainstream Republicans or more centrist Republicans from joining his team. But, at this point, he's moving quickly to make sure his base, his party, and his image is reflected in the personnel picks fully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are his priorities for the 1st 100 days? Or is that too traditional a way of thinking about it?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, they have a real agenda this time. You remember, in 2017, it was somewhat sporadic in how they moved and navigated on health care and taxes.",
      "They are moving quickly already behind the scenes to expand the Trump tax cuts, to institute sweeping tariffs across the board. They're also going to try to, on foreign policy, begin negotiations with Ukraine and Russia sometime early next year. And you have mass deportations, more than anything, galvanizing the Trump people behind the scenes.",
      "Of course, they know it's going to be controversial. To remove undocumented migrants in a big way across the country could be logistically difficult and politically challenging, but they're moving ahead.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Oh, I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And",
      "I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine. I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.",
      "You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I have been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first.",
      "And I have taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No, but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion.",
      "That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. And with the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first.",
      "But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60-a-barrel cap. The argument they make, that reduces Russia's profits.",
      "What it does, actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with an energy cost advantage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out.",
      "Interestingly, interestingly, I will call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the E.U. say, maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's been talked about for some time.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around.",
      "The U.K. has said, we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5 percent, all since President Trump was elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was \u2013 was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine.",
      "So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that \u2013 is that the mandate?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I think President Trump will find \u2013 President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment. You have Chinese equipment.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Deeply concerning, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield.",
      "So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are extensive sanctions on Russia, whether or not they're\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Iran, we had them shut down. Iran was broke. Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. We had a maximum pressure campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign \u2013 President Trump led this.",
      "We were able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did.",

      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No. And, if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is, we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department, the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The U.N. says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine.",
      "If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I have had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law. It's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes. Well, I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70-plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that leads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe \u2013 you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I would like to see what \u2013 I would like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to \u2013 again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters. Certainly, in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that.",
      "Do you think \u2013 and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause, to borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration.",
      "He's going to focus on Iran, because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 except for the fact that they released the enforcement of sanctions\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific.",
      "The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a businessperson negotiates.",
      "Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War, a significant investment on behalf of the American people.",
      "Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Today, they are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss, within the level of support\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible to strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan.",
      "They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP. That's a positive development.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They're trying to work more closely with us. I think, in President Trump's administration, they definitely will.",
      "This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his Cabinet, if asked?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I will just say this.",
      "I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee serving in the United States Senate.",
      "In whatever role I hold going \u2013 going forward, it's going to be advanced - - it's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I will do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.",
      "Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years.",
      "And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues, including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these \u2013 these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now.",
      "We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last 2.5 years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.",
      "And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got, like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that, by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized.",
      "And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",
      "And, ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.",
      "But President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos.",
      "What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 in the most dramatic and full-throated way one could \u2013 could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia.",
      "We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Hagerty was saying it's \u2013 Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting.",
      "They have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine \u2013 for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong-un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure.",
      "And, frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going-forward basis.",
      "But I will tell you this. Kim Jong-un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or 10 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea in both directions is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is coming to the White House. That was just announced.",
      "What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and \u2013 and he'll speak to his decisions.",
      "Here's what I see. First, in Gaza, it really today is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease-fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease-fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Hamas has said no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Mr. \u2013 Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made.",
      "What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is, no, we will not do a cease-fire-and- hostage deal at this time.",
      "So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction.",
      "And then, when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Those should remain behind closed doors.",
      "But we do believe that, at some point, the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel. And I expect that, in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account?",
      "Because the secretaries of state and defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So, basically, what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the president confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as Salt Typhoon?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber- enabled espionage, about cyberattacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, and our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And, of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay tuned across CBS News for all the latest news on president-elect Donald Trump's transition plans and how his new policies will impact Americans. You can watch live or on demand on Paramount+ or on our CBS News app.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with California Congressman Ro Khanna.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that. But, Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical, political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy. The course of this, a political discourse. The idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues is about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections. And I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028. In one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck.",
      "But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020, you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids. And you have new voices, Congress people like Pat Ryan, Mary - Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that can unify our party, moderates and progressives, and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, black voters, white working class voters. And we had a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting, in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening, to hear from so many Democrats now who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up, talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police, and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement, woke politics, really was incredibly damaging to the left? Because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in - on which you are a member.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues. But I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation.",
      "The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing. I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley while towns like Johnstown (ph) were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois, were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Joe Biden - President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us, on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district, since you just mentioned it. Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk significantly. And J.D. Vance, the vice presidential candidate, he really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign.",
      "What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it - is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70 percent of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: But you're right that we had slippage, and probably now 20 percent, 30 percent support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto.",
      "But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley. And we can be the party that helps AI and robotics build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country.",
      "When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans and prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told \"The New York Times\" there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said, there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible.",
      "Do you agree with her?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled with people have said this about President Biden because the day he got out we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.",
      "I think this was a winnable campaign, even when he got out. Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now this was not a winnable campaign didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win ultimately is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground. People like Chris Deluzio, Pat Wright (ph), who were saying, talk about the economy. Talk about people's economic struggles. Have - convince people you have the better policies and better vision.",
      "The reason I'm hopeful for the future is, we have the substance. We actually - you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris. And on this program you defended both many times. One place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims, you heard there was a problem here.",
      "Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. And that wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground.",
      "I also think, beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.",
      "Now, my hope is, because President Trump got some of the votes from the Muslim and Arab community, I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia, they have said that if the president wants a deal with Saudi Arabia that the Palestinian state and a two-state solution has to be front and center, and I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna. Congressman, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari. He joins us now.",
      "Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (Minneapolis Federal Reserve President): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seemed to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here.",
      "Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are - show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. So, right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5 percent or so. So, we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job. But so far so good. I mean I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job. But we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. Are - you're - it sounds like you're expecting another rate cut?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2 percent target. So, if you look at the - what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out, the expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions. And that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible.",
      "But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market, that's going to - that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical. But we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations.",
      "When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation. You said, in some ways it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods.",
      "How long before we would see the economic impact of say a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question, Margaret. I mean I think - if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what \u2013 you know, how they would adjust to that and how - how long it would take and how disruptive it would be.",
      "I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainly about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We, at the Fed, will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the president-elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add $8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, if you look over the long-term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably. So, at some point, those have to be addressed. And that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is, whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2 percent inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that.",
      "But, you're right, over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed. But that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, it - the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5 percent increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one-time tariff. So, if somebody imposed a 1 percent tariff or a 10 percent tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1 percent or 10 percent. That's pretty easy to model and it shouldn't have an effect long-run on inflation.",
      "The challenge becomes if there's a tit for tat and it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses and it's escalating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: That's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain.",
      "So I think, again, with - as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just - right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to business and labor unions all around my region it's one of cautious optimism, that the economy is doing well, there are jobs available. And we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. And so, right now, I would say, we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing. And our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked. He made clear he does not think that the law would require that. And, in fact, it would violate the law.",
      "But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making. And that will continue to do so.",
      "And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So, the governors at the board of governors in Washington serve up to 14-year terms. The presidents of the reserve banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity. Between that and, I think, bipartisan support, that we all want to get inflation back down to 2 percent and we want to keep the economy strong, I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the U.K.'s ambassador to the United States.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ambassador, after this election there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said, \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's prime minister said, \"don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\"",
      "What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience, Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine. I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the U.S., and it certainly emboldens China. And I don't think anyone in the U.S. wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally, he's friends with Vladamir Putin and Donald Trump, he said, \"the situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine.",
      "Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration plans are. But certainly, I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting what's next?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We speak to Donald Trump. The prime minister spoke to him very recently on the Wednesday after, the day after the election.",
      "In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10 percent across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the U.K. may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so, as the U.K. You know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach for many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments is a hugely important part of what we do with America. Something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment in trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda. And we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current U.K. government is a different one, of course, from that period of time, with the Labour Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote, \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\"",
      "Are you concerned that those past statements, and the ideological differences, will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the vice president-elect, have also said critical things about President Trump.",
      "In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues.",
      "You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I won't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological. And I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it. Thank you for watching. Happy birthday, Marines!",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning. Good morning to you. This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that, but Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy, the coarseness of political discourse, the idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections, and I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028 in one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck. But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020 you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids, and you have new voices Congress, people like Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that could unify our party, moderates and progressives. And it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, white working class voters, and we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening to hear from so many Democrats now, who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement \"woke\" politics really was incredibly damaging to the left, because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in, of which you are a member.",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues, but I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation. The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing, I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley, while towns like Johnstown were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Biden -President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district. Since you just mentioned it, Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election, you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk, significantly. And JD Vance, the vice-presidential candidate. He really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign. What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it, is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70% of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yes",
      "REP. KHANNA: But you're right that we had a slippage and probably now 20-30% support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto. But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I've reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley, and we can be the party that helps AI robotics, build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country. When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told The New York Times there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible. Do you agree with her?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled when people have said this about President Biden, because the day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory. I think this was a winnable campaign. Even when he got out, Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now, this was not a winnable campaign, didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground, people like Chris Deluzio, Pat Ryan, who were saying, talk about the economy, talk about people's economic struggles. Have- convince people you have the better policies and better vision. The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance. We actually- you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris, and on this program, you defended both. Many times, one place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said, when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims. You heard there was a problem here. Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. That wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground. I also think beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives. Now my hope is because President Trump got some of the votes for the Muslim and Arab community. I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia. They have said that if the President wants a deal with Saudi Arabia, that the Palestinian state and a two state solution has to be front and center. And I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna, Congressman, thank you very much for your time today. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine, I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation. You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I've been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid. I've been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first. And I've taken a lot of heat over it, from Mitch McConnell from the Wall Street Journal, but this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013there's no U.S. presence in Ukraine",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion. That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here, and with the borders collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first. But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60 a barrel cap. The argument they make that reduces Russia's profits. What it does actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again, unfairly against us, with an energy cost advantage. And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out. Interestingly, interestingly, I'll call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the EU say, \"Maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well that's been talked about for some time--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: We're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around. The UK has said we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5% all since President Trump was elected",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was- was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine. So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I've certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that the mandate?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY:\u00a0 And I think President Trump will find- President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage. Look what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying. They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment, you have Chinese equipment\u2013",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: -- Deeply concerning, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield. So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chess board?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 on Russia whether or not they're--",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Iran we had them shut down. Iran was broke, whether or not they're now they're able to fund terror all over the world, we had a maximum pressure \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China \u2013",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign. President Trump led this. We're able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did the Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror. As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Nothing to the level that we've seen here--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, but on the Middle East.\u00a0 Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No, and if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department- the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The UN says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine. If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Well I've had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law, it's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70 plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe- you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'd like to see what, I'd like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to, again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength. I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters, certainly in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that. Do you think- and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause. To borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration. He's going to focus on Iran because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 but in terms of \u2014",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: \u2014 Except for the fact that they released- the enforcement of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 Upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of US military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific. The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling US troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a business person negotiates. Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War. A significant investment on behalf of the American people. Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries today. They are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant, and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss within the level of support--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible. To strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan, they've agreed to double their defense budget from 1% to 2% of GDP. That's a positive development. They're trying to work more closely with us. I think in President Trump's administration, they definitely will. This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. You are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his cabinet if asked?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'll just say this, I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas. It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee, serving the United States Senate. In whatever role I hold going- going forward, it's going to be advanced. It's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated, that the American people overwhelmingly supported, and I'll do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Federal Reserve president, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President, Neel Kashkari, he joins us now. Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Good morning. Margaret,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seems to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here. Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are- show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1% so right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5% or so, so we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job, but so far so good. I mean, I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job, but we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. It sounds like you're expecting another rate cut.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2% target. So if you look at the what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out. The expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions, and that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible. But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market that's going to that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical but we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations. When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation, you said, in some ways, it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time, you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods. How long before we would see the economic impact of, say, a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question. Margaret, I mean, I think if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what you know, how they would adjust to that, and how, how long it would take, and how disruptive it would be. I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainty about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We at the Fed will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the President Elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add 8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well if you look over the long term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably, so at some point, those have to be addressed, and that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2% inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that, but you're right. Over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed, but that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5% increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by one to two percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one time tariff, so if somebody imposed a 1% tariff or a 10% tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1% or 10%. That's pretty easy to model, and it shouldn't have an effect long run on inflation. The challenge becomes, if there's a tit for tat. And it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses, and it's escalating, that's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain. So I think again, with, as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented, and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to businesses and labor unions all around my region, it's one of cautious optimism that the economy is doing well. There are jobs available, and we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2% and so right now, I would say we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing, and our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked, he made clear he does not think that the law would require that, and in fact, it would violate the law. But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making, and that will continue to do so. And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So the governors at the Board of Governors in Washington serve up to 14 year terms. The presidents of the Reserve Banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity between that and I think, bipartisan support that we all want to get inflation back down to 2% and we want to keep the economy strong. I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and President elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday. There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years. And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues. Including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the President will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these- these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now. We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all-in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground, or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last two and a half years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --And President Biden made clear when President Zelensky was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full. Meaning that by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized. And of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe. And ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, If we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos. What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine in the most dramatic and full throated way one could- could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia. We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty was saying it's- Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting, they have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine- for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong Un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure, and frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going forward basis. But I will tell you this, Kim Jong Un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or ten years ago. So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea, in both directions, is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog is coming to the White House. That was just announced. What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and he'll speak to his decisions. Here's what I see. First in Gaza, it really, today, is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --Hamas has said no",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made. What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is no, we will not do a cease fire and hostage deal at this time. So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table, to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction. And then when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government. Those should remain behind closed doors, but we do believe that at some point the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel, and I expect that in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account? Because the Secretaries of State and Defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: So basically what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says, here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps. This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the President will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the President confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as 'Salt Typhoon?'",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber-enabled espionage, about cyber attacks--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way. And of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the UK's ambassador to the United States. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "AMBASSADOR DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much. Margaret, nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ambassador, after this election, there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's Prime Minister said, \"Don't ask what the US can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\" What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine, I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has- has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all-in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen, and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful, Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the US, and it certainly emboldens China, and I don't think anyone in the US wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on Friday, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally. He's friends with Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, he said \"The situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine. Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration's plans are. But certainly I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting--",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: -- We speak to Donald Trump, the Prime Minister spoke to him very recently, on the Wednesday after- the day after the election. In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons, and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10% across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the UK may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so. As- as the UK, you know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach from many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments are hugely important part of what we do with America, something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment and trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda, and we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current UK Government is a different one, of course, from that period of time with the Labor Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote \"Trump is not only a woman hating neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\" Are you concerned that those past statements and the ideological differences will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the Vice President-Elect, have also said critical things about President Trump. In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the Prime Minister Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues. You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I wouldn't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological, and I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the UK politicians who was at Mar-a-Lago and celebrating on election night was Nigel Farage. He's known for his anti-immigrant stance. There has been, not just in the US, but also in Europe, around the world, this backlash against immigrants and migration, and that has really impacted a lot of politics here. I'm wondering what your thoughts are, more broadly, about what kind of political force and factor that is in the world we're in now? It's a big question, but it does seem like there's something global happening.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I'd agree with you, Margaret, there's something very important for a lot of electorates 'round the world about the subject of immigration. But I don't want to give the impression that in the west or in the UK we are not generous to people in need. We took a lot of Syrians, a lot of Afghans, a lot of Ukrainians. Economic migration is the thing we're all very worried about. And although the problem manifests itself differently in the UK from in the US, I think you're right. It is something that voters care about. It is something that the British Government is committed to tackling. The Prime Minister is very interested in how you act against the criminal gangs who foster this sort of migration, and actually are the ones exploiting people who come across in small boats or whatever conveyance they use. It's about stopping the gangs and stopping the traffickers, and we'll need a lot of international coordination to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Pierce, thank you for your time today.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory is, to say the least, a turning point in the American story.",
      "For Trump and his 74 million supporters, it's a dramatic comeback \u2013 a rebuke of an establishment many of them detest, and an affirmation of his agenda, which includes the mass deportations of undocumented migrants; sweeping tariffs; and deregulating federal agencies, as favored by campaign benefactors like Elon Musk.",
      "But for those who backed Vice President Kamala Harris, it is a crushing loss to a man who attempted to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "In her concession speech, Harris said, \"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results \u2026. At the same time, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "This week, President Joe Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet in the Oval Office.",
      "\"It's a pivotal moment to see Trump return to office,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \"The simplest story we have right now \u2013 which may be the correct one \u2013 is that there was a kind of incumbent backlash against the Biden administration and against the Democratic Party. And Kamala Harris couldn't separate herself from it.\"",
      "Nyhan says Trump's victory is part of a broader trend \u2013 a rejection of incumbents: \"Around the world, the parties that have held power during COVID performed very poorly at the polls. It may just be very difficult to hold power after a bout of inflation. Everyone feels inflation. It's not the same as unemployment, where it's only a subset of folks who are directly affected.",
      "\"What's striking, though, about this situation is that by many, not all, objective measures, the American economy has recovered quite well, in some ways better than many of our counterparts,\" Nyhan said.",
      "Of course, the election was about more than the economy. According to professor Dianne Pinderhughes, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame, race, gender, and class were all factors in this election.",

      "CBS News Trump-Harris poll shows one election, two worlds: How information, beliefs shape tight campaign",
      "She notes Trump's gains among Black and Latino men, but also the challenges faced by female candidates, especially women of color. \"We have a society that is quite ambivalent about women as political candidates, as presidential candidates,\" Pinderhughes said. \"In a discussion with my class yesterday, one of the students said, 'Trump was not beaten by a white woman or a Black woman, but he was by a white man.'\"",
      "After Harris entered the race this summer for a dash to the finish, Democrats were hopeful she could finally break that glass ceiling.",
      "Is that promise of a female president still there? \"I think a lot of people feel that it's not there,\" Pinderhughes said, \"that we have a long way to go, given the contest between two candidates where one is a convicted felon.",
      "\"The fact that people that look at those two candidates and see a credible possibility of Donald Trump being president again was just hard to process,\" she said.",
      "For now, Trump is working to staff his cabinet and inner circle. A top campaign advisor, Susie Wiles, will become the first female White House chief of staff. And, unlike in 2016, when he was an outsider, Trump returns as leader of a party that has remade itself in his image.",
      "Nyhan said, \"He has transformed the Republican Party permanently. And I think the people who hoped that they could just go back to the way things were will finally and fully have to admit defeat.",
      "\"People vote on policy; people vote on party; and they vote on the state of the country,\" Nyhan said. \"In some ways, that's good. But it means we're vulnerable when conditions are unfavorable. And that's brought Donald Trump back from the political dead.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",

    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",

    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",

      "He runs an urban farm in south New Jersey called Urban Farmer Steve, where he grows mushrooms, microgreens, vegetables and flowers.",
      "\"Mushrooms have become my passion, I eat a lot of mushrooms, grow mushrooms for farmer markets and restaurants,\" he said. Farming and being around agriculture \"just gives me life, gives me energy \u2014 and gives me hope.\"",
      "A post shared by Stephen Robinson: Urban Farmer (@urbanfarmersteve)",
      "Veterans like Robinson are steadily flocking to agriculture, a field historically intertwined with the military \u2014 1 in every 6 farms has a producer who is currently serving or who has served in the military. However, in recent years, the number of military farmers has dropped. In 2022, the U.S. had 305,753 producers who had served or were serving in the military, according to a Department of Agriculture census, declining 18% from 2017.",
      "To help stem the decline, provide career opportunities and attract a changing veteran demographic, training programs focused on bringing veterans back to the fields have been launched. Robinson sees himself as part of a new crop of farmers, a city dweller who grew up in Philadelphia and New Jersey and returned from war to an urban environment.",
      "A Black veteran, Robinson envisions helping others in his community learn about the opportunities he says abound in farming even in the city \u2014 and there are resources and opportunities available for people \"who might look different.\"",
      "From the battlefield to urban fields",
      "Robinson couldn't have envisioned his journey when he signed up for the military during his freshman year in college, right after the Sept. 11 attacks.",
      "\"It brought the country together,\" said Robinson.",
      "His father served in the Navy and the Air Force, so it seemed like a natural fit.\u00a0 He was commissioned as an officer in 2003, but before he finished his four-year degree, he was deployed to Iraq in 2005.",
      "\"It was a very hot time when I was there, we were shot at, bombed,\" said Robinson, now 41 years old. \"We were out on the road with IEDs, we were in the thick of things at that time.\"",
      "He left military service in 2010 and, like many other veterans, didn't know what to do next. He had a hard time transitioning from a type of environment where you are \"on edge\" all of the time,\u00a0 \"are trained to be vigilant,\" and \"always ready for an attack or \"for something insane to happen.\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that off or turn that down once you get out of the military,\" he said.",
      "\"I still haven't adjusted to civilian life, to be completely honest,\" Robinson added.\u00a0 \"It's something we are all still working on.\"",
      "A post shared by Stephen Robinson: Urban Farmer (@urbanfarmersteve)",
      "He cycled through a few jobs \u2014 including as a claims representative with the Social Security Administration \u2014 but couldn't find the right fit.",
      "Then he found Veterans to Farmers, a Colorado-based not-for-profit, through online research. Marine Corps veteran Buck Adams launched the organization in 2013 after five years of running his own farm, Circle Fresh Farms, and training veterans in agriculture.",
      "Since its inception and first training programs, veterans have helmed the organization. Navy veteran and executive director Taylor Drew participated in the program in 2017. Now he farms in the mountains of Northwest Colorado with his wife and three kids.",
      "\"It's a good life but a hard living,\" Drew said, adding he's never been more content after stumbling around for a few years after leaving the military.",
      "Drew helps manage the organization and what he says is the overwhelming need to move veterans into farming. He says their tiny organization has trained 220 veterans since 2013 and the network is \"really strong.\"",
      "Supported by a mix of government funds and private donations with a rough budget of $250,000 annually, Drew said the group had 150 applications last year for the 18 slots in their hydroponics (controlled farming) program.",
      "Participant and Navy veteran John Bauman, who is from Chicago, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and now rents two plots of land near Denver, selling his produce at farmers markets. His first crop was carrots, and said farming helps him \"feel better.\"",
      "A new type of farmer",
      "As the number of veterans living in the U.S. declines, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, its demographics are also shifting. Population models show women, Hispanics, Blacks and adults under 50 will make up a large proportion of the veteran population by 2048, according to a 2023 study from Pew Research Center, shifting the needs of veterans interested in farming. The Department of Agriculture's census found Black farmers with military service also increased accounting for 2.5% of producers with military service, compared to 1.2% of all U.S. producers.",
      "\"We must do more to support apprenticeships and train the next generation of farmers,\" Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, wrote in a report on the county's rapidly aging farmers. Americans are more likely to meet a farmer over the age of 65 than under the age of 44, and with a global increase of 2 billion people expected by 2050 - there needs to be enough farmers to grow food. \"The food supply, select manufacturing industries, and even national security hinge on the future of farming,\" said Braun.",
      "Supporting urban farmers could be part of the solution, urban farmers are generally younger than the overall farming population, with an average age of 44, with 32% making a living from farming, according to a National Center for Appropriate Technology report.",
      "A post shared by Stephen Robinson: Urban Farmer (@urbanfarmersteve)",
      "The Veterans Administration offers numerous programs for veterans to learn how to farm, and other not-for-profits provide services, such as Armed to Farm, which offers a program in urban farming in New Orleans and the\u00a0Farmer Veteran Coalition, which offers support for veterans entering the field.",
      "The USDA's Farm Service Agency has provided $862 million in total loans through October 31, the federal agency told CBS News, helping more than 4,000 veterans but many say the demand far outstrips the supply.",
      "\"We're seeing a continued rise in interest across the veteran demographic for building a life and career centered around agriculture \u2013 both in urban and rural settings,\" Jaime Wood, the director for Strategic Initiatives at USDA, which works to support the veteran population, told CBS News. She said USDA has a full-time veteran liason on the team who's previously served in the military.",
      "Urban techniques bring old-fashioned fulfillment",
      "Robinson applied to participate in the Veterans to Farmers program in the fall of 2021 The pandemic gave him the extra push into farming, he said. \"I saw limited food and a lack of produce,\"",
      "He started the 8-10 week program in 2022, flying between New Jersey to Denver for the hydroponic program, which is the technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather than soil.",
      "On Mondays, the veterans enrolled in the program received a crash course in \"Agriculture 101\" and on Tuesdays, they had hands-on work on different farms and visits to learn about farming operations.",
      "Because he lives in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which has cold winters, Robinson thought it was important to learn hydroponic farming, which regulates the growing environment and allows a lot of control over what has been grown and how.",
      "\"It's very consistent, too,\" he said.",
      "Robinson started farming microgreens, which he said doesn't take a lot of up-front investment and can grow within 10-14 days. He soon expanded his microgreen offerings to include lettuce, herbs and mushrooms, which are easier to grow in an urban environment. He sells them to restaurants and at farmers' markets and to consumers.",
      "A post shared by Stephen Robinson: Urban Farmer (@urbanfarmersteve)",
      "Researchers at the National Center for Appropriate Technology found urban farmers can raise crops and livestock and also be structured around \"social aspects related to urban agriculture, which include food security, building communities, and education.\"",
      "Urban agriculture has its limitations, with research showing, half of urban farms surveyed in 2013 had sales of around $10,000 and had to have another form of income to survive. Urban farms often don't have the scale to grow large amounts of food and instead focus on selling niche products to low-volume customers, emphasizing quality and price over quantity, research found.",
      "Robinson said regardless of challenges he's committed to growing his business because it's not just about money, but also personal fulfillment. Learning to farm has completely changed his perspective and life over the past two years and he doesn't struggle as he used to.",
      "\"When you are connected to the earth, you are grounded to the earth,\" said Robinson. \"I feel like you get all that from farming.\"",

      "Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be in Mexico, hoping to enter America, including through a program that allows them to use a smartphone app to request a time to be vetted, processed and admitted by American border officials. The system was established by the Biden administration to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, but many are now worried that President-elect Donald Trump will make it much harder for them to make it into the U.S. at all.",
      "Castro Santos said he's worried about Trump \"canceling the appointments\" offered by the U.S. government app, known as CBP One. \"We don't want to run that risk of going back and putting them at risk,\" he said, referring to his children. If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.",
      "Trump made tackling illegal immigration a central theme of his campaign, running on a platform of mass deportations, harsher asylum rules and a reversal of the Biden administration's border policies, including the app-powered entry system used by migrants in Mexico. His immigration promises appealed to many American voters, polls show, including those living near the southern border.",
      "Anna Parada, who was born and raised in Nogales, Arizona, just miles away from the border with Mexico, said the \"main\" reason she voted for Trump was because of his stance on immigration.",
      "\"I really saw the Biden administration being a little bit too lax on immigration,\" Parada said. \"And having Trump back in office, I believe it's going to be a difference again.\"",
      "On the Mexican side of the border, the reaction to Trump winning was dramatically different.",
      "Luz Angela, a migrant from Bolivia, said she felt \"scared\" when she learned American voters had elected Trump.",
      "\"I felt scared because he promised in his speeches that they would deport all the migrants,\" Angela said in Spanish. \"And that he would close the CBP One application.\"",
      "A doctor by trade, Angela said she and her 9-year-old son, Matias, fled political persecution in Bolivia. She said she was targeted by the government there after complaining about corruption in the hospital where she worked.",
      "Angela and her son have been waiting for a CBP One appointment for nearly 7 months since arriving in Nogales, Mexico. During her wait, she has volunteered as a doctor at the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter, treating fellow migrants.",
      "\"What we're looking for is for an opportunity to improve our lives but also perhaps improve the health care system over there,\" she said. \"I really like helping people who don't have easy access to healthcare.\"",
      "U.S. officials worry that Trump's election will end the months-long lull in illegal border crossings, which plunged this year following an aggressive effort by Mexican officials to interdict migrants and President Biden's move in June to make most of those crossing into the country illegally ineligible for asylum. Larger numbers of migrants, officials have said, could be incentivized to cross into the U.S. unlawfully in the coming weeks, before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Alba Jaramillo, a Tucson-based immigration attorney, said Trump's win and the potential end to the CBP One system, could prompt more migrants to cross the southern border without authorization, including along dangerous parts of the Arizona desert where some perish trying to make it into the U.S.",
      "\"They're desperate,\" said Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant organization. \"I mean they have given up everything to come to the north.\"",

      "A transitionary council created to reestablish democratic order in Haiti signed a decree Sunday firing the country's interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and replacing him with Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9, a businessman who was previously considered for the job.",
      "The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to the Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn't held democratic elections in years in large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation.",
      "Fils-Aim\u00e9 is the former president of Haiti's Chamber of Commerce and Industry and in 2015 ran an unsuccessful campaign for Senate. The businessman studied at Boston University and was previously considered for the position as a private sector candidate for the post before Conille took the seat.",
      "Conille, a longtime civil servant who has worked with the United Nations, served as prime minister for only six months. The AP on Sunday couldn't reach Conille or a spokesperson for him.",
      "The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti's next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille. Organizations like the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition, according to The Miami Herald.",
      "The process suffered another blow in October when a three of members on the council\u00a0faced corruption accusations, from anti-corruption investigators alleging that they demanded $750,000 in bribes from a government bank director to secure his job.",
      "The report was a significant blow to the nine-member council and is expected to further erode people's trust in it.",
      "Those same members accused of bribery, Smith Augustin, Emmanuel Vertilaire and Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, were among those to sign the decree. Only one member, Edgard Leblanc Fils, did not sign the order.",
      "The move by the transitional council came under fire by some in Haiti like former Justice Minister Bernard Gousse, who told local media that Conille's dismissal was \"illegal\" because the council was over-extending its powers and because of the corruption allegations levered against them.",

    "summary": "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" after bruising defeats in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" in the wake of the 2024 election, which delivered bruising blows to the party \u2014 and prompted a reckoning on the path forward.",
      "\"We did not have a compelling enough economic vision,\" Khanna, a California Democrat, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week, as the Democrats lost support from key demographic groups from the 2020 election. Khanna, a member of the party's progressive wing, attributed the fracturing among the Democratic coalition to the shortcomings in the party's economic message.",
      "\"The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans,\" Khanna said. \"Not just working-class Americans \u2014 a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.\"",
      "Khanna said new voices in Congress, like Reps. Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Chris Deluzio, have encouraged that Democrats need to tell a \"better economic story,\" emphasizing a vision of raising the minimum wage, addressing child care and building new factories.",
      "\"I think that can unify our party \u2014 moderates and progressives \u2014 and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, White working class voters,\" Khanna said. \"And we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.\"",
      "In the days since the election, some Democrats have expressed that the economic message should have been front and center in the campaign, while arguing that the party had a focus on identity politics. But Khanna said that while he's been clear on the importance of economic issues, \"I don't think we should run away\" from issues like standing up for transgender rights and equal rights.",
      "Khanna urged Democrats not to \"shy away from your convictions,\" adding that with the issues, along with a focus on the economy, the party can still be successful.",
      "\"I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue,\" Khanna said.",
      "In Michigan, Harris lost key support in Arab American areas amid Israel's war in Gaza. Khanna said he believes that Harris would have won Michigan \"if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza.\" He added that he has seen that even \"beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.\"",
      "Amid the hand wringing over the election, Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's late decision to leave the race and endorse Harris, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Khanna said while he has a \"lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi,\" he's \"chuckled\" at the idea.",
      "\"The day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over-the-top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing,\" Khanna said. \"So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.\"",
      "Khanna said Harris' was a \"winnable campaign,\" adding that \"anyone who is saying now 'this was not a winnable campaign' didn't say that back in August.\"",
      "\"The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground\" on emphasizing economic issues, Khanna said. \"The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance.\"",

      "As we wrap up campaign 2024, the scope of Republican control in Washington over the next few years is coming into focus. Overnight, CBS projected Donald Trump the winner in Arizona, giving him a complete electoral vote sweep of the seven battleground states.",
      "With a final tally of 312 electoral votes, Republicans scored their biggest White House win in 36 years. Republicans will also control the Senate with at least 52 seats, and there are two races that have not yet been called by CBS News. Control of the House is still to be determined with a few contests outstanding, but CBS News rates it as leaning Republican at this point.",

      "Bob, good to have you here.",
      "I know you have been speaking to your sources. What will the second term look like?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "In recent days, I have spoken to president-elect Trump, called him up on the phone, along with his top advisers and allies. And what's notable about this transition is that, unlike in 2016, when he was elected as a Washington outsider, now he knows all the players in Washington.",
      "And he alone, more than any other aid, is evaluating the personnel and possibilities around him. And he reflected in one of our conversations about how he sees his mandate, that he has a movement and a base and now a party that's fully behind him. And he wants to make sure that anyone who comes on board has his same vision for that mandate and for his perceived level of support.",
      "And you have seen in recent days people around Trump in the wider orbit are trying to recommend a lot of names, but it's Trump himself who's saying to his top aides like Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff, that he wants to make sure that this is not a chaotic process and it's reflective of where he wants to go, more than any other kind of counsel.",
      "And on foreign policy, for example, you see names like Senator Bill Hagerty, Senator Marco Rubio, former Ambassador Ric Grenell, all people who identify with Trump's vision. But those who have had issues with Trump in the past about how he perceives foreign policy, like, for example, former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary Mike Pompeo, are now out of the process.",
      "And it's not because of any personal trouble with Trump, I'm told. It's because, at the end of the day, Trump wants to make sure things are moving along smoothly on ideological and policy lines come January.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know what it was with Mike Pompeo, who served him quite loyally for four years as CIA director and secretary of state? Was it his support, for example, of Ukraine?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's just a different orbit around Trump right now. The president-elect has people like Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk. He has Steve Bannon on the outside advising him.",
      "These are people who are noninterventionists. These are people who aren't traditional Republican hawks. That's not to say some hawks won't end up in this administration or some Wall Street figures might end up in this administration as well.",
      "I'm told by my sources that the president-elect is not ruling out mainstream Republicans or more centrist Republicans from joining his team. But, at this point, he's moving quickly to make sure his base, his party, and his image is reflected in the personnel picks fully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are his priorities for the 1st 100 days? Or is that too traditional a way of thinking about it?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, they have a real agenda this time. You remember, in 2017, it was somewhat sporadic in how they moved and navigated on health care and taxes.",
      "They are moving quickly already behind the scenes to expand the Trump tax cuts, to institute sweeping tariffs across the board. They're also going to try to, on foreign policy, begin negotiations with Ukraine and Russia sometime early next year. And you have mass deportations, more than anything, galvanizing the Trump people behind the scenes.",
      "Of course, they know it's going to be controversial. To remove undocumented migrants in a big way across the country could be logistically difficult and politically challenging, but they're moving ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob Costa, thank you.",
      "And we turn now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Japan.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 during the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Oh, I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And",
      "I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine. I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.",
      "You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I have been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first.",
      "And I have taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No, but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion.",
      "That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. And with the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first.",
      "But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60-a-barrel cap. The argument they make, that reduces Russia's profits.",
      "What it does, actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with an energy cost advantage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out.",
      "Interestingly, interestingly, I will call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the E.U. say, maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's been talked about for some time.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around.",
      "The U.K. has said, we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5 percent, all since President Trump was elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was \u2013 was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine.",
      "So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that \u2013 is that the mandate?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I think President Trump will find \u2013 President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment. You have Chinese equipment.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Deeply concerning, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield.",
      "So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are extensive sanctions on Russia, whether or not they're\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Iran, we had them shut down. Iran was broke. Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. We had a maximum pressure campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign \u2013 President Trump led this.",
      "We were able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: The Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Nothing to the level that we've seen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.",
      "But, on the Middle East. Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No. And, if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is, we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department, the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The U.N. says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine.",
      "If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I have had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law. It's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes. Well, I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70-plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that leads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe \u2013 you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I would like to see what \u2013 I would like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to \u2013 again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters. Certainly, in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that.",
      "Do you think \u2013 and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause, to borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration.",
      "He's going to focus on Iran, because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened\u2026",

      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific.",
      "The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a businessperson negotiates.",
      "Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War, a significant investment on behalf of the American people.",
      "Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Today, they are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss, within the level of support\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible to strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan.",
      "They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP. That's a positive development.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They're trying to work more closely with us. I think, in President Trump's administration, they definitely will.",
      "This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his Cabinet, if asked?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I will just say this.",
      "I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee serving in the United States Senate.",
      "In whatever role I hold going \u2013 going forward, it's going to be advanced - - it's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I will do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.",
      "Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years.",
      "And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues, including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these \u2013 these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now.",
      "We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last 2.5 years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.",
      "And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got, like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that, by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized.",
      "And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",
      "And, ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.",
      "But President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos.",
      "What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 in the most dramatic and full-throated way one could \u2013 could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia.",
      "We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Hagerty was saying it's \u2013 Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting.",
      "They have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine \u2013 for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong-un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure.",
      "And, frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going-forward basis.",
      "But I will tell you this. Kim Jong-un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or 10 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea in both directions is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is coming to the White House. That was just announced.",
      "What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and \u2013 and he'll speak to his decisions.",
      "Here's what I see. First, in Gaza, it really today is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease-fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease-fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Hamas has said no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Mr. \u2013 Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made.",
      "What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is, no, we will not do a cease-fire-and- hostage deal at this time.",
      "So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction.",
      "And then, when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Those should remain behind closed doors.",
      "But we do believe that, at some point, the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel. And I expect that, in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account?",
      "Because the secretaries of state and defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So, basically, what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the president confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as Salt Typhoon?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber- enabled espionage, about cyberattacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, and our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And, of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",

      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that. But, Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical, political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy. The course of this, a political discourse. The idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues is about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections. And I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028. In one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck.",
      "But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020, you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids. And you have new voices, Congress people like Pat Ryan, Mary - Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that can unify our party, moderates and progressives, and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, black voters, white working class voters. And we had a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting, in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening, to hear from so many Democrats now who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up, talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police, and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement, woke politics, really was incredibly damaging to the left? Because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in - on which you are a member.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues. But I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation.",
      "The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing. I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley while towns like Johnstown (ph) were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois, were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Joe Biden - President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us, on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district, since you just mentioned it. Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk significantly. And J.D. Vance, the vice presidential candidate, he really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign.",
      "What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it - is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70 percent of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: But you're right that we had slippage, and probably now 20 percent, 30 percent support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto.",
      "But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley. And we can be the party that helps AI and robotics build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country.",
      "When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans and prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told \"The New York Times\" there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said, there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible.",
      "Do you agree with her?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled with people have said this about President Biden because the day he got out we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.",
      "I think this was a winnable campaign, even when he got out. Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now this was not a winnable campaign didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win ultimately is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground. People like Chris Deluzio, Pat Wright (ph), who were saying, talk about the economy. Talk about people's economic struggles. Have - convince people you have the better policies and better vision.",
      "The reason I'm hopeful for the future is, we have the substance. We actually - you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris. And on this program you defended both many times. One place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims, you heard there was a problem here.",
      "Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. And that wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground.",
      "I also think, beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.",
      "Now, my hope is, because President Trump got some of the votes from the Muslim and Arab community, I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia, they have said that if the president wants a deal with Saudi Arabia that the Palestinian state and a two-state solution has to be front and center, and I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna. Congressman, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari. He joins us now.",
      "Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (Minneapolis Federal Reserve President): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seemed to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here.",
      "Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are - show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. So, right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5 percent or so. So, we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job. But so far so good. I mean I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job. But we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. Are - you're - it sounds like you're expecting another rate cut?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2 percent target. So, if you look at the - what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out, the expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions. And that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible.",
      "But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market, that's going to - that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical. But we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations.",
      "When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation. You said, in some ways it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods.",
      "How long before we would see the economic impact of say a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question, Margaret. I mean I think - if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what \u2013 you know, how they would adjust to that and how - how long it would take and how disruptive it would be.",
      "I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainly about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We, at the Fed, will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the president-elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add $8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, if you look over the long-term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably. So, at some point, those have to be addressed. And that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is, whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2 percent inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that.",
      "But, you're right, over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed. But that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, it - the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5 percent increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one-time tariff. So, if somebody imposed a 1 percent tariff or a 10 percent tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1 percent or 10 percent. That's pretty easy to model and it shouldn't have an effect long-run on inflation.",
      "The challenge becomes if there's a tit for tat and it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses and it's escalating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: That's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain.",
      "So I think, again, with - as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just - right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to business and labor unions all around my region it's one of cautious optimism, that the economy is doing well, there are jobs available. And we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. And so, right now, I would say, we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing. And our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked. He made clear he does not think that the law would require that. And, in fact, it would violate the law.",
      "But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making. And that will continue to do so.",
      "And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So, the governors at the board of governors in Washington serve up to 14-year terms. The presidents of the reserve banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity. Between that and, I think, bipartisan support, that we all want to get inflation back down to 2 percent and we want to keep the economy strong, I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",

      "DAME KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ambassador, after this election there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said, \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's prime minister said, \"don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\"",
      "What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience, Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine. I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the U.S., and it certainly emboldens China. And I don't think anyone in the U.S. wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally, he's friends with Vladamir Putin and Donald Trump, he said, \"the situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine.",
      "Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration plans are. But certainly, I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting what's next?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We speak to Donald Trump. The prime minister spoke to him very recently on the Wednesday after, the day after the election.",
      "In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10 percent across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the U.K. may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so, as the U.K. You know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach for many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments is a hugely important part of what we do with America. Something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment in trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda. And we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current U.K. government is a different one, of course, from that period of time, with the Labour Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote, \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\"",
      "Are you concerned that those past statements, and the ideological differences, will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the vice president-elect, have also said critical things about President Trump.",
      "In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues.",
      "You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I won't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological. And I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it. Thank you for watching. Happy birthday, Marines!",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Army veteran Myron Hennen hadn't had a car in 18 months - not easy in Grand Forks, North Dakota, a small city with frigid temperatures for most of the year, large open expanses and a tight-knit veteran community.",
      "The 68-year-old said he was struggling with mental health issues and was arrested for various charges including theft and possession of drug paraphernalia. His car was impounded by police and he was assigned to veterans' treatment court, where Hennen said he got help for the first time.",
      "\"By the time I got it diagnosed and treated and started to get my life under control, I had very little money,\" he wrote in a September letter.",
      "Hennen told CBS News he didn't have enough to get his car back.",
      "Hennen said he was living off a small Social Security payment and was isolated in his home in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, right across the river from Grand Forks \u2014 until he met\u00a0Larry Mendivil Jr.\u00a0through a coordinator at the court.",
      "Mendivil, an Air Force veteran who had been deployed five times and worked on inspections and repairs, struggled to ease back into civilian life.",
      "\"I was actually homeless for a little while,\" he said.",
      "The military, he said, \"trains you for war but don't train how to live when you get out.\"",
      "Navigating life in Grand Forks, or other rural areas without a car can be daunting.",
      "\"The most important thing in North Dakota is you got to have something here to drive. Everyone here knows how important a car is,\" said Mendivil.",
      "Sobriety and stability can come with transportation",
      "Nearly a quarter of U.S. veterans \u2014 4.4 million \u2014 live in rural communities and a large portion struggle with poverty, isolation and access to healthcare. Transportation can be key for many military members returning to civilian life \u2014 but researchers found it's often an afterthought.",
      "Researchers Andrea Lubin and Stephanie Dipetrillo found transport access should be considered \"an essential service\" without which veterans \"can have a difficult time reintegrating into civilian life,\" they wrote in a 2015 report for the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "For many, a vehicle is a necessity: 71.6% of workers living at the poverty level use personal vehicles to get to work. Without transportation, veterans can become isolated and that can exacerbate underlying mental health issues and other struggles. About 35,574 veterans, like Mendivil, experienced homelessness in 2023 in the U.S., according to Veterans Affairs.",
      "Experts say that since American society is organized around automobiles, having a vehicle is essential to making money.",
      "Mendivil told Hennen he had a 2007 Honda Accord that needed a new battery, alternator, and starter but he would fix it, for free. It was a kindness, Hennen said, that changed his entire situation.",
      "Lubin, managing director at Rutgers University's Voorhees Transportation Center told CBS News veterans interviewed for their report said \"transportation costs\" or cars were rarely discussed with assisting organizations after they returned stateside.",
      "Mendivil, 42, found his way back to sobriety and stability through cars. He started helping his uncle, a mechanic, around his shop. Mendivil was fixing cars when he got a call from an old Air Force buddy.",
      "His Suzuki truck had stalled and his buddy couldn't get to his new job, a setback he was sure would get him fired and imperil the fragile life he just started to rebuild. Mendivil drove an hour to his friend's house, picked him up and dropped him off at work. But then he went the extra step, and fixed the truck, showing his friend some mechanical skills in the process.",
      "He then launched the nonprofit Miracles for Vets, or Mv4, which assists veterans with rides, fixes their cars and donates repaired vehicles to veterans who don't have transportation.",
      "\"It's a brotherhood\"",
      "On a scrappy budget of less than $50,000 a year, Mendivil said he's helped 300 veterans fix their cars over the years and just gave away his 45th vehicle. His methods, he says, are relatively straightforward. He keeps it about the veterans and the vehicle.",
      "\"We are so small and we've all been in the military. It's a brotherhood,\" Ross Weiler, the foundation's board chair, told CBS News. He said, \"Larry is a gearhead, and I'm a gearhead.\"",
      "Miracles for Vets works out of a garage on Dyke Avenue in Grand Forks, partnering with different suppliers to fix the cars that come through. Auto Glass and Automakers have donated four windshields to cars for veterans, and Mendivil said the company gives \"a free install for the windshield if we are out of money and if it's for a veteran.\"",
      "Grand Forks Treatment Court sends mandated workers to help out at the garage in the afternoons, Mendivil said, otherwise it's mainly just him and one other mechanic fixing cars. Veterans sometimes congregate at the garage just to see the vehicles the organization is working on or get a tune-up of their own.",
      "Donald Lapham, 61, said Miracles for Vets has helped him with his 2006 GMC Sierra truck when the transmission doesn't work. He spent 17 years in the Army reserves and now lives in his truck, Lapham said, \"dealing with depression and bad knees.\"",
      "Mendivil said there hasn't been one car he hasn't donated at least $500 in parts and $2,000 for labor. His girlfriend does all the accounting, and his son,11, helps out in the garage.",
      "\"I'll never be an important person, yet helping veterans to stay mobile and giving them free cars is super important to me,\" Mendivil said.",
      "Hennen, the veteran who got the 2007 Honda Accord agreed. Once he had his car he didn't have to take the bus to the grocery store. That trip, he said, would take him about an hour each way, and was tough in the \"rough winters.\" Now Hennen said, he jumps in his car and drives 10 minutes each way. He is planning on visiting his three granddaughters who live 300 miles away.",
      "\"Having a car in my life gave me a feeling of freedom,\" said Hennen. \"I could go anywhere I want to go, how I want to go and I could go where I wanted to go.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 09:57:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Researching her family history, Cheryl Wills found she was related to a former slave who served in the Civil War with the United States Colored Troops, which led her to a distant relative, a former plantation, and ultimately to Private Sandy Wills' remains.",
    "story": [
      "This past August Army Private Sandy Wills was buried with full military honors at a veterans' cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Private Wills served his country, though not in this century, or the last. He died in 1889.",
      "He was originally laid to rest in an unmarked grave, a Civil War veteran all but lost to history.",
      "\"No one knew about Sandy Wills,\" said Cheryl wills, Sandy's great-great-great-granddaughter. \"An enslaved man leaves a plantation, serves during the Civil War with Lincoln's army, and poof!\u00a0 Like it never happened.\"",
      "Cheryl didn't know of him, or her family's long military legacy, until she started researching her ancestry. And it was tragedy that first sparked her interest in genealogy.",
      "Her father, a New York City firefighter and Vietnam-era veteran, was killed in a motorcycle accident when she was a teenager. She recalled, \"When I sat at his funeral, the one thing that was burned into my heart was when the military honored him. And then they handed my mother a folded flag. And at that moment, I realized my father was special in the eyes of the greatest army in the world.\"",
      "Like millions of Black Americans, Cheryl's family had left the South as part of the Great Migration. Her grandparents moved from Tennessee to New York City. For the past 30 years, Cheryl, an author and journalist, has been telling other people's stories, all the while knowing little of her own.",
      "When asking her family about the past, she said, \"No one knew anything. And that was one question I used to ask them: 'What do you know about slavery?' And they would look at me like, 'What kind of question is that?' Those who lived through slavery, it was like they had this pact: We're not passing this story down. You don't want to know what it was like.\u00a0So, Sandy's story disappeared from our family.\"",
      "Combing through census, birth, marriage and death records, Cheryl meticulously traced the roots and branches of her family tree. The earliest ancestor she was able to document: Sandy Wills, who was bought by Willis Wills when he was 10 years old.",
      "The Holy Grail of her search was Sandy Wills' military records. He'd volunteered for the colored troops in 1863 and was honorably discharged. He worked as a sharecropper on the Moore plantation after the war, and married a woman named Emma; they had nine children. Records showed when Sandy died, but Cheryl could find no trace of where he was buried. \"He was nowhere to be found, essentially MIA,\" she said.",
      "Her search did lead her to a living relative, Ethan West, a distant cousin also researching his family. \"She was going through finding Sandy, and I've been posting a lot of stuff about my lineage,\" he said. \"And our lineages collided.\"",
      "She called Ethan her hero: \"He physically went down there.\"",
      "\"Down there\" is Brownsville, in Haywood County, Tennessee. They both had come across records placing some of their ancestors, including Sandy Wills, on a plantation there owned by the Moore family. \"I just wanted to know what this place that we're reading about looked like,\" said West. \"I found the coordinates to where the property would have been.\"",
      "In 2013, West went driving around Haywood County looking for answers, and literally saw a sign: Mooreland. \"And when he texted me that sign, I went, holy guacamole,\" said Cheryl. \"And I think both of our lives changed.\"",
      "Mooreland is 900 lush acres of cotton, soybeans and pecan trees. Over the years, Cheryl and Ethan would visit, and gradually formed a unique bond with the Moore descendants, telling them of their family's connections to the farm \u2013 and their belief that a Civil War veteran was buried on their property.",
      "And the Moores told them something they had hoped to hear \u2013 that there is an unmarked African American burial ground on their farm. \u00a0\"They took me there, and for that, I'm eternally grateful,\" said Cheryl. \"Because we had no idea it was there. We only had a hunch.\"",
      "Cheryl hired an archeology team with experience finding America's missing-in-action from more recent wars. Of the 38 graves they found here, they zeroed in on one \u2013 its size, date, and fragmentary remains matched every known detail of her ancestor.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" was there with the families and local veterans when Private Sandy Wills' remains were placed in a casket, and solemnly marched from the knoll, through green fields, to a waiting hearse.",
      "Edie Moore, the family matriarch, said that for generations the Moores kept that African-American cemetery on their property untouched. \"A farmer would come along and say, 'Oh, if it were me, I would just bulldoze down that clump of trees and plant on top of it,\" said Edie. \"We said, 'No, it's hallowed ground. And we will never ever touch it.' And my husband, he had daffodils that he planted over the whole cemetery.\"",
      "Knowing it was the resting place for Private Wills, she said, \"adds depth to the whole experience.\"",
      "After the exhumation, the Moores hosted a picnic at the farm \u2013 two families connected by this land, and by America's complicated history.",
      "A headstone now marks Sandy Wills' grave at the West Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery. For Cheryl Wills, it's mission accomplished.",
      "\"History really meant for him to be anonymous forever,\" she said. \"He was a man without a legacy for 135 years. And now, it's been taken back.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 09:13:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Twenty years after being grievously wounded in the Battle of Fallujah, losing his left leg to a roadside bomb, the battlefield medic has recovered from his traumatic injuries, grown his family, and turned to music to honor his fallen comrades.",
    "story": [
      "We first met Joe Dan Worley 20 years ago, along with his mother, wife Angel, and a three-month-old daughter, at Walter Reed Hospital outside Washington.",
      "A medic rushing to the aid of wounded Marines in Iraq, Worley was hit by a roadside bomb \u2013 his left leg blown off, his right riddled with bullets. \"When I hit the ground, I was purely convinced that my entire body was just ravaged, I mean, that I was dead,\" he said.",
      "His mother said, \"Our life is just turned upside-down.\"",
      "It wasn't just Worley's grievous wounds; the cost of moving to Washington to be with him had drained the family savings. They didn't even have enough for the baby's winter clothes.",
      "Then, his mother said \"an angel\" walked in the door: \"She just sat down and started talking to all of us, and just wrote out a check and handed it to the kids.\"",
      "That angel was sent by Karen Guenther, who was an ICU nurse at Camp Pendleton, California, when the wounded started coming in. \"I believe God just put me in the right place at the right time,\" she said. \"I was standing next to a young spouse, and she was about 18 years old, and her husband, he was very disfigured, and she looked at him and her knees started to buckle. So, I sort of held her and whispered in her ear and I said, 'You've got this, you can do this.' And just experiencing that changed everything.\"",
      "Guenther had experience dealing with traumatic injuries, but she said what was so different in this case was that \"this was so personal, and the number of injuries that we saw coming back, the severity of the injuries coming back, were historic.\"",
      "Many of them were coming back from the all-out battle for the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah. \"We saw the families coming from all across the country to be by their son or daughter's bedside,\" Guenther said. \"They were leaving their jobs, leaving their homes, but yet they still had to have a car payment and a mortgage, and they just simply couldn't do it. So, that's when we started the fund.\"",
      "She called it the Semper Fi & America's Fund. \"I didn't know anything about starting a nonprofit, so I went to Barnes & Noble and I bought every book I could on nonprofits,\" she said. \"'Nonprofits for Dummies' was my very first book!\"",
      "The Battle of Fallujah raged for seven weeks. \"It was overwhelming,\" said Guenther. \"At that time we did not have much money in the bank, enough to take care of the number of wounded coming back.\"",
      "Until the public met Joe Dan Worley, who told \"60 Minutes\" in 2004, \"I worry all the time about being able to take care of my family, you know, and wondering what the future is going to hold.\"",
      "Guenther said, \"If that piece hadn't run, we would not have had the funds to take care of the families.\"",
      "To date, the Semper Fi Fund has given $500 million to 33,000 service members and their families \u2013 not just Marines, but all the armed services.",
      "In the beginning, the fund was focused on responding at the bedside of the wounded. But the real work started once service members went home. \"If you come back and you're quadriplegic or you're a triple amputee, or even a simple, single amputee, there's a life cycle of recovery,\" said Guenther, \"and these young men and women would need us for the rest of their lives.\"",
      "Worley was walking, but still wounded. His marriage to Angel was on the rocks. \"It was a really rough patch,\" he said.",
      "\"Something had to change or we weren't going to make it,\" said Angel.",
      "Martin said, \"That would have been a real shame.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it would have,\" she replied. \"I think what made us work is we didn't give up on each other at the same time.\"",
      "Worley added, \"There are not many marriages that make it through what we've made it through.\"",
      "He started working out, with a vengeance, and their family kept growing. Abby, who turned one while her father was still at Walter Reed, is now 20. She has a sister and two brothers.",
      "Worley supplements his disability benefits by co-hosting a podcast for the American Legion. Even so, a case worker from Semper Fi checks in once a month. \"For 20 years, they're always there,\" said Angel. \"Like, we know if we really truly needed anything, we could ask.\"",
      "Martin asked, \"Would you call yourself happy today?\"",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" Angel replied. \"I always tell people, if you can make it through the hard times, what's on the other side is so much better. It's so worth it. Life is so good. We are so blessed.\"",
      "But, Guenther said, not all of their stories are success stories: \"Our warriors are proud and strong and courageous, but sometimes they wear a mask, and they don't allow others to see how much pain they're going through, or the brain damage from blasts and concussion injuries.\"",
      "Do they know of people who have lost their marriages? \"We do, especially our catastrophic injuries,\" she said. \"Oftentimes, right after the injury, the families, their adrenaline's going \u2013 I can do this, I'm going to stay by my husband or wife's side \u2013 but as the years go on, it can be very tough on marriages.\"",
      "Living on the outskirts of Atlanta, the Worley family is rich in the things that matter, with a pet pig on the side. But Joe Dan will never be free of Fallujah. For the 20th anniversary of the battle, he's turned to music, recording a song, \"The Ballad of JoeDan.\"",
      "\"This is my song, that is for my guys that got killed while I was over there,\" he said. \"I'm carrying these people in my heart, not on my back, but in my heart.\"",
      "\"The Ballad of JoeDan\" is full of sorrow, but the life he has made is full of purpose. \"The body probably could have done without a traumatic amputation, but I really love what I've grown into,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 09:00:16 -0500",
    "summary": "About 7,000 U.S. women served overseas as nurses during the Vietnam War. These veterans are working to ensure their contributions are honored on Veterans' Day 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Between 1967 and 1968, Nancy Wells spent her waking hours stitching injured Americans back together amid the haze of the Vietnam War, treating wounds she'd never imagined seeing.",
      "When not on the hospital wards, Wells and her fellow nurses lived like other soldiers: They ate at the same mess hall, slept in the same Quonset-hut dorms, called hooches, and were jolted out of bed by the same alarms and explosions. Some nurses suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. And all were subject to the same upheaval and protests when they returned stateside.",
      "Yet after the war, there was far less support and community for nurses and little recognition from the public of what they went through overseas. On Veterans' Day, nurses gather at the Vietnam Women's Memorial, which was built in 1993 after years of advocacy, to honor the service of the \"forgotten veterans.\"",
      "\"It seemed like the choppers would never stop coming in\"",
      "About 7,000 American women served in Vietnam as nurses during the war. Many, like Wells, were recruited from nursing school. Those who completed the Army's student nurse program and passed state nursing exams were commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the Army Nurse Corps. While overseas, they often served in multiple hospitals during one-year tours.\u00a0Wells worked at the 85th Evacuation Hospital in Qui Nohn and at the 71st Evacuation Hospital at Pleiku. There, she said, red alerts that meant enemy and hostile fire in the area became a part of daily life.",
      "\"You'd have to throw on your steel pot (helmet) and your flak jacket and go over to the hospital wards\" when the alarm went off, Wells, now 80 and living in Michigan, told CBS News. \"The siren would be blaring. Initially, it was a little frightening. You could hear the gunfire off in the distance. But after enough red alerts, you kind of became used to it.\"",
      "Even when the world around them was calm, there were always soldiers in need in the hospital wards. At the 71st Evacuation Hospital, there often weren't enough staff members to cover the 400 beds. Wells said she and her fellow nurses would work six or even seven days a week there, \"depending on the casualties coming in.\" During one period in November 1967, she said there were three weeks of nonstop casualties, coming so fast that medical personnel were flown in from other locations to help the 71st. During this period, the Battle of Dak To was taking place in Vietnam's Central Highlands. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war.",
      "\"There were days when it seemed like the choppers would never stop coming in with the wounded,\" said Wells. \"Those were hard days, and the wounds the guys were coming in with were horrendous.\"",
      "In January 1968, the hospital was in the path of the Tet Offensive, a major military campaign by Vietnamese forces. Some hospital wards at the 71st were closed because \"it was felt that we were in too dangerous of an area to keep very many wounded\" soldiers, Wells said. Meanwhile, Wells and her other nurses moved into the hospital, because it was deemed a safer place than their hooches.",
      "Even when the crises slowed down, nurses like Wells had duties that went far beyond what they might do at a hospital in the United States. Wells said doctors assigned to the wards might only be there once or twice a week, so nurses would write orders for infection treatment and pain medications. They also cared for delayed wound closures, which meant carefully monitoring a non-critical wound for a week before it was surgically repaired. Medical personnel also did outreach work, treating injuries and giving vaccinations to some Vietnamese civilians when conditions allowed.",
      "On top of that, the nurses passed medications, checked IVs and bandages, gave injections and did everything they could to keep soldiers' spirits high. For Wells, caring for the soldiers she affectionately calls \"her boys\" meant sometimes skirting regulations.",
      "\"One of my boys came up to me in his wheelchair, and he said, 'Ma'am, is there anything to eat?' I'm hungry.' I told him 'No, but I know where to get some food,'\" said Wells. \"This was late at night. I snuck down to the chow hall, and didn't see anybody, so I took an entire sheet cake and took it back up to the ward so my boys could have a midnight snack.\"",
      "\"We didn't send women to Vietnam\"",
      "Wells came home from Vietnam on Easter Sunday in 1968. Her supervisor recommended she change out of her uniform to avoid negative attention in the airport, but she was determined to \"walk tall\" as she reunited with her family.",
      "Soon, though, Wells realized she was having a hard time adjusting back to civilian life. It took two months before she could bear to work as a nurse again, and she felt that she could no longer connect with her old friends. Whenever they talked about parties and beauty salons, she could only think about the conditions she had spent the past year in \u2014 the conditions her \"boys\" were still experiencing.",
      "She and her husband, a fellow Vietnam veteran, both struggled to talk about their experiences in the country \u2014 something she said likely contributed to their divorce. She struggled to sleep at night, and couldn't bear being in a large crowd or hearing the sounds of helicopters. Wells would later be diagnosed with and treated for PTSD.",
      "In 1980, she felt she was ready to connect with other veterans, so she went to her local VFW. She had identification confirming her service but was rebuffed and told she could join the Ladies Auxiliary, a volunteer group for women and family members who did not serve. The organization was rebranded as the VFW Auxiliary in 2015.",
      "\"I walked into the building, I was met by a gentlemen ... and told him that I wanted to join. And he said 'The VFW is for veterans,'\" Wells recalled. \"He couldn't believe that I was a veteran, just the same as he was. I walked out and never went back.\"",
      "That wasn't an unusual experience for nurses coming home. Constance Evans, who spent a year serving at the 12th Evacuation Hospital in Cu Chi, said she was invited to join the Ladies Auxiliary, but not welcomed into her local VFW in Idaho. She spent months campaigning to be part of the latter organization and was eventually accepted.\u00a0Evans, who is part of the Nez Perce tribe, said she was also excluded from a tribal ceremony honoring veterans for years. Donna Barbisch, a former Vietnam nurse and retired Army officer, remembered talking to a woman who didn't know any American women had been overseas.",
      "\"She was expressing negative sentiment about the war, and I told her that I thought she had some of the facts mixed up,\" Barbisch, 77, who lives in Washington, D.C. now, recalled. \"And she said 'Oh, how would you know?' I said 'I was there.' She said, 'Oh, no, you weren't there, we didn't send women to Vietnam.'\"",
      "\"'Yes, I am a veteran'\"",
      "For decades, Wells and other nurses who served in Vietnam tried to put the war out of their heads and get on with life at home. Some, like Barbisch, went back to the Army. Others, including Wells, returned to civilian medicine. Many nurses who had served together lost contact. Some received services through the VA, though Evans said it took years of fighting and appeals to have her post-traumatic stress disorder considered a disability by the agency.",
      "All of the women interviewed for this story said that their work during the war and the struggles they experienced afterward were something they rarely talked about, even with close friends and family.",
      "That changed in 1984 when Vietnam veteran Diane Carlson Evans co-founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation with two other former nurses. The foundation began lobbying Congress to erect a memorial honoring Vietnam nurses on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Congress approved the construction of the statue in 1988, and the memorial was dedicated on Veterans Day in 1993. Thousands of veterans, including Wells, participated in a march that culminated at the memorial, which shows three nurses caring for fallen soldiers.",
      "\"We marched down Constitution Avenue, and people were lining the streets shouting 'Welcome home, welcome home,'\" Wells said. \"One woman came up to me and said 'You saved my husband.' And that was great. It was amazing, it was uplifting.\"",
      "The legacy of the Vietnam nurses is now remembered with statewide celebrations and annual gatherings at the memorial. It's a welcome change from the silence and shame that accompanied their initial return home, Evans said.",
      "\"It really helped me come out and say 'Yes, I am a veteran, and I served in a war,'\" she said. \"I finally became very proud of what I did.\"",

    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 An emperor penguin found malnourished far from its Antarctic home on the Australian south coast is being cared for by a wildlife expert, a government department said Monday.",
      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on a popular tourist beach in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, according to a statement from the Western Australia state's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, Australia's neighbor almost entirely south of Denmark. It is believed to be the furthest north \u2014 and thus the furthest from their natural habitat \u2014 that a wild emperor penguin has ever been spotted.",
      "\"The furthest north they go from Antarctica is about 50 degrees south [latitude] from my readings and Ocean Beach is 35 degrees south,\" Cannell told Australia's national broadcaster ABC last week. \"So, a lot further north than what they've ever tracked\u00a0emperor\u00a0penguins from Antarctica before.\"",
      "Could the Arctic be ice-free within a decade?",
      "Could the Arctic be ice-free within a decade?",
      "Cannell said she had no idea why the penguin traveled to Australia's coast. She's advising seabird rehabilitator Carol Biddulph, who's caring for the penguin, spraying him with a chilled water mist to help him cope with his alien climate.",
      "The penguin is 39 inches tall and initially weighed 51 pounds. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The Western Australia biodiversity department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the animal. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that \"options are still being worked through.\"",
      "ABC said last week that the errant animal was first spotted by a local surfer from Denmark, Aaron Fowler, who told the network he and some friends were baffled when they first saw it coming out of the water.",
      "\"It stood up in the waves and just waddled straight up to us, an emperor penguin, he was probably about a meter high, and he was not shy at all,\" Fowler told ABC.",
      "\"There is always a bit of wildlife in the water but never a penguin,\" he said. \"He tried to do like, a slide on his on his belly, thinking it was snow I guess, and just face-planted in the sand and stood up and shook all the sand off.\"",
      "Emperor penguins are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",
      "The penguins breed and live on sea ice, but the\u00a0Antarctic Sea ice is disappearing\u00a0as our planet warms up.",
      "\"They show up at the breeding season and the ice isn't there, so they have nowhere to breed,\" Dr. Birgitte McDonald, an ecologist at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, which is funded and administered by San Jose State University, told CBS San Francisco last year.",
      "An analysis by scientists at Cambridge University, published last year in the journal Science News found that \"ice in one area was melting especially early in the year,\" putting emperor chicks at extreme risk.",
      "\"Emperor penguins - their survival, their ability to reproduce - is 100% tied to having appropriate sea ice,\" McDonald told CBS San Francisco.",

      "As delegates from nearly 200 countries gather for a major international summit on addressing the threat of climate change, they're confronting a new era of uncertainty for the United States' climate commitments in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election victory.",
      "Trump has said that in a second term, he would again exit the Paris Climate Agreement, an accord signed in 2016 aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The U.S. formally withdrew during Trump's first term, but then rejoined under President Biden.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Trump transition office for more information about his plans.",
      "The United States joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty, in 1992 and has attended its conferences \u2014 known as COP, for \"Conference of Parties\" \u2014 in many years since, most recently last year's COP28 in Dubai.",

      "What is COP29?",
      "This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference \u2014 called COP29, since it's the 29th Conference of Parties \u2014 kicks off Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and runs through Nov. 22.",
      "The annual summit, which is held in a different location every year, brings together world leaders and thousands of other representatives of nations that are party to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Their goal is to take stock of the progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0 \u2014 each country sets it own targets and action plan \u2014 and limiting global warming.",

      "Without greater reductions over the next few years, the world is on a path to see a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to an October U.N. report, which warned such an outcome \"would bring debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies.\"",
      "Under the Paris Agreement, countries update their targets for emission cuts (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) every five years. The next update is due in February.",
      "Who's going to COP29?",
      "This year, President Biden is sending a delegation that includes John Podesta, the senior presidential adviser for international climate policy, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser. Vice President Kamala Harris represented the U.S. at last year's conference.",
      "The gathering in Baku will be smaller than some previous summits for several reasons, including fewer attendance passes and hotel spaces, and concerns over Azerbaijan's human rights record and its oil-production-based economy.",
      "A number of other world leaders have opted not to attend this year, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. California Gov. Gavin Newsom isn't going either, although California often has a strong presence at the conference.",
      "Higher attendance is expected at next year's COP30 in Brazil, whose president shown a greater commitment to tackling emissions and climate finance.",
      "What will a Trump presidency mean for U.S. involvement in global climate efforts?",
      "Experts say that withdrawing from major climate agreements has the potential to isolate the U.S. in global climate negotiations and could encourage other high-emitting nations like China to deprioritize their emissions reductions. Leaving the Paris Agreement would mean the U.S. does not have to report on its emissions each year, and it would have weaker legal responsibilities to provide climate finance to developing countries.",
      "But while exiting these global commitments would be a major setback in the eyes of climate advocates, it wouldn't stop state and local governments, businesses or nonprofits from stepping up.",
      "In the wake of Trump's victory, several climate advocacy organizations released a flurry of statements reiterating their commitment to clean energy investments, carbon emission reduction and environmental protection. States and local governments are also expected to continue investing in initiatives like cap-and-invest programs, carbon neutrality, and infrastructure improvements.",
      "Other countries are also not likely to throw away their climate commitments.",
      "\"I am struck by the last time this happened, even with the shock, not a single other country followed the United States in withdrawing from the agreement,\" said Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and a former special envoy for climate change at the State Department.",
      "Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would take at least a year to complete, and a future president would have the power to rejoin if they so choose \u2014 just as President Biden did after Trump exited the agreement during his first term.",
      "A withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the other hand, could have an even greater long-term impact. Exiting the global treaty would remove the U.S. from the international stage of climate discussions and could hamper the country's ability to participate in negotiations in the future. The U.S. Senate ratified joining the UNFCCC in 1992, which legal experts say could make withdrawal a more complex process.",

      "Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema banned all demonstrations over the weekend in the aftermath of the grim scenes of youths on scooters and on foot attacking Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters on Thursday and Friday in what was widely condemned as a violent outburst of antisemitism in the Dutch capital.",
      "Israel's ambassador to the Netherlands said that 2,000 Israelis were brought home on special flights from Amsterdam over the past few days. The attacks left five Israeli soccer fans hospitalized, and came as anger grows over the war in the Gaza.",
      "Before the match against Ajax, Maccabi fans staged a pro-Israel demonstration in central Amsterdam where they chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights.",
      "Video shows a group of fans chanting \"Let the Israeli army win\" and \"**** the Arabs\" while dressed in gear to support their team, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reported. More footage shows the Palestinian flag being torn down from the second story of a building in the area where fans had gathered, by an individual who had climbed on top of the awning on the building's lower level to reach it.",
      "In the aftermath of the violent attacks against Israeli soccer fans that followed, one man who had traveled to the Netherlands for the Maccabi match told CBS News: \"It was very frightening. I saw people get beaten.\"",
      "Video on local broadcaster AT5 showed police detaining one man Sunday who was taking part in a small demonstration on the central Dam Square. The protesters yelled slogans including \"Free, free Palestine.\" AT5 reported that about 20 people were detained.",
      "Amsterdam Municipality said on X that police had begun arresting demonstrators who refused to leave the square, which is in the heart of the city's downtown shopping area and close to the historic canal network.",
      "Organizers of the protest went to court on Sunday morning seeking an injunction to allow the demonstration, but a judge upheld the ban imposed by the municipality.",
      "At the hearing, senior Amsterdam police officer Olivier Dutilh said that there were again incidents overnight targeting people thought to be Jewish, including some being ordered out of taxis and others being asked to produce their passports to confirm their nationality.",
      "Police launched a large-scale investigation Friday after gangs of youths conducted what Amsterdam's mayor called \"hit and run\" attacks on fans that were apparently inspired by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested.",

He met on Saturday with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and said in a statement that the attacks and demands to show passports \"were reminiscent of dark periods in history.\"",

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Negrin. \"But it's fact.\"",

      "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut and far from the areas in southern and eastern Lebanon where the militant Hezbollah group has a major presence. Lebanon's Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",
      "Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said the dead include nine women, and that the toll was likely to rise as rescue efforts continue.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a site where militants were operating in Jabaliya, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review.",
      "A separate strike on Sunday hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders organization that operates under the government.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said famine is imminent in the north or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas' attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to an all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday's strike in Aalmat, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",

Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",

      "No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.",
      "According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying \"an extraordinary price\" for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "But he said the losses were for \"tiny increments of land,\" and that Moscow's mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.",
      "Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for \"as long as it takes\" to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.",
      "On Sunday, the Kremlin's official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump's upcoming presidency, saying: \"At least, he talks about peace \u2026 he does not talk about confrontation.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 13:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "In Brazil\u00b4s Amazonas state, almost 6,000 riverine dwellers authorized to fish have reported a significant drop in production and rising costs.",
    "story": [
      "Two years of record-breaking drought have dealt a heavy blow to what is arguably the Amazon's most successful sustainable economy: the managed fishery for the giant pirarucu.",
      "In Brazil\u00b4s Amazonas state, almost 6,000 riverine dwellers authorized to fish have reported a sharp drop in production and rising costs. They are demanding aid from the federal government and debating how to adapt to climate change.",
      "Last year's catch totaled 70% of the government-authorized quota of 100,443 fish. This year could see an even steeper decline, since many communities still haven\u00b4t been able to fish. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.",
      "Pirarucu managed fishing began in the Amazon 25 years ago in the Mamiraua region and has since expanded. It helped the Amazon's largest fish escape risk of extinction and is now an important source of income for locals in 10 sustainable conservation units and eight Indigenous territories, where deforestation is close to zero.",
      "Unlike other aquatic species of the Amazon, such as river dolphins, the pirarucu \u2014 also known as arapaima \u2014 historically have proven resilient to drought and climate change. But low water levels are making it extremely difficult for fishers to transport their catch from remote lakes to major rivers and onto cities.",
      "It's a mammoth task. The pirarucu, which can weigh up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds), lives in large lakes that during flood season are often connected to major rivers. Fishing typically occurs when water levels begin to recede, making it easier to trap the fish and transport them out in small boats or canoes. In several areas, however, water levels dropped so quickly that this connection was cut off before fishing could begin.",
      "In the S\u00e3o Raimundo community in the Medio Jurua region, fishing is scheduled to start Saturday, a two-month delay \u2014 a common situation this season. As a result, Coletivo Pirarucu, an umbrella organization that represents 2,500 riverine and Indigenous families, has requested that the federal government extend fishing season until the end of January.",
      "Even in large rivers navigation has become problematic, raising costs and uncertainty among fishermen. It usually takes three to four days to transport fish from Carauari municipality \u2014 a major pirarucu producer \u2014 to Manaus, the Amazon\u00b4s largest city. During the peak of the drought, the trip increased to 10 days, and the freight price has doubled.",
      "Tough as pirarucu are, they are not immune to climate change, according to researcher Adalberto Luis Val from the National Institute for Amazonian Research. He says rising temperatures and severe droughts are exacerbating the \"death trio\" for all fish: warmer water, more CO2 and less oxygen.",
      "The pirarucu has evolved to breathe air but is far from invincible.",
      "\"No fish can regulate body temperature,\" Val said. \"Then there's water scarcity. As its level drops, you start to get a high amount of suspended material, leading to sludge buildup. It sticks to the gill area, blocking the processes that occur there.\"",
      "Fearing deteriorating conditions in the following decades, Coletivo Pirarucu contends that the fishermen should be entitled to compensation for losses caused by climate change. \"This crisis not only challenges the resilience of communities but also highlights the urgent need for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies,\" the nonprofit stated in an open letter last week.",
      "In an e-mail response, James Bessa, a federal official overseeing pirarucu management, said that Ibama, Brazil\u00b4s environmental agency, is working with other public bodies and local fishing associations to reduce the impact of extreme events like droughts and floods. He said there are plans to start scientific studies and closer monitoring to provide insights into ways to support riverine and Indigenous communities in sustaining their fishing activities.",
      "Adevaldo Dias \u2014 a riverine leader who presides over the Chico Mendes Memorial, a nonprofit that assists traditional non-Indigenous communities \u2014 argues that adopting additional public policies to help the fishermen is a matter of climate justice.",
      "\"The Indigenous and riverine peoples have minimal impact on the environment,\" Dias said. \"We know that conserving the forest benefits both us and those outside it. And when extreme climate events occur, they are the most vulnerable.\"",

      "Hawkins also said that she will continue to advocate for abortion restrictions on the federal level, but like Dannenfelser, she granted that will not be likely to happen soon.",

However, we are able to work with President Trump at this point and the first thing he must do is defund and debar Planned Parenthood.\"",
      "Also looming large behind both these groups' plans is the possibility of a Supreme Court justice retiring or passing away. Neither Dannenfelser nor Hawkins divulged who they might support for a Supreme Court nomination, but, like before, Hawkins said she expects Trump to appoint justices supporting the unborn.",
      "\"Our ask of President Trump in 2015 and 2016 will be the same ask of President Trump in 2025 or whenever that happens in this administration, that if there is a Supreme Court vacancy, no matter if it's a Sotomayor or it's a Justice Thomas, that the person that he nominates, the person that will be confirmed by the US Senate, will not be an abortion activist, they will be a constitutionalist, and they'll know what's in the Constitution and what's not in the Constitution.

      "Ever feel like navigating the internet is like walking through a digital minefield?",
      "With cybercriminals lurking around every corner, protecting your identity and finances can feel daunting. But what if I told you that a VPN could be your secret weapon?",
      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi. VPNs also prevent third parties from tracking your online activities, reducing the risk of personal data being harvested for malicious purposes.",

      "Using a VPN to reduce risks in online transactions",
      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cell phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Practical tips for using VPNs effectively",
      "1. Choose a reliable VPN provider:\u00a0Opt for reputable VPN services known for strong encryption standards and no-log policies to ensure maximum privacy and security.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "2. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Combine the use of a VPN with strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance security. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",

      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",

      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",

Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection.

But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work.

    "story": [
      "SentinelOne's chief security adviser discusses the alarming rise in cyberattacks worldwide on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",
      "You might remember the\u00a0Ascension ransomware attack from May, one of the most devastating incidents in the health care sector, causing major issues for patients.",

      "Woman working on a computer in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "1. Stay informed: Keep up to date with the latest news from your health care providers and reliable sources to stay aware of any disruptions or data breaches affecting systems and services.",
      "2. Maintain personal health records: Keep copies of your health records on your own devices or printed out, including details like medications, allergies, past surgeries and other relevant health information. This can be crucial if electronic health records become temporarily unavailable.",
      "3. Prepare for medical emergencies: Have a backup plan for emergencies, including knowing nearby alternative health care facilities. Research wait times and accessibility to help avoid delays if your primary facility is impacted.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Practice cybersecurity best practices: Use strong, unique passwords for online accounts and consider a\u00a0password manager to help manage them. Enable two-factor authentication where available to add an extra layer of security.",
      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",

      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "6) Monitor app permissions: Regularly check the\u00a0permissions granted to your apps and revoke any that seem unnecessary. This can help prevent apps from accessing more information than they need.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",

Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently.

It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",

Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",

      "Former Geary, Oklahoma, Police Department Chief Alicia Ford says the entire department resigned last month after they were refused help from city leaders.",

      "The entire Geary Police Department in Oklahoma \u2014 including Chief Alicia Ford \u2014 resigned on Oct. 31. City Council members Rocky Coleman and Kristy Miller resigned shortly afterward, as FOX 25 Oklahoma City first reported. Mayor Waylan Upchego then resigned, the Watonga Republican reported.",
      "\"The reason that prompted the entire resignation was: it was just a continued failure from the mayor to make change that would affect the department and make it more effective for the community,\" Ford told Fox News Digital. \"It was just an ongoing issue. He consistently refused to keep his word to us, and that was something that we held him to. When you're a mayor, you're [supposed] to lead the city and what's best for the city and the departments within.\"",
      "Ford said she had gone to Upchego and the city council requesting their help to address the overworked and understaffed police department, plus budget cuts that had recently impacted pay and bonuses for officers, on top of some other administrative issues. Nobody stepped up, according to the former police chief.",

      "\"They cut the jail. They cut our dispatch, and that put strain on us. But we found we went to another agency, and they have done excellent and accommodating us with that dispatch.,\" Ford explained. \"[The mayor] consistently refused to keep his word when it came to basic needs of equipment and the safety issues within our department. We talked about the budget cuts that caused hardships for these officers and myself that were unnecessary.\"",
      "Hope added that she knows that police departments across the country have dealt with staffing shortages and budget cuts, but her six-person department had recently dwindled to four, with herself doing administrative chief work, one officer stationed at the local high school, and two officers working extremely long shifts doing regular daily police work.",
      "\"Who wants to do that for extremely low pay?\"",
      "\"So that would lead two officers to do basically 24 hours . . . five to seven days a week. That's not realistic,\" she said. \"But honestly, who wants to do that for extremely low pay? I mean, they did it. And honestly, I don't ever really remember these two officers complaining about it.\"",

I've taken several roles in law enforcement, but never that type of administrative, high . . . role,\" she explained. \"It was great. . . . Geary, Oklahoma, was an amazing community. They were very accepting of me.\"",

      "\"I have tried to be a voice of reason. Unfortunately, I was just one voice. The City Council and administration should not allow personal goals or agendas to affect the city. Decisions should be made only to benefit the city,\" he wrote, adding that council members lacked communication and were frequently left in the dark about agenda items.",
      "\"Transparency is also crucial for communication. I would love to see more communication online, not just in person. For example, the financial reports should be posted for the community to read. I have never shied away from explaining the state of the finances to any citizen who has asked. When people are informed, they are more likely to understand that we have a failing infrastructure and why rate increases must happen. I have repeatedly asked that we be more proactive instead of reactive. We should be prepared for the worst and not hoping for the best.\"",

Was it reasonable for him to think that, given the circumstances, given the fact that he said, 'I don't care if I'm going to jail, I don't care. I'm going to kill myself. I don't care if I die,' would a reasonable person be in fear at that time? Or would a reasonable person have let him go?\""

      "A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",

      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \"It may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\" Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",

      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",

      "Currently, both chambers of Congress enter \"pro forma\" sessions, even when the House and the Senate are out of town, as a tactic to block the president from bypassing confirmation votes.",
      "The Supreme Court rebuked President Barack Obama when\u00a0he\u00a0made recess appointments, ruling 9-0 that he made them during a three-day break and that recesses are technically longer than that. The ruling gave the Senate more power to thwart such appointments in the future.",
      "In 2020, during the throes of the Covid pandemic, Trump threatened to unilaterally adjourn Congress so he could make recess appointments, but the threat never materialized.",
      "Trump's post Sunday is his first time he has weighed into the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Republicans' de facto leader in the Senate.",
      "GOP Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida and John Thune of South Dakota, the minority whip, are running to replace him.",
      "Scott quickly weighed Sunday, writing on X that he agrees with Trump about recess appointments.",
      "\"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,\" Scott wrote.",

      "\u201cThe Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cArticle II, Section 2, Clause 3: The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d",
      "Thune said members of the Senate must act \"quickly and decisively\" on Trump appointments.",
      "\u201cWe must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s nominees in place as soon as possible, & all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Schumer and Senate Dems block the will of the American people,\" he wrote on X.",
      "The race to succeed McConnell has heated up since Election Day, with rank-and-file GOP senators publicly endorsing their picks.",
      "Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee have all endorsed Scott.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has endorsed Cornyn.",
      "On Thursday, Thune urged Trump not to endorse in the race, telling CNBC in an interview, \u201cObviously, if he wants to, he could exert a considerable amount of influence on that, but honestly, I think my preference would be, and I think it\u2019s probably in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "Scott told Trump in May that he would run to succeed McConnell and asked for his endorsement, a source familiar with the call told NBC News.",
      "Cornyn, Scott and Thune will meet Tuesday evening at a candidates forum organized by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. On Wednesday morning, just hours before Trump meets with President Joe Biden at the White House, senators will vote for a new majority leader by secret ballot.",
      "In the second part of his Truth Social post Sunday, Trump called on Democrats not to confirm any additional judicial nominees before the start of the next congressional session.",
      "\"Additionally, no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over\u00a0Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU!\" Trump wrote, suggesting Republicans should stop Democrats from confirming judges during the lame duck session.",
      "That would work only if Republicans slow-walk the process. They cannot unilaterally stop Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., from putting nominees on the floor."

    "summary": "NBC News hasn't yet called the Senate race in Pennsylvania, where Republican Dave McCormick holds a narrow lead over Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.",
    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania's hotly contested Senate race hangs in the balance nearly a week after Election Day, with Republicans declaring victory and Democrats holding out hope that the remaining batch of outstanding ballots will allow them to close the gap.",
      "NBC News has yet to project a winner in the contest between Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick, who are separated by just over 40,000 votes with 98% of the expected vote in. An estimated 122,000 ballots have yet to be tallied.",
      "McCormick declared victory Thursday after The Associated Press called the race in his favor. Since then, he and his GOP allies in Washington have ramped up the pressure on Casey to concede, arguing he has no path to victory.",
      "\"The AP called this race a number of days ago because mathematically, there's no path for Sen. Casey to win,\" McCormick said in a Fox News interview Sunday.",
      "\"Ultimately, Sen. Casey's going to have to decide when he's ready to acknowledge that,\" he added.",
      "The Casey campaign has argued the remaining number of expected provisional ballots, particularly from places like Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, could tilt the scales in its favor.",
      "Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for Casey, who is in his third term, said in a statement Saturday that every day counties \"are confirming there are more ballots that need to be counted.\"",
      "\"Pennsylvanians deserve to have their voices heard, and as state officials have made clear, counties across Pennsylvania need more time to tabulate remaining votes,\" she said.",
      "A McCormick victory would further pad Republicans' newfound majority in the Senate, where they will hold at least 52 seats after the election. The size of the majority could play an important role in how much of President-elect Donald Trump's agenda will pass and how many of his nominees will get confirmed.",
      "But even before the new Congress is sworn in next January, the outcome of the Pennsylvania race could have implications for the Senate leadership elections Wednesday.",
      "Three Republicans are vying to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the party's leader, and senators-elect can participate in the vote.",
      "Without a clear winner yet in Pennsylvania, though, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is waiting to invite either McCormick or Casey to Congress this week for orientation and Wednesday's vote \u2014 a move that has angered Republicans.",
      "Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who is running to be the GOP leader, said on X that \u201cthe idea that Schumer would not allow him to participate in Senate orientation is beyond unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called Schumer's move to hold off on inviting McCormick a \"shameful, election-denying decision\" in a post on X.",
      "A Schumer spokesperson defended the decision, pointing to the number of ballots that have yet to be counted in Pennsylvania.",
      "\"With over 100,000 ballots left to be counted in Pennsylvania, the race has not been decided,\" spokesperson Alex Nguyen said. \"As is custom, we will invite the winner once the votes are counted.\"",
      "Similarly, Arizona Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego was also not invited to the orientation as his race against Republican Kari Lake is too close to call, according to an NBC News projection. He leads by 2 percentage points with 91% of the expected vote in.",
      "Provisional ballots were a contentious issue in Pennsylvania even before Election Day. Pennsylvanians can cast provisional ballots when officials are unclear about their eligibility or there were issues with their returned mail-in ballots. In the days after an election, officials work to determine whether such voters are eligible to cast ballots, and if they are, their votes will be counted.",
      "In the days before Election Day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow Pennsylvania voters who sent mail ballots that were flagged as potentially defective to submit separate provisional in-person ballots, rejecting a lawsuit from Republicans.",
      "McCormick\u2019s campaign filed\u00a0two lawsuits\u00a0Friday challenging an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 provisional ballots in Philadelphia that may have issues, such as missing signatures. Philadelphia is a deep-blue area, and the results in the county so far have leaned heavily in Casey\u2019s favor.",
      "The court dismissed the issue for the time being.",
      "As of Sunday, the Casey campaign was still expressing optimism about overcoming its vote deficit, pointing to the roughly 76% of provisional ballots that favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz in 2022.",
      "\"We don\u2019t believe we need to reach Fetterman\u2019s percent breakdown in order to win. What\u2019s more, there are thousands of ballots that are supportive of Casey that are being cured,\" said a person close to the Casey campaign, referring to the processing of addressing minor mistakes on mail ballots, such as signature issues.",
      "At the presidential level, NBC News projected that Trump won Pennsylvania. He leads Vice President Kamala Harris by about 2 percentage points."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Olivia Troye, a former Trump administration official who denounced him in a speech at the Democratic convention in August, was boarding a plane recently when a passenger looked at her and said: \u201cYour days are numbered.\u201d",
      "Not wanting to escalate a bad situation, she said nothing, but the troubling encounter is emblematic of the hostility she\u2019s faced as a recognizable and vocal critic of Trump. Now, with Trump returning to the White House, she is beset by newfound fears that he, his appointees or supporters could try to punish her for speaking out.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll be targeted by him and a lot of people in his circle,\u201d Troye said in an interview. \u201cThey very much know who I am. And I\u2019m concerned for my family.\u201d",
      "She has plenty of company. For some who\u2019ve run afoul of Trump, the election results have sparked fresh worries that he may enter office looking for retribution.",
      "He\u2019s been out of power for nearly four years, airing grievances over how he believes he\u2019s been mistreated by law enforcement, but on Jan. 20 he\u2019ll be sworn in with a panoply of governmental powers at his disposal. He\u2019s made no secret of who he believes has wronged him, and as president, he could upend their lives through investigations, tax audits or courts-martial if he chose.",
      "During the campaign, Trump has made different statements about whether he might target people who\u2019ve upset him. What he\u2019s said can be construed in different ways. He gave a speech last year hours after he was charged with mishandling classified documents and said that if elected, he would \u201cappoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the United States of America: Joe Biden and the entire Biden crime family.\u201d",
      "In February, he dismissed any concerns that he might want vengeance, saying: \u201cMy revenge will be success.\u201d",
      "He told Fox News last month in an exchange about weaponizing government against political foes: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. That\u2019s a bad thing for the country. I don\u2019t want to do that. I haven\u2019t said that I would. But they have done it.\u201d",
      "In the same interview, he described Democratic Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, both of California, as the \u201cenemy from within.\u201d",
      "As for Jack Smith, the special prosecutor who has been investigating Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents and his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, Trump said last month he should be \u201cthrown out of the country.\u201d (A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment).",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally in Congress, said he doesn\u2019t expect any of the prosecutors to face reprisals over Trump investigations.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of that\u2019s going to happen because we\u2019re the party who\u2019s against political prosecution,\u201d Jordan said Sunday on CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re the party who\u2019s against going after your opponents using lawfare.\u201d",
      "None of this has a precise parallel in the modern era. President Richard Nixon had his enemies, but tended to rail against them in private.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is, the Post is going to have damnable, damnable problems out of this one,\u201d Nixon told his aides in 1972, complaining about The Washington Post\u2019s coverage. \u201cWell, the game has to be played awfully rough.\u201d",
      "Interviews with 10 people \u2014 those who worked in the first Trump administration, lawmakers and critics, among others \u2014 reveal varying levels of distress.",
      "A private attorney, Mark Zaid, said he has consulted with clients about how they can best protect themselves in a second Trump administration. He said he has advised some to leave the country before Trump is sworn in and live abroad until they have a clear sense of whether he is bent on retaliation.",

They had transferred Cohen from home detention to prison, a move that was \u201cretaliatory in response to Cohen desiring to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book critical of the President [Trump] and to discuss the book on social media,\u201d Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote. He ordered Cohen returned to confinement in his Manhattan apartment.",
      "Security clearances can be important to people who\u2019ve moved to the private sector, and if the Trump administration were to yank them, he could deprive them of their livelihoods.",
      "Incoming Vice President JD Vance suggested last month that the Trump administration would pull the security clearances of the 51 people with national security experience who signed a letter before the 2020 election questioning the authenticity of emails found on a laptop belonging to Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.",
      "Vance told podcaster Joe Rogan that \u201cthey still all have security clearances, I believe, which is going to change when we win.\u201d",
      "Larry Pfeiffer, former chief of staff at the CIA who co-signed the letter, said: \u201cThere are colleagues of mine on that list who have clearances because they\u2019re active members of companies that do business inside the intelligence community, and they will likely lose their post-government livelihoods if their clearances are pulled.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be, in our view, absolutely unprecedented to pull peoples\u2019 clearances for some opinion that they espouse,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump will assume office with a mandate from voters and minimal restraints. Republicans will take control of the Senate and are better positioned than Democrats to run the House given the election results that are still coming in, lifting a potential check on executive power.",
      "Separately, a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year imbued the president with sweeping immunity, removing a deterrent to possible retaliatory action.",
      "Because Trump is limited to one term, public opinion won\u2019t be the brake that it has been for presidents facing re-election.",
      "Though Trump has at times offered assurances that he wouldn\u2019t try to avenge the wrongs he says he\u2019s suffered, some of his critics aren\u2019t convinced he means it.",
      "A Fox News host asked him last month if he would \u201cdo to them what they did to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people say that\u2019s what should happen if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked if he would \u201clook at his political enemies\u201d when back in office, Trump said: \u201cNo, I want to make this the most successful country in the world. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d",
      "Schiff\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. After Trump referred to him as an \u201cenemy\u201d living inside the country, Schiff posted on social media that \u201cthere is no justification for such dictatorial behavior. Except dictatorial ambition.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Pelosi pointed to her comments in a Los Angeles Times article before the election, in which she said that if Trump were to win, \u201cnot just us, but many other people would be targeted.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anyone begins to truly use the criminal justice system or other aspects of the government to target their enemies, then we are nothing but a banana republic,\u201d said Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who before entering office was the lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment case. \u201cThe response you\u2019ll get from Republicans is, \u2018That\u2019s what Joe Biden did.\u2019 And I would ask any right-thinking person to actually say that Joe Biden weaponized the Department of Justice when his Department of Justice convicted his own son.\u201d",
      "Not wanting to call attention to themselves or antagonize Trump, some who\u2019ve been publicly critical in the past are staying silent for now.",
      "One former Trump White House official who has publicly spoken against Trump described feeling \u201cscared\u201d and declined to let their name be used.",
      "Another ex-Trump administration official who has publicly derided Trump said that while they\u2019re remaining in the U.S., others are \u201cconferring with counsel and trying to figure things out like what are the immigration laws and policies in places they might consider going.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unreal,\u201d this person added. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal that in this day and age in this country, we\u2019re having these thoughts and concerns.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just Trump and his circle that frighten those who\u2019ve spoken out; it\u2019s also his following. Two days after the election, someone wrote in reply to one of Troye\u2019s posts on X: \u201cYou too should prepare for prison. Trump owns your pathetic ass.\u201d",
      "Michael Fanone, the former D.C. police officer who was attacked on Jan. 6 and became a vocal critic of Trump since that time, called him an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d earlier this year. Hours later, his 78-year-old mother was \u201cswatted,\u201d with a SWAT team showing up at her home while she was in her nightgown because of a false report.",

      "Zaid represented a whistleblower in Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial and has also defended some of the 51 people who co-signed the Hunter Biden letter. In 2019, Trump called him a \u201csleazeball,\u201d citing some anti-Trump tweets he had posted two years earlier.",
      "He, too, is uneasy about what\u2019s to come.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned that the new White House will make it difficult for us to represent federal employees fairly \u2014 (meaning) that they would not retaliate against our clients,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if they wanted, they can make our lives difficult and interfere with anyone\u2019s law practice, just by saying they\u2019re not going to respond to things we do.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "If Trump or his political appointees were to pursue legal retribution, career prosecutors may not find it easy to bring such cases, nor might they be willing to go along.",
      "John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, who wrote a book disparaging Trump\u2019s methods, said in an interview: \u201cI assume there\u2019s a long retribution list and I\u2019m on it.\u201d",
      "He sketched out what might happen if, hypothetically, Trump ordered the Justice Department to open an investigation into a political foe that had no legal basis.",
      "Eventually, the request would fall from political appointees to career Justice Department prosecutors. What these lawyers choose to do is \u201cwhen the rubber meets the road,\u201d said Bolton, a former Justice Department official in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cDoes the career prosecutor say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do that\u2019? Do they fire him? Does he resign? When does that become public? Fifteen seconds later is the answer to that. And then we have a crisis.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s appointments may offer the earliest clues as to how he\u2019ll use the government\u2019s vast powers. Will he fill posts with loyalists who want only to please him and indulge his instincts, or will he pick people for whom the rule of law remains a guidepost?",
      "At least one Democrat was heartened by Trump\u2019s selection of Susie Wiles, daughter of the late NFL football announcer Pat Summerall, as his White House chief of staff.",
      "\u201cShe is brilliant, tough, strategic,\u201d Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., wrote on X. \u201cShe will serve the country well.\u201d",
      "For now, others who may have reason to fear Trump\u2019s return are watching and waiting to see what happens.",
      "Aquilino Gonell, a former U.S. Capitol police sergeant who was assaulted by Trump supporters on Jan. 6 and who later testified before the House committee investigating the riot, said: \u201cYes, I have to be vigilant. I mean, I have a family to take care of.\u201d",
      "Gonell sustained injuries in the Jan. 6 attack that forced him to retire in 2022. He campaigned for Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race and has been vocal about what he sees as Trump\u2019s failings as his supporters flooded the Capitol that day and interfered with the transfer of power.",

      "Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., on Sunday dodged when asked if President-elect Donald Trump should seek to preserve the Department of Justice\u2019s independence from the White House, telling moderator Kristen Welker that former President John F. Kennedy previously appointed his brother Robert F. Kennedy as attorney general and that Trump can \u201cchoose who he wants.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that John Kennedy appointed his brother, little brother Bobby, as attorney general. The president gets to choose who he wants,\u201d Barrasso told Kristen Welker, the moderator of NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have hearings on whoever the president appoints as the attorney general of the United States. And I\u2019m looking forward to those discussions and those hearings,\u201d Barrasso added. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to moving quickly with the majority we have in the Senate to get the president\u2019s Cabinet in place so he can hit the ground running come Jan. 20.\u201d",
      "His answer comes just days after Trump was projected to take back the White House, cementing Republican control of the presidency and the Senate.",
      "Since the 1970s Watergate scandal, presidential administrations have typically sought to give the Justice Department relative independence from the White House, even though the attorney general is a political appointee.",
      "Barrasso also spoke about Trump\u2019s agenda, which prioritizes a massive plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the U.S.",
      "On Thursday, Trump told NBC News in a phone call that \u201cthere is no price tag\u201d when it comes to executing his plan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not \u2014 really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here. There is no price tag,\u201d the president-elect told Welker.",
      "On Sunday, Barrasso dodged questions about whether there should be limits to how much Trump can spend on his deportation plan.",
      "\u201cI agree there\u2019s no price tag on protecting the safety and security of our country and our citizens. President Trump is going to enforce the law, and we haven\u2019t had that over the last four years,\u201d the senator said in response to a question about whether he agrees that there should be \u201cno price tag\u201d to Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "Barrasso added that Trump\u2019s deportation plan is part of what led to his successful presidential run, telling Welker, \u201cIf you take a look ...  the number of people that support deporting these individuals, it is a supermajority of Americans, and I believe it had a lot to do with the president\u2019s success, his overwhelming success at the polls last Tuesday.\u201d",
      "Pressed further about the price tag for this plan, which could be in the billions of dollars, Barrasso continued to push Trump\u2019s plan without directly answering the question, saying, \u201cI agree with the president on where we need to start. We need to start with the people who are felons, who have left in this, been left in this country, people who are on the terrorist watch list, people who have been convicted in other countries of murder and rape, people who are calling crimes in this country, that\u2019s the place to start. And that\u2019s where President Trump is about to start.\u201d",
      "Barrasso, who is a physician specializing in orthopedics, also dodged questions about whether he\u2019d support Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an infamous vaccine and fluoride skeptic, serving in the Trump White House.",
      "\u201cWell, since President Trump hasn\u2019t actually made any nominations yet along those lines, I\u2019m not going to comment on any one individual,\u201d the senator said.",
      "In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Kennedy, who has a long history of spreading proven falsehoods about vaccines, said he was in line to play a leadership role on health care in the next Trump administration, something that Trump did not deny.",
      "Ahead of the election, Trump said Kennedy would have a \u201cbig role in the administration\u201d if the election went his way and added that he would be open to some of Kennedy\u2019s more controversial ideas, like banning certain vaccines or taking fluoride out of the U.S. water system.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very talented guy and has strong views,\u201d Trump said at the time, adding at a campaign event that week that Kennedy \u201ccan do anything he wants.\u201d",
      "After the election, Kennedy told NBC News that he wouldn\u2019t \u201ctake away anybody\u2019s vaccines,\u201d adding, \u201cif\u00a0vaccines\u00a0are working for somebody, I\u2019m not going to take them away. People ought to have choice.\u201d"

      "Russia has massed \u201ctens of thousands of troops\u201d as part of a major effort to retake land in its Kursk region that was seized by Ukraine, according to the Commander-in-Chief of Kyiv's armed forces.",
      "Oleksandr\u00a0Syrskyi said Monday that Russian forces were \"trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control\" in Kursk, where Ukraine's military has occupied swathes of territory since a surprise August incursion that turned the tables in the two-and-a-half-year war.",
      "The push to retake territory comes as the two sides exchanged an intense wave of drone attacks that Ukraine said killed eight people, and after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, which could upend the U.S. approach to the war. The Kremlin on Monday denied that Trump had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Ukraine and its allies have warned a counteroffensive in Kursk was likely for weeks, and said that thousands of North Korean troops were among the force assembled by the Kremlin in Kursk.",
      "\u201cThe importance of this operational area cannot be underestimated given the number of enemy troops concentrated there,\u201d Syrskyi said in a post on Telegram, adding that soldiers were engaged in combat in the area. \"If it were not for the steadfastness of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian assault units would have stormed our positions\" elsewhere on the front lines, he said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed in September that Ukraine had seized roughly 500 square miles of Russian territory, but their offensive has stalled in recent months after Putin promised to \"squeeze\" Ukrainian troops out of the country.",
      "Russia had initially struggled to respond, and there seemed to be limited resources devoted to driving back the first invasion of Russian land since World War II.",
      "But Zelenskyy said last week that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers in the areas bordering Ukraine and were taking part in \u201ccombat against Ukrainian militaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are losses; this is a fact,\u201d he said",
      "The Pentagon had confirmed earlier that\u00a0some 10,000 North Korean troops\u00a0had been sent to Russia for training and were presumed to be joining the fight against Ukraine, intensifying their partnership and alarming the United States and its allies.",
      "As Russia continues its offensive, Ukraine is also reckoning with a shifting political landscape as its biggest backer elects a new president.",
      "Trump has said he would be able to resolve Russia\u2019s invasion before he even takes office, and has praised Putin while blaming\u00a0Zelenskyy for the war.",
      "Tech mogul\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0briefly joined Trump\u2018s call with Zelenskyy last Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. Zelenskyy described the call as \"excellent.\"",
      "However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday denied a Washington Post report, citing multiple unnamed sources, that Trump had spoken with Putin.",
      "\"There was no conversation,\u201d Peskov claimed. \"It is completely untrue. It is pure fiction, it is simply false information.\"",
      "Russia's push in Kursk marks the latest escalation in fighting after the two countries exchanged a wave of drone strikes over the weekend.",
      "Ukraine said heavy Russian shelling from Sunday through to Monday morning killed eight civilians in the country, including five in the city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine's Kherson, Donestsk and Sumy regions also experienced causalities, according to local officials.",
      "The strikes come after Ukraine launched its largest drone attack on the\u00a0Russian capital, Moscow,\u00a0since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion began in 2022, injuring one person and forcing three major airports to divert flights.",
      "Russia fired an unprecedented 145 drones against Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian officials said that at least two people were injured and buildings were damaged by Russian drone strikes on the\u00a0southern region of Odesa. Zelenskyy said Monday that Ukraine has suffered $800 billion in damages as a result of Russian aggression."

    "story": [
      "Jake Bates hit a 52-yard field goal as time expired Sunday to help the Detroit Lions beat the Houston Texans 26-23 for their seventh straight win.",
      "The Lions scored the final 19 points of the game after having trailed 23-7 at halftime. Detroit overcame a chaotic performance by quarterback Jared Goff, who threw five interceptions in the win. Goff is just the third quarterback since 1990 to win a game while throwing five interceptions.",
      "C.J. Stroud threw two interceptions of his own for the Texans, and he was also sacked four times.",
      "Goff was picked off on the Lions\u2019 first drive, and Houston responded by scoring a touchdown eight plays later. After a Detroit three-and-out, the Texans added to their lead with a field goal.",
      "The Lions briefly appeared to settle down offensively with an 11-play, 70-yard drive to cut the score to 10-7. But their final four drives of the first half were an interception, a three-and-out, a three-and-out and then one more interception on a Hail Mary attempt.",
      "In that time, Houston added two more field goals and a touchdown. The Texans\u2019 final touchdown was a 15-yard reception by John Metchie, his first career score.",
      "The second half started with the quarterbacks trading interceptions. After a Houston punt, Detroit finally worked down the field for a touchdown to cut the score to 23-13. But then the game ground to a halt. The quarterbacks traded interceptions for a second time before the offenses combined for three straight punts.",
      "The Lions finally restored order with a seven-play, 64-yard drive for a touchdown to make the score 23-20. After another seven-play drive by Detroit to tie the game, Houston had a chance to win late.

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 13:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "More states are looking to ban phones during class.",
    "story": [
      "More than 200,000 students at one of the largest school districts in the nation have started the school year with a major change: no cellphone use allowed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve noticed such a big difference in the classroom. Students talk more. They actually do their work,\u201d Dominique Mayorga, a teacher who installed a sleeve in her classroom that can hold around 30 phones, said.",
      "Over the summer, Florida\u2019s Broward County Public Schools made the decision to ban students from using cellphones and other communication devices for the entire school day. Students are to keep phones off or in airplane mode the entire day and relinquish them to designated areas, like Mayorga's sleeve, during class, or face disciplinary action. The new policy, which went into effect in August, quickly sparked debate among parents, students, teachers and administrators.",
      "Critics of the ban have raised safety concerns, arguing it could hamper communication during an emergency. It's a particularly sensitive topic in Broward County after the 2018 Parkland shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which is in the district.",
      "Response to the ban was quick. Parents flooded the comments of posts the district made on X and Instagram announcing the changes, circulating a change.org petition asking for the school to reverse the ban. It has garnered over 25,000 signatures.",
      "Carline Dumoulin, a mother of two students at Broward\u2019s Cypress Bay High School, is one of those signatories. Cellphones, she said, are \u201cthe way for us to communicate if there\u2019s any type of problems going on at school, and I don\u2019t need to go into the details \u2014 we know what\u2019s happened before.\u201d",
      "Students \u201cneed to be able to communicate with the outside world, with their parents or their guardians, to let them know that there\u2019s a problem,\u201d Dumoulin added.",
      "For many at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, cellphones were an important resource during the shooting. Some students used their devices to text loved ones, post live updates or even take pictures and videos, some of which would later be shown at the gunman\u2019s trial, where he was sentenced to life in prison for killing 17 students and faculty at the school.",
      "Broward County school board member Lori Alhadeff said she understands parents\u2019 safety concerns all too well: She lost her 14-year-old daughter Alyssa in the Parkland shooting.",
      "But Alhadeff supports the ban, explaining that emergency protocols are in place to help alleviate those concerns. In schoolwide emergencies, for example, district policy says students will be able to access their devices from the place that their teacher has designated.",
      "\u201cOn Feb. 14 [of 2018], all I wanted to do was hear from Alyssa. I texted Alyssa during that day, told Alyssa to run and hide, that help was on the way,\u201d Alhadeff said. \u201cI know it\u2019s scary, but we have and will communicate with parents as soon as possible to let them know that their kids are safe.\u201d",
      "But Alhadeff said she\u2019s open to adjusting the rules as time goes on. \u201cI talked to students. I heard them loud and clear that they would like to use their phone during lunch and transition times and study halls,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m absolutely open to the conversation.\u201d",
      "A full ban",
      "The cellphone ban was put in place to adhere to a new law signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in May 2023. The law restricts the use of all wireless communication devices in public school classrooms, saying that they must be powered off during instructional time and placed in an area designated by the teacher.",
      "Florida\u2019s law is one of the first of its kind to go into effect in the U.S., but similar legislation has spread across the country, with at least 15 states including Indiana and Ohio adopting similar policies against cellphone use in public school classrooms. The most recent state to adopt restrictions was California, passing its Phone-Free Schools Act on Sept. 23.",
      "Broward County took the Florida bill a step further and banned the use of devices for the entire school day.",
      "Broward County school board member Debra Hixon was present at the meeting where the rule was approved, but had left before the vote. She said she would have voted against it because it should have allowed students to use their phones during lunch, as it is \u201ctheir time.\u201d",
      "But during her time at the meeting, Hixon said, the board agreed to allow students to leave their phones on airplane mode so they could have quick access in case of emergency. Hixon, who lost her husband, Chris, in the Parkland shooting, said complaints and concerns have \u201creally leveled off\u201d and that parents understand cellphones will be easily accessible to students when needed.",
      "On its website, Broward County nods to some concerns that inspired the legislation, including cyberbullying. Last year, a video of several students fighting at West Broward High School circulated online, gaining thousands of views on X. Following the fight, the school\u2019s principal sent a message to parents warning that \u201cstudents who videotape\u201d fights were also at risk of disciplinary action.",
      "Board member Allen Zeman is a strong proponent of maintaining the cellphone ban for the entire day. He emphasized the negative impact cellphones can have on students, including how they\u2019ve worsened mental health and caused distractions.",
      "\u201cIf nobody has social media, if nobody has an ability to \u2018like you\u2019 or to do any kind of action, or to share something with you that everyone else has seen, so you have to see it too, your day is better,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cYou can breathe. You can take a little longer to enjoy a lecture or to sit on the grass and enjoy your lunch, rather than be buried in your cellphone. That\u2019s why Broward County did it from bell to bell, and it\u2019s why it\u2019s important that it\u2019s enforced for everybody.\u201d",
      "Zeman also emphasized the alarming decrease in literacy rates in public schools. A report by the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that reading test scores have been declining since 1992.",
      "Max Schachter, who lost his son Alex in the Parkland shooting and has since become an advocate for safe schools, also said he is in full support of the cellphone restrictions and believes that the safety protocols will protect students even when they are without their devices. He added that in emergency situations, students should focus on following safety procedures, not be on their phones.",
      "\u201cDuring an emergency, kids should not be contacting their parents. Parents are not going to be able to do anything to help their children anyway,\u201d Schachter said.",
      "The state has also taken steps to address school safety. Following the 2018 shooting, Florida passed school safety legislation creating Alyssa\u2019s Alert, which requires schools to install a mobile alert system that will call the authorities in an emergency, as well as the Marjory Stone Douglas High School Public Safety Act, which increased school security personnel and surveillance in public schools. The district has also invested over $2 million in installing metal detectors in its schools.",
      "Classrooms and hallways",
      "Keeping students off their phones when outside of classrooms has proven hard to enforce.",
      "Two teachers and a student who spoke to NBC News said that inside the classroom, the rules have been in full force, but passing periods and lunch are where things get murky. A spokesperson said the district has been collecting survey data that will be reviewed in November to assess how the ban has been going.",
      "Leo Jimenez, a science teacher at Cooper City High School, said enforcement during class has been going well and that he has seen improvement in his students\u2019 focus during class time. He already had rules regarding cellphone use in his classroom before the ban, he added, and the district rule has helped back him up.",
      "However, during lunch and passing periods, Jimenez said, it\u2019s been rare to see enforcement, and he doesn\u2019t believe many other schools have been enforcing it during those times either.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a battle that I don\u2019t think anybody wants to fight.\u201d Jimenez said.",
      "Board member Hixon said that she has been hearing similar things about enforcement of the rules.",
      "\u201cIn the hallways, they\u2019re using it, and they\u2019re just not really doing it to the fidelity of the law,\u201d Hixon said. \u201cAgain, my concern [is] with the lunchtime restriction, because who\u2019s supposed to be monitoring and enforcing that?\u201d",
      "However, board member Zeman has been hearing different feedback.",
      "\u201cThe enforcement has been no issue in Broward County Schools,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cWhere we want to enforce the rules, we do a very good job of it, as do most school districts across the country.\u201d",
      "The solution that many teachers have found to get students off their phones during class are cellphone pocket sleeves. Jimenez said he has installed a sleeve in his classroom, like Mayorga.",
      "Marlena, a sophomore at South Broward High School, said she\u2019s seen virtually no enforcement of the rules during lunch and passing periods.",
      "\u201cIf they did enforce it during their lunch and passing period, I wouldn\u2019t want that,\u201d Marlena said.",
      "Room for improvement",
      "Mayorga, the art teacher, said she believes there\u2019s still room for improvement in enforcing the new rules, pointing to Orange County Public Schools, another school district in Florida that has implemented a similar policy to Broward\u2019s. Mayorga said having resources such as additional school personnel to enforce the ban during lunch and passing periods, as she said Orange County has done, could help its efficacy. A Broward County Public Schools spokesperson said a variety of staff members \u2014 including administrators, security personnel and teachers \u2014 are tasked with supervising the use of cellphones in the hallways and in lunchrooms, but the number of staff assigned to the role is determined by each school.",
      "In Broward County, the conversation around the ban is set to continue. A district spokesperson said the board would be discussing the survey results and feedback on the ban.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we need to make sure that the end user, which is our students, that they\u2019re happy and that the policy is being followed with fidelity,\u201d Alhadeff said. \u201cI think it is a very difficult thing to have teachers constantly be phone watchdogs, and so I do believe that the board is open to some solutions that might make everybody happy.\u201d"

      "An additional 24 monkeys believed to be among 43 that escaped a South Carolina research facility last week have been recovered, and eyes are on a \"sizable group\" nearby, police said Sunday.",
      "Sunday's capture comes a day after the recovery of one of the Rhesus macaques that escaped the Alpha Genesis Primate Research Center in the town of Yemassee, South Carolina.",
      "Veterinarians have examined the 25 and concluded they were unharmed, the Yemassee Police Department said in its latest statement.",
      "\"Initial reports from the veterinary team indicate that all recovered animals are in good health,\" the department said.",
      "At least some of the rest of the 18 escapees were believed to be along a fence line around the facility, police said. The primates in that group have \"bedded down in the trees for the night,\" police said.",
      "Police cited Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard\u00a0for confirming recovery of the 24 on Sunday.",

      "Authorities urged residents near the facility to keep windows and doors secured while the search for the remaining primates remained active.",

      "\"We thank the public for their cooperation,\" police said.",

    "title": "More women seek testosterone therapy, prompted by influencers, doctors say",
    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 13:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "On a Reddit community for users to discuss menopause, there are countless posts of women suggesting the drug could help improve energy and sex drive.",
    "story": [
      "Do women have a testosterone problem?",
      "Social media influencers believe they do. And with the rise of telemedicine and testosterone replacement clinics opening up across the country, access to the drug has never been easier.",
      "In the U.S., prescriptions for testosterone increased nearly 50% between 2013 and 2023, according to recent data from the health technology company IQVIA. Doctors say interest in the hormone isn\u2019t being driven only by men, but also by women in their 40s and 50s.",
      "\u201cIt feels almost like an epidemic,\u201d Dr. Rebecca Dunsmoor-Su, chief medical officer for Gennev, a national telemedicine company for menopause patients, said about middle-age women seeking testosterone.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re being told this is the miracle-drug pill that they\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d",
      "Because patients are often prescribed testosterone gels, pellets or pills through med-spas and telemedicine, there could be even more women taking the hormone than realized, Dunsmoor-Su said.",
      "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and plays a variety of roles in the human body. In men, testosterone boosts muscle mass, sex drive and deepening of the voice. In women, who also have testosterone generally in much lower levels, it also plays a role in libido, muscular health and energy.",
      "Typically, testosterone levels in men are around 15 times higher than in women.",
      "In both women and men, it\u2019s normal for testosterone levels to drop with age \u2014 starting at about age 30 in men and around 40 in women. The decline doesn\u2019t mean that it necessarily needs to be replaced, either for health or longevity.",
      "Levels for what is considered normal can vary depending on the lab, and just because levels are low, that does not necessarily mean testosterone should be started. Doctors use a combination of symptoms and blood work in deciding whom to treat.",
      "If a patient does have symptoms of \u201clow T\u201d \u2014 including depression, lethargy and low sex drive \u2014 doctors typically gauge levels with a blood test before deciding treatment.",
      "Testosterone treatment includes a gel rubbed on the shoulder, pills or an implantable pellet in the buttocks.",
      "Why do women use testosterone?",
      "Dr. Amy Voedisch, an OB-GYN at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California, has noticed a dramatic rise in recent years in middle-age women asking for testosterone therapy.",
      "Perimenopausal symptoms begin when women reach their 40s, triggered by hormonal fluctuations and accompanied by irregular periods, brain fog, insomnia and hair loss. The changes typically begin a few years before menopause, when periods permanently end.",
      "Some women may notice a decrease in sex drive as levels of estrogen and testosterone, both of which play a role in libido, start to decline as they get older.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll talk about menopausal hormone therapy and then they\u2019ll say \u2014 but what about testosterone?\u201d",
      "Topical testosterone products first hit the market in the early 2000s.",
      "Voedisch, who has been in practice for decades, says the phenomenon among women really started to take off just in the last couple of years. Previously, interest in testosterone therapy rarely came up in appointments, she said.",
      "Now, virtually every new menopause patient she sees will ask about it.",
      "A patient will say, \u201cI was listening to this podcast, and they said that I needed this,\u201d she said. \u201cOr I have this Instagram person that I follow and she said that I absolutely have to be on it.\u201d",
      "On the Reddit community r/menopause, scores of posts tout the drug\u2019s benefits of improved energy and sex drive for women.",
      "Few of the claims are supported by evidence, Dunsmoor-Su said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll give them energy, it\u2019ll make them thin, it will make them horny, like they\u2019ve been promised,\u201d she said, describing common claims about the drug. \u201cIt does everything \u2014 and all of their problems are just because they\u2019re a little low in testosterone.\u201d",
      "Dr. Traci Kurtzer, a menopause specialist at the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause in Chicago, agreed the push for testosterone started happening in recent years. Her patients inquire about testosterone therapy for multiple problems \u2014 to improve mood, energy, sex drive, brain fog and muscle mass.",
      "She tells patients that testosterone therapy is currently only recommended for a low sex drive, although future research may find other benefits.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, that\u2019ll be wonderful, but at this point in time we don\u2019t have the data to support that,\u201d Kurtzer said.",
      "Does testosterone help women?",
      "The Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved testosterone therapy for women. However, doctors can prescribe it for low sex drive after other causes, including medical and psychological ones, are ruled out, said Dr. Jan Shifren, director of Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Midlife Women\u2019s Health Center in Boston.",
      "Shifren, who has been involved in clinical trials looking at testosterone therapy in women, said that the benefits for women with low libido aren\u2019t terribly impressive.",
      "\u201cWomen who are randomized to testosterone, compared with placebo, have one additional satisfying sexual event in four weeks, compared with placebo,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to declining hormonal levels, causes of low libido in women can include relationship problems, anxiety or depression, and metabolic conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Discomfort from vaginal dryness from menopause is another reason. Exhaustion from caregiving and other family responsibilities also take their toll, doctors say.",
      "Shifren urges women to address all other possible causes of low libido before starting testosterone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t sometimes prescribe it, but it\u2019s after addressing a lot of other concerns,\u201d she said.",
      "For Marcella Hill, 44, the symptoms of depression, body aches and low sex drive were affecting her relationship with her husband.",
      "\u201cI was really suffering,\u201d said Hill who lives in Vineyard, Utah. Her doctor told her that it was just normal.",
      "\u201cI thought that\u2019s insane. I can\u2019t live like this,\u201d Hill said.",
      "At first, she was given a testosterone gel prescription but didn\u2019t notice an improvement and found it hard to use.",
      "Frustrated that her doctor didn\u2019t offer more help, she went to a local medical clinic at a friend\u2019s urging and started testosterone pellet therapy, a more potent version of the hormone.",
      "After two years of treatment, she says the results have been life-changing.",
      "\u201cA couple months into it, all of a sudden my libido turns back on,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be with my husband and I have this passion, this desire that I hadn\u2019t had since college.\u201d",
      "She posts about her testosterone therapy on Instagram and other social media.",
      "\u201c\u200b\u200bI opened TikTok to just tell that story, and the next day my phone blew up with 9 million views,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen all over the whole world were like, \u2018Wait, I have all these symptoms.\u2019\u201d",
      "Hill isn\u2019t paid for promoting testosterone, although she has worked with a telehealth company in ads urging women to get regular medical checkups.",
      "She gets her levels checked regularly and says that her testosterone is closer to the low end for a male. While she is not worried about her high levels, she does have an unwanted side effect \u2014 excess hair growth on her face.",
      "Is testosterone therapy safe?",
      "When prescribed by a doctor and carefully monitored, testosterone is relatively safe for women and side effects are rare, experts said.",
      "When men start testosterone therapy, it is typically given in a gel with a dose of 50-100 mg a day.",
      "Women, on the other hand, are recommended to take just 5 mg a day \u2014 10% of the dose of a man.",
      "Higher doses for women can cause side effects including acne, excessive body hair and even body odor. Some are permanent.",
      "Voedisch recalls one patient who finally stopped testosterone therapy after her voice was altered.",
      "\u201cShe said, \u2018What really did it for me was once I was on the phone and somebody called me \u2018sir,\u2019\u201d said Voedisch.",
      "Voedisch warned about side effects from improper dosing. \u201cIt may not get better even once you stop, which is really unfortunate.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s sympathetic to patients who feel ignored by doctors and are frustrated with the lack of treatment options available for perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms.",
      "\u201cWe have ignored women\u2019s health for a very long time in this country,\u201d said Voedisch. \u201cThis comes from a place of frustration and it comes from a place of wanting to feel better.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is looming over the domestic box office in its third weekend of release. The third and final installment in Sony\u2019s comic book trilogy has added $16.2 million from 3,905 North American theaters, down 37% from the prior frame and enough to lead over two newcomers, A24\u2019s horror thriller \u201cHeretic\u201d and Lionsgate\u2019s family friendly \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\u201d",
      "Although those new releases weren\u2019t able to topple \u201cVenom 3\u201d from No. 1, they opened on the higher end of expectations, thanks to word-of-mouth and the otherwise desolate movie theater landscape. Hollywood mostly avoided the post-election weekend out of concern that people wouldn\u2019t be paying attention to anything other than the presidential race. As a result, overall domestic box office revenues remain down more than 11% from 2023 and nearly 27% from 2019, according to Comscore.",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d featuring \u201cNotting Hill\u201d star Hugh Grant playing against type as a villain, notched third place with $11 million from 3,221 venues. The cat-and-mouse thriller follows two young Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher and\u00a0Chloe East) who make the grave mistake of knocking on the door of a reclusive Englishman (Grant). Critics dug the film, which holds a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, and its \u201cC+\u201d grade on CinemaScore isn\u2019t all that surprising for a horror story with a divisive ending.",
      "\u201cThis is a very good opening for an original horror film,\u201d says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \u201c2024 isn\u2019t the strongest year at the box office, but the horror genre is alive and fully engaging its young audience.\u201d",
      "A very different kind of religious parable, \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d\u00a0opened at No. 2 with $11.1 million from 3,020 locations. However, this number is skewed because it includes $2.2 million from last week\u2019s one-night-only sneak preview screening. The low-budget, faith-based film about six naughty siblings who take over the local church holiday pageant and learn the true meaning of Christmas has been roundly embraced by critics and audiences. \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever,\u201d directed by Dallas Jenkins (\u201cThe Chosen\u201d) and starring Judy Greer, Pete Holmes and Lauren Graham, received an 89% average on Rotten Tomatoes and \u201cA\u201d grade on CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cTwo-and-a-half weeks before Thanksgiving, the film is getting a jump on the other broad-appeal holiday releases,\u201d Gross says, referring to Amazon\u2019s Christmas comedy \u201cRed One,\u201d with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson playing Santa\u2019s head of security, on Nov. 15, followed by Paramount\u2019s \u201cGladiator II\u201d and Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d on Nov. 22, and Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2\u201d on Nov. 27. \u201cWith support, [\u2018The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u2019] has a chance of holding its own heading into strong Thanksgiving competition.\u201d",
      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d has generated $114 million in North America and $394.2 million globally to date. Though it\u2019s falling short of other entries in the Tom Hardy-led symbiote saga \u2014 2018\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d powered to $213 million domestically and $856 million globally and 2021\u2019s \u201cLet There Be Carnage\u201d ended with $213 million domestically and $506 million worldwide \u2014 this entry will be decently positioned in its theatrical run against its $120 million budget.",
      "Elsewhere at the domestic box office, Universal and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d dropped to fourth place with $6.6 million from 3,051 theaters in its seventh weekend on the big screen. The well-reviewed family film has endured at the box office with minimal week-to-week drops (this weekend was down only 11%), earning $130.2 million domestically and $292 million worldwide so far.",
      "Paramount\u2019s pop star parable \u201cSmile 2\u201d rounded out the top five with $5 million from 2,822 locations, declining just 26% from the prior weekend. After four weekends on the big screen, the R-rated sequel to 2022\u2019s thriller \u201cSmile\u201d has generated $60.5 million in North America and $123.6 million worldwide. It cost $28 million and will become profitable, but the original was bigger with $105 million in North America and $217 million globally.",
      "Also of note, \u201cHere,\u201d a fantasy drama that uses AI so Tom Hanks and Robin Wright can play younger (and older) versions of themselves, stumbled to the No. 8 spot with $2.4 million its second weekend of release. Ticket sales declined 52% from its soft $5 million debut, bringing the Robert Zemeckis-directed film to $9.3 million domestically. \u201cHere,\u201d produced and financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony,\u00a0cost $45 million and needs a long life in theaters to justify that price tag.",
      "Meanwhile, the Ralph Fiennes-led thriller \u201cConclave\u201d enjoyed another strong showing with $4.1 million from 2,283 theaters, enough for sixth place on domestic charts. The adult-skewing film, a Vatican-set drama from Focus Features, has grossed a solid $21.5 million after three weekends, with New York and other East Coast markets bringing in the biggest audience.",
      "\u201c\u2018Conclave\u2019 has truly been a standout among awards season dramas,\u201d says senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. \u201cAn ideal release date and a slow rollout positioned the film perfectly for continued success throughout the holiday and awards seasons.\u201d"

    "summary": "Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s poor showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain the embattled Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s dismal showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
      "Ishiba, 67, became prime minister of the key U.S. ally on Oct. 1 shortly after winning the leadership race for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II. But his future in the role was in question after the party suffered its worst election defeat in more than a decade, losing support from voters angry about corruption scandals and the rising cost of living.",
      "That left the LDP without a parliamentary majority, but Ishiba was nonetheless able to retain his hold on power and will rule with a minority government. He must now face the challenges of a weakened and unpopular governing party as well as a possible shift in approach from Washington after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Ishiba, a straight-talking former defense minister, received 221 votes compared with 160 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. Other candidates received a total of 84 votes.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, \u201cis faced with the most severe and complicated security environment in the postwar era,\u201d Ishiba said Saturday at an annual troop review at a Japanese military base outside Tokyo, vowing to strengthen the country\u2019s diplomatic efforts as well as its defense capabilities.",
      "He cited violations of Japanese airspace in August and September by China and Russia, as well as a Chinese aircraft carrier entering Japan\u2019s contiguous waters for the first time in September. Japan and other countries around the world are also concerned by accelerated weapons testing in nuclear-armed North Korea, which this year signed a mutual defense pact with Russia.",
      "The U.S.-Japan alliance is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Japan\u2019s diplomacy and security, said Ishiba, who said he and Trump had pledged to \u201cwork together to take the Japan-U.S. alliance to new heights\u201d in a phone call after Trump\u2019s election victory last week.",
      "Japan has a lot to worry about from a second Trump presidency, Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar at Harvard\u2019s Weatherhead Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, told NBC News in an interview before the U.S. election last week.",
      "Many Japanese officials assume Trump is going to be \u201cmore straightforwardly anti-China,\u201d and that Japan will be \u201csomehow miraculously left off the hook,\u201d he said. But they are \u201cmisreading\u201d the U.S. president-elect, he said, despite his famous friendship with the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs should be taken \u201cvery seriously,\u201d Nakano said, considering Japan\u2019s widening trade surplus with the U.S., its top export destination. They could have \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for a country already wrestling with rising costs and a \u201cvery low\u201d currency, he said.",
      "Japan can also expect pressure from the Trump administration to spend more on defense, David Boling, director of Japan and Asian trade at the New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group, said in a briefing after the U.S. election last week.",
      "Though Japan has already pledged to double\u00a0defense spending\u00a0to\u00a02% of gross domestic product by\u00a02027, \u201cthat\u2019s probably not going to be enough to satisfy Trump,\u201d Boling said.",
      "There is also strong U.S. opposition to Japanese company Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden, Trump and his Democratic rival in the U.S. presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, had all come out against the deal.",
      "\u201cIt looks pretty dead,\u201d Boling said. The only way to revive it, he said, is for Nippon Steel to reach an agreement with United Steelworkers, a Pittsburgh-based union that has vocally opposed the takeover.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, told reporters last week that the company hoped to close the deal by the end of the year, before Trump takes office.",
      "Much will come down to interpersonal relations. While Abe was \u201cextraordinarily skillful\u201d in dealing with Trump, Ishiba has a different personality, Boling said.",
      "Ishiba \u201cis more of a deep thinker type,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s known to be something of a defense intellectual, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to work that well with Trump.\u201d",
      "Japan does have a few things working in its favor, Boling said. It is unlikely to be at the top of Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade target list,\u201d and would do well to remind him that it is the top source of foreign direct investment in the United States.",
      "The U.S. also \u201crecognizes that Japan has really become an indispensable ally in the Indo-Pacific region, and that for Washington to have an effective policy on economic policy or national security policy directed towards China, it really needs Japan on its team,\u201d Boling said.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s second term could be challenging for Japan, where many see him as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in terms of security and the global economy, Jeff Kingston, professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, said in an interview before the U.S. election.",
      "\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t think Trump would be a welcome partner. They saw how disastrous it was last time around,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cBut Japan will adjust because the security environment is quite risky and they need the American security umbrella.\u201d",

      "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut and far from the areas in southern and eastern Lebanon where the militant Hezbollah group has a major presence. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",
      "Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said the dead include nine women, and that the toll was likely to rise as rescue efforts continue.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a site where militants were operating in Jabaliya, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review.",
      "A separate strike on Sunday hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders organization that operates under the government.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in\u00a0only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said\u00a0famine is imminent in the north\u00a0or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as\u00a0the deadline approaches\u00a0for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or\u00a0risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel\u2019s ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019 attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel\u00a0has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups\u00a0have long accused\u00a0the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent.\u00a0Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and\u00a0killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s strike in Aalmat, some 25 miles north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250.\u00a0Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the fatalities were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions\u00a0have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins\u00a0and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people,\u00a0often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of\u00a0when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",
      "Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled since the start of the year, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Qatar, which has served as a key mediator with Hamas, said over the weekend that\u00a0it had suspended its efforts\u00a0and would only resume them when \u201cthe parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\u201d"

      "The first episode finds viewers in the middle of major drama as emergency services and caution tape surround John Dutton\u2019s mansion. As Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) runs to the house with Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes) not far behind her, it becomes imminently clear that something is wrong with their father.",
      "As the siblings enter the home, viewers find that Governor Dutton has supposedly died by suicide. Beth immediately accuses Jamie (Wes Bentley) of having killed their father. While this opener is a jarring way to start off the second half of Season 5 \u2014 the episode quickly pivots to another scene.",
      "Viewers are now taken back to six weeks prior to Dutton's death as they follow Beth, Kayce, and their families in the days leading up to the tragedy. During the episode, time jumps back and forth between what led up to John Dutton\u2019s death and its aftermath.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Wendy Moniz, who plays Governor Lynelle Perry, says she believes the series handled John Dutton's storyline \"beautifully.\"",
      "\"What I know of the story telling \u2014 because it was redacted and we only know certain parts \u2014 is brilliant, because Taylor's [Sheridan] writing is that,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"the story that he had from the beginning is the story that he wanted to tell.\"",
      "Is Kevin Costner involved in Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Despite his character being a central figure in the episode \u2014 we never actually see Costner. When Beth and Kayce enter the gruesome scene where John Dutton was believed to have shot himself, the audience only sees a limp hand, and a pool of blood.",
      "How do they write off Kevin Costner\u2019s character in 'Yellowstone'?",
      "As the first episode unravels, viewers quickly learn that John Dutton's death was not in fact suicide. Rather, it was a murder-for-hire scheme set forth by Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri) who was in cahoots with Jamie Dutton. Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",
      "While  John Dutton\u2019s death is made clear in the first few minutes of the episode \u2014 viewers soon learn that his presence still looms in the minds of the Dutton family.",
      "But, will we see actor Kevin Costner is one last scene? That is yet to be determined.",
      "Is this really the end for 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Paramount+ confirmed that this would be the final season for the Dutton family \u2014 but fans, and some of the show's stars, think that there could be room for more.",
      "When asked if this was the last season for \"Yellowstone\" by TODAY.com, Ian Bohen, who plays Ryan, a Dutton family ranch hand, teases \"it may not\" be the end.",
      "\"I feel satisfied, and very happy with what we've done. You know stories can't go on forever,\" he says. \"We're going to position it to have some sort of conclusion in some of the relationships and this and that. But not necessarily over.\"",
      "What are the 'Yellowstone' spinoffs?",
      "The expanding \"Yellowstone\" universe already has two popular spinoffs within the franchise and more on the way. The various shows travel throughout time, chronicling the same family over the course of hundreds of years.",
      "This prequel was packed with star power, including country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, and actor Sam Elliot. The show traveled back in time to chronicle how the Dutton family first settled in Montana.",
      "Oscar winner Helen Mirren and legendary actor Harrison Ford led the cast of this prequel, which showed the next generation of Dutton family. Season 2 is currently in production.",
      "Another prequel series, this \"1944\" edition is greenlit for production. Further details, including a release date, are unknown.",
      "Formerly titled \"2024,\" this series will star Michelle Pfeiffer, and is set to follow the story of a New York family that moves to Montana. Currently, we don't know how the story will intertwine with the current characters of the Yellowstone universe.",
      "Another series featured in the \"Yellowstone\" universe is \"6666,\" pronounced \"Four Sixes,\" based on the real Four Sixes ranch in Texas, which Sheridan now himself owns.",
      "This spinoff will follow storylines on that ranch, however as of June that series was on hold. Sheridan told The Hollywood Reporter that because it's a real ranch with real families, it needs a \"unique level of special care.\""

      "Redmayne was sharing what he learned during physical training for an upcoming series, and after Mescal and Norton made jokes about using a phone to protect themselves during an altercation, Ronan reminded the actors how often women prepare for the possibility of physical violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time. Am I right, ladies?\u201d Ronan asked, cutting laughter from Redmayne, Norton and others abruptly short.",
      "The moment went viral on social media, as some users emphasized not only with Ronan's point, but the reaction from her fellow actors and the audience.",
      "Ronan spoke about her comments on TODAY Nov. 7, saying that she thought it was important that the moment should be kept in context with the larger interview, in which the actors discussed the prep work needed to do certain jobs.",
      "She then went into detail on what surprised her about the viral response to her words.",

      "Ronan referenced the murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard in the U.K. in 2021. Everard was a marketing executive who disappeared while walking home from a friend's house in London. A week later, Everard's body was found about 50 miles away in a wooded area in Kent.",

      "Prosecutors said Couzens used his position as a police officer to place Everard under false arrest, before driving her in a rental car to a secluded area, where he raped and murdered her, before burning her body and clothing.",
      "Ronan reflected on the tragedy, saying, \"She followed all the rules, and she did everything that she was supposed to do to keep herself safe, and she still ended up dead. And I think that that really opened up this conversation for everyone back at home.\"",
      "The actor said that since Everard's murder, she's been more vocal in her personal life, with both women and men.",
      "\"So it was just sort of something that naturally came up on the show, but it's been really interesting to see what the response has been like,\" she said. \"It's just sort of gone everywhere.",
      "\"I think people have needed something like this, on a platform like that, to go, OK, we can talk about it now, and just to talk about that,\" she continued. \"And of course, it's not something that guys would have to think about, but I think it's really important for us, for all of our little young girls that are growing up, that we go like, 'This is the this is the mentality that a woman has to have, and that a young girl has to have every day ever.'\"",
      "Reps for Redmayne, Mescal and Washington did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com last month."

    "summary": "Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s poor showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain the embattled Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s dismal showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
      "Ishiba, 67, became prime minister of the key U.S. ally on Oct. 1 shortly after winning the leadership race for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II. But his future in the role was in question after the party suffered its worst election defeat in more than a decade, losing support from voters angry about corruption scandals and the rising cost of living.",
      "That left the LDP without a parliamentary majority, but Ishiba was nonetheless able to retain his hold on power and will rule with a minority government. He must now face the challenges of a weakened and unpopular governing party as well as a possible shift in approach from Washington after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Ishiba, a straight-talking former defense minister, received 221 votes compared with 160 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. Other candidates received a total of 84 votes.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, \u201cis faced with the most severe and complicated security environment in the postwar era,\u201d Ishiba said Saturday at an annual troop review at a Japanese military base outside Tokyo, vowing to strengthen the country\u2019s diplomatic efforts as well as its defense capabilities.",
      "He cited violations of Japanese airspace in August and September by China and Russia, as well as a Chinese aircraft carrier entering Japan\u2019s contiguous waters for the first time in September. Japan and other countries around the world are also concerned by accelerated weapons testing in nuclear-armed North Korea, which this year signed a mutual defense pact with Russia.",
      "The U.S.-Japan alliance is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Japan\u2019s diplomacy and security, said Ishiba, who said he and Trump had pledged to \u201cwork together to take the Japan-U.S. alliance to new heights\u201d in a phone call after Trump\u2019s election victory last week.",
      "Japan has a lot to worry about from a second Trump presidency, Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar at Harvard\u2019s Weatherhead Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, told NBC News in an interview before the U.S. election last week.",
      "Many Japanese officials assume Trump is going to be \u201cmore straightforwardly anti-China,\u201d and that Japan will be \u201csomehow miraculously left off the hook,\u201d he said. But they are \u201cmisreading\u201d the U.S. president-elect, he said, despite his famous friendship with the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs should be taken \u201cvery seriously,\u201d Nakano said, considering Japan\u2019s widening trade surplus with the U.S., its top export destination. They could have \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for a country already wrestling with rising costs and a \u201cvery low\u201d currency, he said.",
      "Japan can also expect pressure from the Trump administration to spend more on defense, David Boling, director of Japan and Asian trade at the New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group, said in a briefing after the U.S. election last week.",
      "Though Japan has already pledged to double\u00a0defense spending\u00a0to\u00a02% of gross domestic product by\u00a02027, \u201cthat\u2019s probably not going to be enough to satisfy Trump,\u201d Boling said.",
      "There is also strong U.S. opposition to Japanese company Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden, Trump and his Democratic rival in the U.S. presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, had all come out against the deal.",
      "\u201cIt looks pretty dead,\u201d Boling said. The only way to revive it, he said, is for Nippon Steel to reach an agreement with United Steelworkers, a Pittsburgh-based union that has vocally opposed the takeover.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, told reporters last week that the company hoped to close the deal by the end of the year, before Trump takes office.",
      "Much will come down to interpersonal relations. While Abe was \u201cextraordinarily skillful\u201d in dealing with Trump, Ishiba has a different personality, Boling said.",
      "Ishiba \u201cis more of a deep thinker type,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s known to be something of a defense intellectual, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to work that well with Trump.\u201d",
      "Japan does have a few things working in its favor, Boling said. It is unlikely to be at the top of Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade target list,\u201d and would do well to remind him that it is the top source of foreign direct investment in the United States.",
      "The U.S. also \u201crecognizes that Japan has really become an indispensable ally in the Indo-Pacific region, and that for Washington to have an effective policy on economic policy or national security policy directed towards China, it really needs Japan on its team,\u201d Boling said.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s second term could be challenging for Japan, where many see him as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in terms of security and the global economy, Jeff Kingston, professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, said in an interview before the U.S. election.",
      "\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t think Trump would be a welcome partner. They saw how disastrous it was last time around,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cBut Japan will adjust because the security environment is quite risky and they need the American security umbrella.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis trivialization\u00a0is both culturally insensitive and harmful,\" it said. The book also contained errors made by mixing different Indigenous languages, which NATSIEC said reinforced the \"harmful stereotype that Indigenous peoples are a homogenous group.\"",

      "In August, the international aid agency Save the Children published a report saying that Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change and that 25 of its 34 provinces face severe or catastrophic drought conditions, affecting more than half the population.",
      "Afghanistan also had the highest number of children made homeless by\u00a0climate disasters\u00a0of any country as of the end of 2023, according to the report.",

    "summary": "A soldier for Yemen\u2019s exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom\u2019s nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday.",

      "A soldier for Yemen\u2019s exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom\u2019s nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday.",
      "The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and\u00a0Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels\u00a0largely has held despite the militants\u2019 ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being \u201cthe beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after\u00a0the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone\u00a0over the country.",
      "The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 310 miles east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement.",
      "\u201cThe Joint Forces Command underscores that this \u2018Lone Wolf\u2019 cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,\u201d the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added.",
      "Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen\u2019s successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun.",
      "Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier\u2019s arrest. That\u2019s worth around $15,000 on the black market.",
      "Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group\u2019s Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to \u201ccoordinate operations directly with each other.\u201d",
      "The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from \u201cthe feeling of oppression\u201d over Saudi troops being stationed in the area.",
      "\u201cThe heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,\u201d Rizq wrote.",
      "Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen\u2019s exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate.",
      "The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.\u00a0A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on\u00a0the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in the Gaza Strip and Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon.",
      "On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes.",
      "The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes \u201con numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\u201d It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor, but offered no other immediate details.",
      "The U.S. military has targeted radar stations,\u00a0military bases\u00a0and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state TV on Sunday reported that chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, met his Saudi counterpart, Gen. Fayyad bin Hamid Al-Ruwaili, in Tehran \u2014 the latest sign of warming ties between the two regional rivals.",
      "It reported that Al-Ruwaili arrived in Tehran earlier in the day, leading a high-ranking delegation of Saudi Arabian military officials, and that the development of defense diplomacy and expansion of bilateral cooperation were key topics of discussion during the meeting.",
      "Iran and Saudi Arabia resumed full diplomatic relations in 2023 after seven years, facilitated by China\u2019s mediation."
