      "Pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course next year at Yale University",
      "With a record 99 Grammy nominations and acclaim as one of the most influential artists in music history, pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course at Yale University next year.",
      "Titled \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Makes History: Black Radical Tradition, Culture, Theory & Politics Through Music,\u201d the one-credit class will focus on the period from her 2013 self-titled album through this year's genre-defying \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d and how the world-famous singer, songwriter and entrepreneur has generated awareness and engagement in social and political ideologies.",
      "Yale University's African American Studies Professor Daphne Brooks intends to use the performer's wide-ranging repertoire, including footage of her live performances, as a \u201cportal\u201d for students to learn about Black intellectuals, from Frederick Douglass to Toni Morrison.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking seriously the ways in which the critical work, the intellectual work of some of our greatest thinkers in American culture resonates with Beyonc\u00e9's music and thinking about the ways in which we can apply their philosophies to her work\" and how it has sometimes been at odds with the \u201cBlack radical intellectual tradition,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, whose full name is Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, is not the first performer to be the subject of a college-level course. There have been courses on singer and songwriter Bob Dylan over the years and several colleges and universities have recently offered classes on singer Taylor Swift and her lyrics and pop culture legacy. That includes law professors who hope to engage a new generation of lawyers by using a famous celebrity like Swift to bring context to complicated, real-world concepts.",
      "Professors at other colleges and universities have also incorporated Beyonc\u00e9 into their courses or offered classes on the superstar.",
      "Brooks sees Beyonc\u00e9 in a league of her own, crediting the singer with using her platform to \u201cspectacularly elevate awareness of and engagement with grassroots, social, political ideologies and movements\u201d in her music, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Black feminist commentary.",
      "\u201cCan you think of any other pop musician who\u2019s invited an array of grassroots activists to participate in these longform multimedia album projects that she\u2019s given us since 2013,\" asked Brooks. She noted how Beyonc\u00e9 has also tried to tell a story through her music about \u201crace and gender and sexuality in the context of the 400-year-plus history of African-American subjugation.\"",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating artist because historical memory, as I often refer to it, and also the kind of impulse to be an archive of that historical memory, it's just all over her work,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd you just don\u2019t see that with any other artist.\u201d",
      "Brooks previously taught a well-received class on Black women in popular music culture at Princeton University and discovered her students were most excited about the portion dedicated to Beyonc\u00e9. She expects her class at Yale will be especially popular, but she's trying to keep the size of the group relatively small.",
      "For those who manage to snag a seat next semester, they shouldn't get their hopes up about seeing Queen Bey in person.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too bad because if she were on tour, I would definitely try to take the class to see her,\" Brooks said."

      "Caitr\u00edona Balfe and Sam Heughan, who have played time traveler Claire and 18th century Highlander Jamie since the show began, recently teased their bittersweet goodbye. Speaking less than a fortnight after their official wrap day, with only a few pick-up shots left to shoot, the stars described filming their final scene for the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIt was very emotional. I was very emotional,\u201d Balfe said.",
      "\u201cI was, too,\u201d Heughan agreed. \u201cWe ended on a scene, well, I think \u2014 it was quite tough to do because it was a real Jamie-Claire moment, so it felt quite fitting. And I think they scheduled it like that. But it was also quite intense because a lot of the crew came to sort of celebrate or watch the final take of the final scene.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd there was a lot of words,\u201d added Balfe. \u201cIt was really hard to get through it because it also felt like everything had sort of this double meaning, you know, it\u2019s a lot of talk about goodbyes and things.\u201d",
      "Based on the books by Diana Gabaldon and mostly filmed in Scotland, the long-running show has leapt across time periods, including the Jacobite Rising, 1740s Versailles, 1960s Boston, the Revolutionary War \u2014 and more.",
      "\u201cI played Jamie when he was 23 and now he\u2019s sort of around 60. So it\u2019s quite a journey,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cThe show is always changing, always moving, it\u2019s a real journey that they\u2019ve been on from Scotland to America. And I think it\u2019s very rewarding. I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t in a sort of procedural where we had to sort of be in the same location all the time.\u201d",
      "The concluding half of Season 7, premiering Nov. 22 on Starz, begins with the couple returning to Jamie\u2019s homeland of Scotland, before America \u2014 and the rebel cause in the Revolutionary War \u2014 calls again, testing their marriage like never before.",
      "\u201cReturning home obviously is going to be so rewarding for Jamie, but also for the fans,\u201d Heughan said, \u201cbecause I think the fans, they get to see a lot of, their favorite characters and their favorite locations.\u201d",
      "The latest episodes weave in storylines involving Claire and Jamie\u2019s time-traveling daughter Brianna and her husband Roger (Sophie Skelton and Richard Rankin) and Jamie\u2019s nephew Ian (John Bell), as well as Jamie\u2019s secret son William (Charles Vandervaart) and the British lord who is raising him.",
      "Season 7 also features one of Heughan's favorite co-stars \u2014 one he confirms fans won\u2019t be seeing in Season 8.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually the last time you see Sleepy,\u201d Heughan says. \u201cHe was my horse throughout first seasons. And he\u2019s a black Friesian with a white spot on him. And actually, if you look closely, he somehow transports himself to America as well because he doubles up as a horse in America. But yeah, I mean, we say goodbye to a lot of locations, a lot of characters in Season 7B.\u201d",
      "With the last season still to come, and the \u201cOutlander\u201d universe expanding with the upcoming prequel \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d the story will continue for fans \u2014 although Balfe and Heughan will be getting used to their \u201cDroughtlander,\u201d the term fans coined for periods without the show.",
      "\u201cIt has been our lives for the last 11 years. We\u2019ve built families and homes in Scotland,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cSo, yes, it\u2019s quite a change that we\u2019re about to face.\u201d"

      "\u201cPeople will walk up and spend one minute and come up to me and say, \u2018Wow, this is amazing. This made my day. This made my week. I really needed this,' \" Chavez said on Friday. \"It seems like such a small thing, but it can be really, really important to the people that participate.\u201d",
      "Chavez, 36, said the project was not a reaction to the election of Republican Donald Trump as president but that \"because it invites people to express how they\u2019re feeling at the time that they\u2019re feeling it, certainly the context of the election influences what people write about.\u201d",
      "Quickly scribbled notes went up on the tiled wall under 14th Street in Manhattan as Chavez spoke.",

      "Another contributor, Mallie Lyons, said she liked the subway therapy project and its site. \u201cI feel like this is a really good idea,\" she said. \u201cI mean, I think especially somewhere where people can walk by and physically see what other people are feeling and what other people are thinking I think is such a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "The project ended over the weekend, but Chavez is looking for possible locations for future iterations, even if they are not as good as the subway tunnel.",
      "\u201cPeople have so much to say,\u201d he said. \"And I love being in places where people are moving from one place to another. They just stop. They real quick get something off their chest, and then they\u2019re on their way.\u201d"

      "Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has been sentenced to 45 days in prison after repeatedly violating probation, disappointing a federal judge who rewarded his cooperation in a criminal case against him with leniency five years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was sentenced Tuesday to 45 days in prison by a federal judge who said repeated violations of his probation after his cooperation against a violent gang won him leniency in a criminal case show that he doesn't have sufficient respect for judicial system rules.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the additional time be spent behind bars five years after giving the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez a two-year prison sentence that likely would have been decades behind bars if he had not testified at trial against the violent gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "The Manhattan judge said that five violations of probation rules including failing to show up for drug tests, traveling to Las Vegas from his Florida home without permission and lying to his probation officer \u201csay to me loud and clear that you don't believe the rules apply to you.\u201d",
      "He questioned whether Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, thought he was above the law \u201cmaybe because you\u2019re a famous and wealthy rapper.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the same rules do apply to you,\u201d Englemayer said.",
      "Before the judge announced the jail time, Tekashi 6ix9ine asked for mercy, saying he was disappointed in himself for having to face him again just a half year before his probation would have expired.",
      "\u201cI'm very sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not minimizing my actions. I fully take responsibility. I let myself down. I let my family down. Give me an opportunity to clean things up.\u201d",
      "He said he didn't want the judge to \u201cthink of me as ill mannered or I'm a bad person,\" and he insisted that \u201cI don't go out of my way to break the law.\u201d",
      "After his jail stint is finished, Tekashi 6ix9ine will be subject to a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfews as apart of an extension of his probation period by one year. He also will not be allowed to travel internationally and will face electronic monitoring.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was granted compassionate release from prison several months before his sentence was finished because asthma made him susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation\u2019s jails and prisons.",
      "He was arrested on Oct. 29 and has spent the past two weeks in solitary confinement, a particularly harsh detainment that the judge described as a reason why he didn't impose a three-month jail term.",
      "In 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine was arrested on charges accusing him of joining Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods before trying to get others to commit violence against his perceived enemies.",
      "Engelmayer said the singer's parole violations weren't \u201cgravely serious,\u201d but they were \u201cprofound\u201d breaches of the court's trust.",
      "He also said Tekashi 6ix9ine has \u201crepeatedly flown very close to the flame\u201d as he cited two instances in which he was arrested in the Dominican Republic and a speeding violation for allegedly going 136 mph in a 65 mph zone.",
      "\u201cYour repeated brushes with the law underscore the need to get this message across to you,\u201d the judge said."

      "Recent changes to state law have empowered parents and residents to challenge school library books and required districts to submit an annual report to the state detailing which books have been restricted in their schools. Florida continues to lead the country in pulling books from school libraries, according to analyses by the American Library Association and the advocacy group PEN America.",
      "\u201cA restriction of access is a restriction on one\u2019s freedom to read,\u201d said Kasey Meehan of PEN America. \u201cStudents lose the ability to access books that mirror their own lived experiences, to access books that help them learn and empathize with people who \u2026 have different life experiences.\u201d",
      "The list released for the 2023-2024 school year includes titles by American literary icons like Maya Angelou, Flannery O\u2019Connor and Richard Wright, as well as books that have become top targets for censorship across the country because they feature LGBTQ+ characters, discussions of gender and sexuality, and descriptions of sexual encounters, such as \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d by George Johnson and \u201cGender Queer\u201d by Maia Kobabe. Conservative advocates have labeled such content \u201cpornographic.\u201d",

      "In a statement to The Associated Press, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education maintained there are no books being banned in Florida and defended the state\u2019s push to remove \u201csexually explicit materials\u201d from schools.",
      "\u201cOnce again, far left activists are pushing the book ban hoax on Floridians. The better question is why do these activists continue to fight to expose children to sexually explicit materials,\u201d spokesperson Sydney Booker said.",
      "The list shows that book removals vary widely across the state, with some districts not reporting any restrictions and others tallying hundreds of titles pulled from the shelves. Farrell of the Florida Freedom to Read Project said that based on the group\u2019s analysis of public records, the department\u2019s report is an undercount because it doesn\u2019t include books removed following an internal staff review, just those pulled following a complaint from a parent or resident.",
      "Farrell believes most Florida parents want their kids to have broad access to literature.",
      "\u201cWe live in a state where parental rights are supposed to be acknowledged, heard and responded to,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWe are asking for accountability and an accurate record of how these laws are impacting our children and impacting what\u2019s available to them.\u201d",
      "Schools have restricted access to dozens of books by Stephen King, a master of the horror genre known for bestsellers like \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cPet Sematary.\u201d Officials in Clay County also decided that his book \u201cOn Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\u201d was inappropriate for students.",

      "Veteran broadcaster Chris Wallace is leaving CNN after three years but, at age 77, he's not interested in retiring",
      "Chris Wallace says he's leaving CNN after three years and, at age 77, is eager to see what a transformed media environment has to offer.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at the media landscape right now, the people who are going independent, whether it's podcasting or streaming, that seems to be where the action is,\u201d he said Tuesday.",
      "It's hard to find a clearer sign of how the business is changing. Wallace is the quintessential broadcast newscaster, son of the CBS News legend Mike Wallace, worked at both ABC and NBC News and was host of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d for 18 years before exiting for CNN in 2021.",
      "He was hired to be a leading personality for the CNN+ streaming service, which the company abandoned a month after its launch in 2022. That forced him to cobble together a role at CNN, with a Saturday morning political show and a broader interview program on Max, and appearances on the network as a commentator.",
      "Wallace called the exit amicable. CNN CEO Mark Thompson called him \u201cone of the most respected political journalists in the news business\u201d and said that he wishes him the best.",
      "Thompson likely faces some hard decisions in the future, with CNN's television ratings cratering and an increased emphasis on digital looming.",
      "Wallace said having control over what he does is more appealing to him at this stage of his career. Don't expect big changes in his brand \u2014 he'll likely stick with interviews and political analysis, and not favor one political side over another \u2014 and he said he's already heard some expressions of interest.",
      "Retirement's not in the blood. His father worked well into his late 80s at \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Besides, Chris Wallace said, \u201cnobody in my family wants me to retire.\u201d",

      "The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso",
      "OUGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso -- The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso.",
      "She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler.",
      "But last month, she got to be a queen.",
      "Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital.",
      "\u201cI was so happy about it,\" she said. \"I don't even know how to explain how it felt.\u201d",
      "Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship.",
      "But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups.",
      "The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.",
      "The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other.",
      "But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time.",
      "Bougsemtenga derives its name from \u201cbougtenga,\u201d which means \u201chappiness district\u201d in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\" More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while.",
      "Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people\u2019s courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open.",
      "Aristide Tarnagda, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned.",
      "Theater is an affirmation of \u201cthe primacy of life over death,\u201d Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was \"Turning the face to the sun.\u201d",
      "\u201cHumans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role of the theater is to remind them about it.\u201d",
      "Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002.",
      "They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a working class district,\" Sankara said. \u201dWe want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.\"",
      "She added: \u201cArt is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,\u201d especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis.",
      "Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job.",
      "It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. \u201cTheater saved me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me discover what I could do.\u201d",
      "This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence.",
      "For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others.",
      "During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains \u2014 for how long.",
      "\u201cLife is very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It\u2019s when I have to go back home that all these thoughts are coming back to my head.\"",

      "Joining them on the ballot are Bryan Adams, with radio staples like \u201cSummer of \u201969\u201d and \u201cHave You Ever Really Loved a Woman?,\u201d and Mike Love of the Beach Boys, hoping to get in 25 years after band founder Brian Wilson. David Gates, co-lead singer of the pop-music group Bread, is also looking for entry.",
      "The Hall annually inducts performers and non-performers alike, and the latter category this year includes Walter Afanasieff, who helped Mariah Carey with her smash \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You;\u201d Mike Chapman, who co-wrote Pat Benatar\u2019s \u201cLove Is a Battlefield;\u201d and Narada Michael Walden, the architect of Whitney Houston's \u201cHow Will I Know\u2033 and Aretha Franklin's \"Freeway of Love.\u201d",
      "Eligible voting members have until Dec. 22 to turn in ballots with their choices of three nominees from the songwriter category and three from the performing-songwriter category. The Associated Press got an early copy of the list.",

      "If Jackson, whose 1989 album \u201cRhythm Nation\u201d was a landmark, gets into the Hall, it will be more than two decades after her late brother Michael. The Canadian songwriter Morissette, whose influential \u201cJagged Little Pill\u201d has won Grammys, Tonys, Junos and MTV awards would also add to the Hall's rocking women.

It's even harder to believe that it became an Emmy-winning hit with a cast invited to the White House to talk about mental health.",

Fitzgerald originated the role of Boq in \u201cWicked\u201d on Broadway. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him about it \u2018cause I didn\u2019t want to explain when I didn\u2019t get it,'\u201d admitted Slater. Instead, he marked the occasion by asking Fitzgerald to take a selfie with him for seemingly no reason, which he still has.",
      "After getting the job, Slater was determined to master the delicate dance of keeping the essence of Fitzgerald in a role that was now his.",
      "\u201cI look up to him so much,\u201d Slater said of Fitzgerald. \u201cI wanted to honor the Boq he created who\u2019s just, like, a burst of energy. But I also wanted to make him my own because I could never be Chris Fitzgerald. He's too singular and too amazing. It would be a fool\u2019s errand to try to be him.\u201d",
      "In turn, Fitzgerald, who has seen the film, gave Slater's performance a glowing review. Slater says he plans to print and frame a text message that Fitzgerald sent him afterward.",
      "\u201cEthan has this perfect balance of soulfulness and funny bones as an actor,\u201d Fitzgerald said in an email to the AP. \u201cHis Boq is earnest, daffy, and generous of heart. It was such a pleasure and a gift to watch a pal use the spirit of something that\u2019s come before and spin it into something new and wholly original. He is Boq.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d is a prequel to the events of \u201cWizard of Oz.\u201d It stars Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. Jonathan Bailey plays a prince, Fiyero, who encounters Glinda and Elphaba at school.",
      "The story was conceived by Gregory Macguire for a novel called \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d",
      "Slater says filming the big-budget movie directed by Jon M. Chu (\"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \u201cIn the Heights\u201d) actually felt much smaller. At its heart, the cast is just a bunch of theater kids who love to perform.",
      "\u201cI keep quoting Johnny Bailey who said while we were shooting, \u2018it just feels like a student film until suddenly it doesn\u2019t,'\" said Slater.",
      "Erivo, Grande, Bailey and Slater all come from a musical theater background. In 2018, he was nominated for a Tony Award for his leading performance in \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\" on Broadway. He was also in the revival of \u201cSpamalot\" in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe all cared so much. We cared in the way that theater kids care and want to protect this show and want the opportunity to do it. It was really, really joyful and familial,\" said Slater.",
      "Because the experience was so magical, Slater said the actors find themselves reminiscing even when they're not promoting it.",
      "\u201cGoing to dinner last night, we were all still talking about \u2018Wicked,\u2019 and it\u2019s like another theater kid thing, you know, hyper-fixating on this thing that we love so much,\" he said.",
      "The actors sang live on set which Slater said makes for a better performance.",
      "\u201cYou are using your voice in the same way from scene into song, into scene. And there\u2019s no break at all. You\u2019re not thinking about syncing. You\u2019re not thinking about dubbing later. You\u2019re just performing it,\" he said.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d premiering Nov. 22, will be released in two parts. The second film is scheduled for a November 2025 debut.",
      "Slater recognizes that breaking up the film is a \u201ccontroversial decision.\u201d",
      "\"I empathize with that, but when you see this movie, I think it\u2019s a really full movie with a beginning, middle and end. You get to know these characters and love these characters. I think the first thing you\u2019re going to want to do is watch the movie a second time. I\u2019m on pins and needles waiting for the second one.\"",
      "On screen, Boq has an unrequited crush on Glinda. Off screen, Slater and Grande are a couple in real life.",
      "\u201cHer fans are going to be blown away,\" he said. \"Anybody who\u2019s a fan of Ariana knows how talented she is. They know that she has, you know, one of the best voices, of our generation \u2014 or ever \u2014 and can do anything with it. I think that her acting is like above and beyond. It\u2019s incredible. Her comedy is ridiculous.\"",
      "Slater also stars in the film \u201cLost on a Mountain in Maine,\" now in theaters. And he's developing \u201ca really beautiful play about humanity\u201d where he would star as French mime Marcel Marceau.",
      "\u201cThe thing in theater is you can\u2019t really celebrate it until opening night and then you really shouldn\u2019t until it closes either. But we\u2019re really excited about its future, and hopefully there will be more news about it soon.\u201d"

      "After playing Nomi in 2021\u2019s \u201cNo Time To Die,\u201d she was actively avoiding any role that involved working for the secret service. What part could beat a Bond girl who took James Bond\u2019s 007 code name from him?",

      "Lynch and Redmayne are also producers on the show, which is airing on Sky in the U.K. and debuts Thursday on Peacock. They didn\u2019t spend much time together on set, but saw each other in makeup, at the gym and are reunited for this interview with The Associated Press.",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "REDMAYNE: It was so strange to do a job in which you\u2019re so intimately connected to another character, and yet you don\u2019t get to spend any time with the actor. But those moments we did have on set were pretty precious.",

So you see it layered on and there are interesting moments along that process. But it was always at the end of the day when I would take my clothes off and I would sort of have this old German caretaker face and then my sort of scrawny sort of 40-year-old body underneath. That was very disjointed and odd.",
      "LYNCH: That\u2019s one thing that this show does really well and what Ronan (Bennett), our writer, did really well in that, that running in parallel happened so seamlessly that you don\u2019t really see it coming. And every single episode you feel like you want to root for someone like Bianca but the Jackal just makes sense. Even though he\u2019s just done something completely heinous. You almost want to be him, which is, I think, the point.",
      "LYNCH: No, although we crossed over with the spy training. Spy training, which was us just walking around Covent Garden, looking through shop windows, using our phones and car mirrors to find people, to track people and record them without them seeing. This is not just regular people on the street. This is someone that we\u2019ve specifically said!",
      "REDMAYNE: Did they? Oh no! They\u2019ve stolen our thunder.",

      "LYNCH: No, no.",
      "REDMAYNE: You\u2019re sort of more deft around a corner, certainly with the guns you are. Because I spent most of my gun training working on sniper rifles. So when it came to bits when I had to do that thing and move like that (mimes holding a gun) around the corner, I was a bit crap."

      "\u201cThose Opulent Days,\u201d the debut novel of Jacquie Pham, is both \u2014 and a grim coming-of-age story as well.",
      "Pham, who grew up in Vietnam before moving to Australia, ably describes the land of her youth, its history and culture, including the well-heeled Vietnamese who were complicit in the French plunder of resources a century ago.",
      "\u201cThe French ruled the colony,\u201d she writes in the novel, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand its people \u2014 they needed locals, rich enough, corrupt and ambitious enough, to supply them with insight and cash.\u201d",
      "She vividly describes the Vietnamese peasants working long hours in rice paddies, bare feet in muddy water, pale yellow conical hats to block the harsh sun. \u201cThe fields were a vast, luscious green carpet,\u201d Pham writes, \u201calways filled with the fresh, intoxicating scent of young shoots.\u201d But little of this bounty went to impoverished, starving peasant families. \u201cThey would pay ground rent on a monthly basis, with hardly anything to call their own,\u201d Pham writes.",
      "As a mystery novel, \u201cThose Opulent Days\u201d is well-plotted, with a tangled web of possible outcomes. But the allure of the book\u2019s guessing-game narrative and its historical context does not carry over into a fully satisfying reading experience.",
      "The story is beset in part by a cast of vile characters and an overdose of melodramatic scenes. The French rulers and their prosperous Vietnamese collaborators, while living in regal splendor, partake of casual cruelty and horrid murders to such an extent they resemble cardboard cutouts of villains.",
      "This extends partly to the four boys whose fate growing up is at the core of the coming-of-age story. The four are Duy, Minh and Phong, sons of well-to-do families in Annam, as the region then was known, and Edmond, a French youth who met them at a boarding school. They are a mix of friends, rivals and would-be lovers. They binge on opium and alcohol. When they reach their early 20s, they near a dreaded, deadly end predicted by a fortune teller years earlier.",
      "The author understandably wants to convey the reality of the raw power held by the occupying masters over helpless underlings in the French Indochina era. But she has done so at the expense of solid storytelling.",
      "Pham is a young writer with a lot to offer. She succeeds admirably in laying out an enticing mystery, which makes for easy reading even when overwrought. And by linking it to a faded period of history, presaging the United States\u2019 own tragedy in the Vietnam War, she establishes herself as a writer to watch.",

      "Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I \u201con the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\u201d in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead.",

      "His eldest son and the heir to the throne, Prince William, left his own floral tribute \u2014 featuring the Prince of Wales\u2019 feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red.",
      "Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection.",
      "It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be back on occasions like this, but I remember the guys that never came home on my ship when it was torpedoed,\" said 99-year-old Stan Ford, who has had to walk with leg calipers ever since the ship that he was serving on \u2014 HMS Fratton \u2014 was sunk off France's Normandy coast in August 1944 at the cost of 31 lives.",
      "\u201cThey never came home, and I always feel it\u2019s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn\u2019t,\" said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors.",
      "Charles\u2019 ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties.",
      "Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy.",
      "The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties.",
      "Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my wife, I\u2019m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,\u201d William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. \u201cBut from a personal family point of view, it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been brutal.\u201d",
      "While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday.",
      "Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England.",
      "He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cI like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood really. Even if you don\u2019t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.\""

      "23andMe is laying off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinuing its therapeutics division as the struggling genetic testing company attempts to slash costs",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 23andMe is laying off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinuing its therapeutics division as the struggling genetic testing company attempts to slash costs.",
      "The latest restructuring efforts were announced by 23andMe on Monday. The company said it plans to wind down ongoing clinical trials \u201cas quickly as practical\u201d \u2014 and that it was currently evaluating \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d for assets related to its drug development and research programs, which include studies on potential cancer treatments.",
      "In a prepared statement, 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said the company was \"taking these difficult but necessary actions\u201d as it focuses on \u201cthe long-term success of our core consumer business and research partnerships.\u201d",
      "The restructuring arrives during a period of turmoil at California-based 23andMe, which has recently included a high-profile data breach, several rounds of previous layoffs and piling losses that plunged the company's stock over recent years.",
      "Back in September, all of 23andMe\u2019s independent directors also resigned from its board \u2014 in a rare move that followed drawn-out negotiations with Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private. The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",
      "After more than a month with Wojcicki left as the sole member of the board, 23andMe announced that it had appointed three new independent directors in late October.",
      "23andMe went public in 2021 and has struggled to find a profitable business model since \u2014 particularly with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to purchase once. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",
      "Last month, 23andMe completed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Shares were down nearly 4% by midday Tuesday, sitting at around $4.43."

      "Four women suing over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abor...",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Jilliane St. Michel and Rebecca Vincen-Brown shared similar stories, telling the judge how they were devastated when they learned their fetuses had severe conditions that were incompatible with life, and how being forced to travel out of state for abortion care complicated an already tragic experience.",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had anomalies that were the most critical her doctor had ever seen \u2014 and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist anywhere who was willing to attempt an operation to correct the defects. Even if the heart could have been repaired, the veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said. It was possible that she could carry the fetus to term, but he would not survive birth, she said.",
      "Smith already had experience with pregnancy complications. Her daughter was born by emergency c-section at 33 weeks after Smith developed preeclampsia, a dangerous high blood pressure condition that put her at a high risk of having a stroke. Doctors warned her she was at risk of developing preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "They had an autopsy that confirmed the heart defect was even worse than what they had seen on the anatomy scan, she said. They also decided to have Brooks cremated, she said, which meant they had to drive back two weeks later to pick up his remains.",
      "The cost, the inability to work with her chosen doctors, navigating the rules involving how to transport human remains \u2014 all of that would have been avoided if she could have received abortion care in Idaho, Smith said.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "The exceptions to Idaho's abortion bans are unworkable, and put people like Smith, St. Michel and hundreds of other Idaho residents facing similar conditions at risk, Deady said.",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "The women were the first witnesses to testify in the trial that is expected to last through the month."

      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman has filed a lawsuit seeking the right to an abortion in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to restore the right to an abortion in Kentucky in the latest challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, claims that Kentucky laws blocking abortions violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy and self-determination. It asks that both state laws be struck down by a judge in Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The woman, a state resident identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy, is about seven weeks pregnant, the suit said. She wants to terminate her pregnancy but cannot legally do so in Kentucky, it said.",
      "The decision about whether to become or remain pregnant is among the \u201cmost personal and consequential decisions a person will make in their lifetime,\u201d the suit said. Her legal team includes attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",

      "The family of a security guard who was fatally shot at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, has sued the facility for $35 million",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The family of a security guard who was shot and killed at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, sued the facility for $35 million on Tuesday, accusing it of negligence and failing to respond to the dangers that the gunman posed to hospital staff over multiple days.",
      "In a wrongful death complaint filed Tuesday, the estate of Bobby Smallwood argued that Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center failed to enforce its policies against violence and weapons in the workplace by not barring the shooter from the facility, despite staff reporting threats and aggression toward them in the days before the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe repeated failures of Legacy Good Samaritan to follow their own safety protocols directly led to the tragically preventable death of Bobby Smallwood,\u201d Tom D\u2019Amore, the attorney representing the family, said in a statement. \u201cDespite documented threats and abusive behavior that required immediate removal under hospital policy, Legacy allowed a dangerous individual to remain on the premises for three days until those threats escalated to violence.\u201d",
      "In an email, Legacy Health said it was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The shooting at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Portland was part of a wave of gun violence sweeping through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation\u2019s most violent fields. Health care workers racked up 73% of all nonfatal workplace violence injuries in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The gunman at the Portland hospital, PoniaX Calles, first visited the facility on July 19, 2023, as his partner was about to give birth. On July 20 and July 21, nursing staff and security guards filed multiple incident reports describing outbursts, violent behavior and threats, but they weren't accessible or provided to workers who were interacting with him, according to the complaint.",
      "On July 22, nurse supervisors decided to remove Calles from his partner's room, and Smallwood accompanied him to the waiting room area outside the maternity ward. Other security guards searching the room found two loaded firearms in a duffel bag, and his partner told them he likely had a third gun on his person, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, over 40 minutes passed between the discovery of the duffel bag and Smallwood's death. Two minutes before he was shot, a security guard used hand gestures through glass doors to notify him that Calles was armed. Smallwood then told Calles he would pat him down, but Calles said he would leave instead. Smallwood began escorting him out of the hospital, and as other staff members approached them, Calles shot Smallwood in the neck.",
      "The hospital did not call a \u201ccode silver,\u201d the emergency code for an active shooter, until after Smallwood had been shot, the complaint said.",
      "Smallwood's family said his death has profoundly impacted them.",
      "\u201cEvery day we grieve the loss of our son and all the years ahead that should have been his to live,\u201d his parents, Walter \u201cBob\u201d and Tammy Smallwood, said in the statement released by their attorney. \u201cNothing can bring Bobby back, but we will not stop fighting until Legacy is held fully responsible for what they took from our family.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Legacy said it planned to install additional metal detectors; require bag searches at every hospital; equip more security officers with stun guns; and apply bullet-slowing film to some interior glass and at main entrances.",
      "Around 40 states have passed laws creating or increasing penalties for violence against health care workers, according to the American Nurses Association. Hospitals have armed security officers with batons, stun guns or handguns, while some states allow hospitals to create their own police forces."

      "NEW YORK -- A Canadian teen is hospitalized in critical condition with what is believed to be bird flu, a British Columbia health official said Tuesday.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how the teenager picked up the virus, which has been detected recently in wild birds and poultry in the province, said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. The teen is not known to have any contact with infected animals, she said.",
      "Officials have released few details about the patient. Henry said the teen was healthy before developing symptoms more than a week ago \u2014 initially eye redness, cough and fever \u2014 and has been hospitalized with a respiratory illness since Friday in Vancouver.",
      "Initial testing indicated the infection is from bird flu. Officials believe it is the Type A H5N1 bird flu but are awaiting confirmation. H5N1 has been spreading widely in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and a number of other animals. This year, 46 people in the U.S. \u2014 mostly farmworkers \u2014 have tested positive with mostly mild symptoms.",
      "In Canada, testing has been done on about three dozen people who were in contact with the teen. None of them have evidence of infection, Henry said.",
      "Officials are trying to figure out how the teen was infected, although Henry said that may never be determined. In British Columbia, the virus has been detected in poultry, wild birds and some small animals, mostly when birds are migrating through the area.",
      "The Canadian case was in the Fraser Valley area in southern British Columbia.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.",
      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\u201cWhen I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "Pakistan has shut schools until Nov. 17 in parts of Punjab as part of measures aimed at protecting children\u2019s health. Authorities on Friday ordered the closure of all parks and museums for 10 days, and they have been urging people to avoid unnecessary travel.",
      "According to the Environmental Protection Department in Punjab, Multan remained the most polluted city on Monday, with air quality index readings of about 800. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "Though the government has ordered the mandatory wearing of face masks, that has been widely disregarded. The government has also said it was looking into methods to induce artificial rainfall to combat the pollution.",

      "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A conservative prosecutor's attorney struggled Monday to persuade the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban, drawing a tongue-lashing from two of the court's liberal justices during oral arguments.",
      "Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Joel Urmanski, has asked the high court to overturn a Dane County judge\u2019s ruling last year that invalidated the ban. A ruling isn't expected for weeks but abortion advocates almost certainly will win the case given that liberal justices control the court. One of them, Janet Protasiewicz, remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Monday's two-hour session amounted to little more than political theater. Liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet told Urmanski's attorney, Matthew Thome, that the ban was passed in 1849 by white men who held all the power and that he was ignoring everything that has happened since. Jill Karofsky, another liberal justice, pointed out that the ban provides no exceptions for rape or incest and that reactivation could result in doctors withholding medical care. She told Thome that he was essentially asking the court to sign a \u201cdeath warrant\u201d for women and children in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThis is the world gone mad,\u201d Karofsky said.",
      "The ban stood until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never repealed the ban, however, and conservatives have argued the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe two years ago reactivated it.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that prohibits abortion after a fetus reaches the point where it can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Urmanski contends that the ban was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a lower appellate decision.",
      "Thome told the justices on Monday that he wasn't arguing about the implications of reactivating the ban. He maintained that the legal theory that new laws implicitly repeal old ones is shaky. He also contended that the ban and the newer abortion restrictions can overlap just like laws establishing different penalties for the same crime. A ruling that the 1985 law effectively repealed the ban would be \u201canti-democratic,\u201d Thome added.",
      "\u201cIt's a statute this Legislature has not repealed and you're saying, no, you actually repealed it,\u201d he said.",
      "Dallet shot back that disregarding laws passed over the last 40 years to go back to 1849 would be undemocratic.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The justices have agreed to take the case but haven't scheduled oral arguments yet.",

    "story": [
      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",

      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",

      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",

Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",
      "\u201cWelcome,\u201d one long-time attendee said, in a greeting that has become a regular for the group. \u201cToday, you are the most important person here.\u201d",

    "summary": "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched Supreme Court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court. A county judge in October struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted.

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union must back Ukraine against Russia for as a long as it takes and persuade the United States that its strategic interests in China are tied up in the outcome of the war, the woman nominated as the bloc\u2019s top diplomat for the next five years said Tuesday.",
      "Questions have been raised about whether the 27-nation EU\u2019s commitment to Ukraine would remain firm with Russia appearing to have an edge in the war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and following the reelection of Donald Trump, who has vowed to end the conflict as U.S. president.",
      "\u201cUkraine\u2019s victory is a priority for us all. The situation on the battlefield is very difficult,\u201d Estonia ex-Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told EU lawmakers during a hearing she must pass to be appointed as foreign policy chief.",

      "Danish police are closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Danish police said Tuesday that they were closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange, saying nothing points at the blaze being the result of a criminal act.",
      "Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, \u201cit is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,\" said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation.",
      "\u201cOur assessment is that we have explored all relevant investigative possibilities in the case,\u201d Belling told a press conference, adding that no one has been charged in the case.",
      "Belling said the video material included hours of footage from inside the Stock Exchange that had not been damaged by the fire. He added that no inflammable liquid has been found.",
      "In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the 400-year-old building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building\u2019s outer wall collapsed inwards.",
      "As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building.",
      "One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said.",
      "He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024.",
      "\u201cThere is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them. It is our opinion that they have been followed to the letter,\u201d Tim Ole Simonsen, a senior member of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, told the same news conference. \u201cThen you can discuss whether they are good enough.\u201d",
      "On Sept. 24, King Frederik X of Denmark laid the \u201cfoundation stone\u201d within part of a red brick wall that survived the mid-April blaze, marking the commencing of a yearslong reconstruction plan.",
      "The owner of the downtown exchange, the Denmark\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, has said that they will rebuild the landmark, which is considered a leading example of Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark. Construction started in 1615 and it first opened in 1624.",

It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a \u201cjust and multipolar new world order\u201d and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy.",
      "Some observers speculate the treaty\u2019s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon.",
      "According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine\u2019s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",

      "When the baby developed dark curls that made her look different from herself, Karen Rafteseth Dokken assumed she just took after her husband's mother.",
      "It took nearly six decades to discover the true reason: Rafteseth Dokken's biological daughter had been mistakenly switched at birth in the maternity ward of the hospital in central Norway.",
      "The girl she ended up raising, Mona, was not the baby she gave birth to.",
      "The babies \u2014 one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 \u2014 are now 59-year-old women who together with Rafteseth Dokken are suing the state and the municipality.",
      "In their case, which opened in the Oslo District Court on Monday, they argue that their human rights were violated when authorities discovered the error when the girls were teenagers and covered it up. They claim Norwegian authorities had undermined their right to a family life, a principle enshrined in the European human rights convention, and demand an apology and compensation.",
      "Rafteseth Dokken, now 78, was in tears as she described learning so many years later that she got the wrong baby, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.",
      "\u201cIt was never my thought that Mona was not my daughter,\" she said in court on Tuesday. \u201cShe was named Mona after my mother.\u201d",
      "Mona described a sense of never belonging as she grew up. That sense of uncertainty pushed her in 2021 to do a DNA test, which showed that she was not the biological daughter of those who raised her.",
      "But the woman who raised the other baby knew long before.",
      "A routine blood test in 1981 revealed that the girl she was raising, Linda Karin Risvik Gotaas, was not biologically related. The woman raising her, however, did not pursue a maternity case. Norwegian health authorities were informed of the mix-up in 1985, but refrained from telling the others involved.",
      "Both women who were swapped at birth have said in interviews that it was a shock to learn about the mix-up, but the knowledge made pieces of their lives fall into place, explaining differences both in terms of appearance and demeanor.",
      "Kristine Aarre Haanes, representing Mona, said the state \u201cviolated her right to her own identity for all these years. They kept it secret.\u201d",

      "\u201cHer biological father has died. She has no contact with her biological mother,\u201d added Aarre Haanes.",
      "Circumstances surrounding the 1965 swap at Eggesboenes hospital are unclear, but media reports by NRK suggest there were several cases during the 1950s and 1960s where children were accidentally swapped at the same institution. At the time babies were kept together while their mothers rested in separate rooms.",
      "In other cases the errors were spotted before the children were permanently placed with the wrong families, according to the reports.",
      "An official from the Norwegian Ministry of Heath and Care Services said the state was unaware of similar cases and that there were no plans for a public inquiry.",
      "Asgeir Nygaard, representing the Norwegian state, is fighting the case on the grounds that the 1965 switch took place in a private institution and that the health directorate in the 1980s did not have the legal authority to inform the other families when they discovered the error.",
      "\u201cDocumentation from that time indicates that government officials found the assessments difficult, inter alia because it was legally unclear what they could do,\u201d he wrote in a statement to The Associated Press ahead of the trial's opening. \u201cTherefore, in court, we will argue that there is no basis for compensation and that the claims being made are in any case statute-barred.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Defense Department says Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels targeted two U.S. Navy warships with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait on Tuesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted two U.S. Navy warships with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful, the Defense Department said Tuesday.",
      "Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said the Iranian-backed Houthis launched at least eight drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles and three anti-ship cruise missiles at the USS Stockdale and the USS Spruance, both Navy destroyers, on Monday. He said there was no damage and no one was injured.",
      "The incoming fires \u201cwere successfully engaged,\u201d Ryder said.",
      "The strait is a narrow waterway between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year. The rebels have been targeting shipping through the strait for months over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel's ground offensive in Lebanon.",
      "In response, U.S. and partnered forces have launched multiple rounds of coordinated airstrikes against Houthi launch sites and weapons storage sites, and the U.S. organized an international coalition to help provide protection to commercial vessels as they transited \u2014 but it has not stopped the Houthi attacks.",
      "The Houthis have insisted that the attacks will continue as long as the wars go on, and the assaults already have halved shipping through the region. Meanwhile, a U.N. panel of experts now alleges that the Houthis may be shaking down some shippers for about $180 million a month for safe passage through the area.",
      "Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree in a prerecorded statement earlier Tuesday had claimed the rebels attacked two American destroyers in the Red Sea with ballistic missiles and drones.",

      "No one was wounded on board in the blasts, and the ship was continuing on its journey, the UKMTO added.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if the UKMTO report was directly linked to the attacks on the U.S. destroyers, but similar incidents of rebel fire coming near other ships have happened before.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well.",
      "The last Houthi maritime attack came Oct. 28 and targeted the Liberian-flagged bulk tanker Motaro. Before that, an Oct. 10 attack targeted the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker Olympic Spirit.",
      "It's unclear why the Houthis' attacks have dropped, though they have launched multiple missiles toward Israel as well. On Oct. 17, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the rebels. U.S. airstrikes also have been targeting Houthi positions in recent days as well.",

      "The European Union says it will not renew a fishing agreement with Senegal that has been criticized by many Senegalese",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- The European Union will not renew a fishing agreement with Senegal that has been criticized by many Senegalese, the EU delegation in the West African country announced Tuesday.",
      "The decision comes after the EU identified Senegal as a \u201cnon-cooperating country\" in the fight against illegal fishing earlier this year, citing \"failures in monitoring, control and surveillance systems\" on Senegalese ships in extraterritorial waters as well as on foreign vessels in the port of Dakar, the capital.",
      "\u201cAwaiting encouraging developments, the agreement between the EU and Senegal will not be renewed,\u201d the statement said.

      "The renegotiation of the EU-Senegal fishing agreement was a key campaign promise of Senegal's President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was elected in March. In May, he announced an audit of the fishing sector and of the EU-Senegal agreement. The results have not been released."

      "The Biden administration says Israel has made some good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and therefore it will not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago if the situation had not improved",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration said Tuesday that Israel has made some good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and will not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago if the situation had not improved. Relief groups say conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war.",
      "State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters the progress to date must be supplemented and sustained but \u201cwe, at this time, have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law.\" It requires recipients of military assistance to adhere to international humanitarian law and not impede the provision of such aid.",
      "\u201cWe are not giving Israel a pass,\u201d Patel said, adding that the steps Israel has taken have not yet made a significant enough difference. \u201cWe want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve, and we think some of these steps will allow the conditions for that to continue to progress.\u201d",

Even after the Israeli military gave permission for a delivery to the northernmost part of Gaza \u2014 virtually cut off from food for more than a month by an Israeli siege \u2014 the United Nations said it couldn't deliver most of it because of turmoil and restrictions from Israeli troops on the ground.",
      "In the south, hundreds of truckloads of aid are sitting on the Gaza side of the border because the U.N. says it cannot reach them to distribute the aid \u2014 again because of the threat of lawlessness, theft and Israeli military restrictions.",

It connected electricity for a desalination plant in Deir al-Balah. But the effect was unclear.",
      "Israel\u2019s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters Monday he was confident \u201cthe issue would be solved.\u201d The Biden administration may have less leverage after Donald Trump \u2014 a staunch supporter of Israel \u2014 won the presidential election.",

      "President Joe Biden met Tuesday at the White House with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, but they didn't speak publicly about the aid issue.

      "The report listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, saying Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. It was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children.",
      "In an Oct. 13 letter, the U.S. gave Israel 30 days, among other things, to allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing; allow people in coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.",

      "COGAT \u2014 the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2014 said Tuesday it allowed a new delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun a day earlier. The WFP said that while it tried to send 14 trucks, only three made it to the town \u201cdue to delays in receiving authorization for movement and crowds along the route.\u201d When it tried to deliver the rest Tuesday, Israel denied it permission, it said.",
      "Aid into all of Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, only a third of the previous month, according to Israeli data.",
      "U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through because of Israeli restrictions, fighting and lawlessness that make it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side.",
      "In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel\u2019s official figures. The U.N. says it only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October.",

      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don\u2019t say how many of those were militants but that more than half are women and children. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities.",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent.",
      "Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who apparently was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv\u2019s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war.",

      "Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her.",
      "Her defense argued the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial.",
      "In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was \u201cpainful\u201d to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down.",
      "\u201cA doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child\u2019s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this -- and of the words that I allegedly said to them,\u201d Mediazona quoted her as saying.",
      "Buyanova's case drew national attention, with more than 6,500 people signing an online petition demanding her freedom and supporters regularly attending court hearings. As the judge read out the verdict, they shouted, \u201cDisgrace!\u201d before bailiffs escorted everyone from the courtroom.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",

      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",

      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has survived a runoff vote against the opposition but will face turmoil ahead amid anger over the ruling party\u2019s financial scandals",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, battered in parliamentary elections last month, has survived a rare runoff vote against the opposition to remain the country's leader but he still faces turmoil ahead.",
      "One of his top priorities is dealing with the aftermath of a major corruption scandal in the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which dozens of lawmakers from the party are alleged to have pocketed profits from event ticket sales as kickbacks.",
      "Ishiba also now has a much-emboldened opposition eager to push through policies long stymied by the LDP. Support ratings for his Cabinet have fallen to about 30%.",
      "Here is a look at what's happening in Japan's tumultuous politics, and what it might mean for Ishiba and his government as they prepare to navigate a second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "A parliamentary vote for a new leader is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past that was mostly ignored as the head of the LDP usually enjoyed a majority in the Lower House, the more powerful of Japan\u2019s two-chamber parliament.",
      "This time, though, because Ishiba's LDP and its junior coalition partner lost its majority in the recent election, the runoff on Monday couldn't be avoided \u2014 the first in 30 years.",
      "Opposition's top leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has noted that nearly half of all lower house steering committees are now headed by the opposition. That\u2019s a huge change from the pre-election domination of the LDP, which controlled all but three of the 27 committees.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have a new landscape in Japanese politics,\u201d Noda said.",
      "Twelve of the committees in key areas, including budget, political reforms, national security and legal affairs, will be headed by Noda\u2019s Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and two other main opposition groups.",
      "What's certain is that the era of LDP\u2019s one-sided rule is over, for now, and the opposition has a chance to achieve policies long opposed by the ruling conservatives, including on issues like gender equality and diversity.",
      "Noda said last Friday that a legal committee now headed by his party\u2019s gender equality chief, Chinami Nishimura, is aiming to achieve a civil code revision to allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames. That change has been stalled by LDP conservatives for 30 years, despite widespread support by the public and a United Nations panel on discrimination against women.",
      "Yuichiro Tamaki is head of the conservative Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats to 28 in the election. The vote elevated his party from a fringe group to a major player.",
      "He is now being cast as a potential key to Ishiba\u2019s survival.",
      "A Harvard-educated former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, the 55-year-old Tamaki has seen success by pushing for the raising of a basic tax-free income allowance and an increase of take-home wages. His messages on social media have appealed to younger voters, who have long been ignored by LDP policies catering to conservative elderly.",
      "Ishiba apparently seems to find Tamaki\u2019s 28-member DPP an attractive partner to secure a majority. The two parties, which have common ground in some areas \u2014 including support for greater nuclear energy use and a stronger military \u2014 have started policy talks.",
      "Ishiba met with both Tamaki and Noda on Monday but Tamaki may be cautious about moving too close to a scandal-plagued LDP ahead of another election next year. Noda is struggling to form a unified opposition to force a change of government, which he says is his next goal.",
      "For Ishiba, the \u201chung parliament\u201d requires him to win over opposition forces so he can push his policies. While considered unstable, it might also provide a chance for a more consensus-based policy making process, experts say.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking the current situation positively as a chance to get our opposition voice heard more carefully,\u201d Tamaki said.",
      "Ishiba also faces challenges of restoring unity in his own party. A number of senior LDP lawmakers are waiting to overthrow Ishiba, though their priority is to resolidify their footholds, not infighting \u2014 and nobody is eager to do damage control at this difficult time anyway.",
      "\u201cThe (Ishiba) administration is quite unstable. ... He will have to get opposition parties' cooperation every time he wants to get a bill approved, which could stall policies,\u201d said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama.",
      "And even if Ishiba survives politically in the coming months, there could be a call for his replacement ahead of next elections.",
      "\u201cJapan is likely to return to a period of short-lived government,\u201d Uchiyama said.",
      "Ishiba congratulated Trump hours after his victory and in a brief telephone conversation, they agreed to closely work together to further elevate their alliance.",
      "While experts say Trump understands the importance of U.S.-Japan relations, he may \u2014 as he did in his first administration \u2014 pressure Japan to pay more for the cost of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan or to buy more expensive American weapons.",
      "Trump's possible tariff proposals could also hurt Japanese exporters.",
      "Ishiba on Saturday renewed his pledge to pursue an ongoing military buildup plan under a strategy that calls for a counter-strike capability with long-range cruise-missiles. He has long advocated a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance but could face difficulty pursuing those plans.",
      "\u201dIt will be a fantastic experiment to see if a national unity government can get Japan through until the next election,\u201d said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",

      "Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at ...",
      "LONDON -- Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.",
      "Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when the archbishop\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his failure to report the abuse in England and in Africa in 2013 kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. By Tuesday afternoon, Welby acknowledged that mistake.",
      "\u201cIt is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,\u201d Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. \u201cI believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve.\u201d",
      "Welby\u2019s resignation will send ripples around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries, including the Episcopal Church in the United States. While each national church has its own leaders, the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals.",
      "Welby, a former oil executive who left the industry in 1989 to study for the priesthood, was a controversial figure even before the scandal. A skilled mediator who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, he struggled to unite the Anglican Communion, which has been riven by sharply divergent views on issues such as gay rights and the place of women in the church.",
      "The Church of England on Thursday released the results of an independent investigation into the late John Smyth, a prominent attorney who the report said sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa from the 1970s until his death in 2018.",
      "The 251-page report of the Makin Review concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many victims could have been spared the abuse, the inquiry found.",
      "Welby said he didn\u2019t inform law enforcement agencies about the abuse because he was wrongly told that police were already investigating. Even so, he took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been.",
      "As late as Monday, Welby\u2019s office said he had decided not to resign, even as he expressed his \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d",
      "Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Welby\u2019s position had become \u201cuntenable\u201d after some members of the General Synod, the Church of England\u2019s national assembly, started a petition calling on him to step down because he had \u201clost the confidence of his clergy.\u201d",
      "But the strongest outcry came from Smyth\u2019s victims. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over five years, said resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the church\u2019s broader handling of historical abuse cases.",
      "\u201cI believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign,\u2019\u2019 Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down.",
      "Welby\u2019s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England \u201ca place where abusers could hide.\u201d",
      "Welby\u2019s supporters had argued that he should remain on the job because of his role in changing the culture of the church.",
      "Church officials were first made aware of Smyth\u2019s abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into complaints about his behavior at Christian summer camps in England. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa. He abused boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018, the investigation found.",
      "Smyth\u2019s actions weren't made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television station, which led police in Hampshire to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.",
      "Stephen Cherry, dean of the chapel at King\u2019s College Cambridge, said Welby could no longer represent the people.",
      "\u201cThere are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment publicly,\u2019\u2019 Cherry told the BBC before Welby resigned.",
      "\u201cAnd the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office.\u201d",

      "Costa Rica has bestowed its highest diplomatic honor on visiting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for his success in lowering levels of violence during a more than two-year campaign against powerful street gangs",
      "SAN JOSE, Costa Rica -- Costa Rica on Monday bestowed its highest diplomatic honor on El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for his success in lowering levels of violence during a more than two-year campaign against powerful street gangs.",
      "President Rodrigo Chaves lauded Bukele\u2019s efforts as his own country continues to struggle with historically high homicide numbers. Yet Bukele\u2019s recognition brought controversy in Costa Rica, long known as Central America\u2019s most stable democracy.",
      "Bukele's success in combating violence is due in part to the suspension of a number of constitutional rights that push aside due process and give security forces and prosecutors far greater power to pursue suspects. Despite that, voters rewarded Bukele with an unprecedented second term earlier this year and he maintains stratospheric approval levels.",
      "Unlike Bukele, Chaves does not hold a majority in congress and has not remade Costa Rica\u2019s courts to remove opposition. Chaves has spoken in half jest about leaving the presidency to run for congress and then trying for the presidency again. Costa Rica does not allow consecutive presidential reelection.",
      "The country \u2014 long applauded for a robust ecotourism industry, environmental conservation and relative peace \u2014 has been wracked by violence in recent years, largely attributed to drug trafficking. Costa Rica has become a key way station for cocaine exports to Europe and the United States.",
      "Last year, Costa Rica hit a homicide record with 906, compared to 654 in 2022. This year is only slightly off last year\u2019s pace, according to the government. On Tuesday, the two leaders were scheduled to visit one of Costa Rica\u2019s largest prisons.",
      "\u201cEl Salvador\u2019s rescue from those nefarious claws is also helping the peace in our region,\u201d Chaves said Monday after giving Bukele the National Order of Juan Mora Fern\u00e1ndez, named after the country\u2019s first president. \u201cThe fight against organized crime in any part of Central America is welcome. The reach and influence and bad example of the gangs must be reduced.\u201d",
      "Chaves, a conservative economist, ran an outsider\u2019s campaign in 2022 despite having briefly served as finance minister in the administration of outgoing President Carlos Alvarado. He has maintained high levels of approval, but covets the legislative majority ushered into office by Bukele\u2019s early popularity.",
      "\u201cPresident Bukele also understands what I have said a thousand times in this country, that for democracy to be worthwhile, it has to give results to society, to not be replaced by another political system that we Costa Ricans don\u2019t want to see.\u201d",
      "Bukele addressed criticism of his methods as he has before. He said first the right to life must be protected by addressing violence before other rights can be guaranteed.",
      "\u201cAll the other rights aren\u2019t worth it if there\u2019s no right to life. They can\u2019t be applied. There\u2019s no right to (free) movement if I\u2019m dead,\u201d Bukele said. \u201cSo the government must guarantee citizens\u2019 right to life and to do so has to go after the criminals. There\u2019s no other way.\u201d",

      "Welby stepped down after an independent investigation found that he had failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.",
      "Here are the answers to some questions about the Church of England, Welby\u2019s decision and its global significance.",
      "The Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, is a Christian denomination and the official church of England. It was created in the 16th century when the English church broke away from the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "The church is part of the global Anglican Communion, a family of churches that has over 85 million members in more than 165 countries. Britain\u2019s monarch is the supreme governor of the Church of England and has the power to appoint bishops and other church leaders.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is traditionally seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion. Each of the 46 churches that comprise the Anglican Communion has its own primate, but the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals.",
      "Justin Welby, 68, was the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury. He worked in the oil industry for 11 years before he left in 1989 to study for the priesthood.",
      "Welby was ordained in 1992 and worked extensively in Africa and the Middle East before he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013. Though a skilled mediator \u2014 who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa \u2014 he struggled to unite the global Anglican Communion.",
      "Like many Christian denominations, the Anglicans are split by disagreements over the church\u2019s teachings about homosexuality and the role of women. While churches in England and America have become more welcoming to the LGBT community and moved to ordain women priests and bishops, some more conservative churches in Africa and Asia have resisted those changes. Those divisions have weakened the Archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s influence in the Anglican Communion.",
      "An independent investigation last week released its long-awaited report into the late John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused more than 100 boys and young men at Christian summer camps in the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe and South Africa over five decades.",
      "The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many of his victims wouldn\u2019t have been abused, the report found.",
      "Welby initially refused to resign, saying he was wrongly informed that police had already been notified and he shouldn\u2019t do anything to interfere with their investigation. But his position became untenable after a growing number of church leaders and victims criticized him for failing to take responsibility for the scandal.",
      "\u201cIt is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,\u201d Welby said, announcing his resignation.",
      "Yes. Like the Catholic Church, the Church of England has faced a long series of allegations that priests and others affiliated with the church used their positions to abuse young men and women.",
      "An independent inquiry established by the government found that 390 people associated with the church were convicted of child sexual abuse between the 1940s and 2018. Deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England \u201ca place where abusers could hide,\u201d the inquiry found.",
      "Welby\u2019s supporters said he was instrumental in changing the culture of the church and improving its safeguarding procedures after he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013.",
      "The process of selecting Welby\u2019s successor will begin with the Crown Nominations Commission, which nominates candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishoprics in England. The commission will send the name of a preferred candidate and an alternate to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will then advise King Charles III on his selection.",
      "The commission has 16 members, including the Archbishop of York, representatives of the clergy and laypeople, a representative of the Anglican Communion and a chair appointed by the prime minister."

      "French farmers have protested against a trade deal that would increase agricultural imports from South America, saying it hurt their livelihoods",
      "PARIS -- French farmers protested Tuesday against a trade deal that would increase agricultural imports from South America, saying it hurt their livelihoods.",
      "The European Union and the Mercosur trade bloc, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, reached an initial agreement in 2019, but negotiations stumbled due to opposition from farmers, and some European governments, leading to sweeping rallies where they particularly expressed worry about the use of pesticides in South American produce.",
      "Tuesday's protest in Aurillac, in southern France, was the start of a fresh wave expected to spread among the European agricultural community amid concern that the deal could be finalized at the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 18-19 despite the French minister of agriculture, Annie Genevard, saying it was \u201chighly unlikely.\"",
      "A group of more than 600 French lawmakers also published an open letter in Le Monde, telling the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that the conditions for adopting an agreement with the Mercosur bloc \u201chave not been met.\"",
      "Last week, French protesters blocked the state building in the western commune of Niort, while on Monday, the Copa-Cogeca European farmers\u2019 group sent a letter to von der Leyen, urging her to reject the Mercosur deal and adopt \u201ca coherent trade policy\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, France's three biggest farming unions have vowed action: The FNSEA, France\u2019s largest, has called for nationwide protests once the winter sowing season ends in mid-November. Coordination Rurale has promised \u201can agricultural revolt\u201d starting on Nov. 19 in Auch and Agen, two cities in the Southwest of France, while the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, the third-largest union, known for its anti-globalization stance, is also planning its move against \u201cfree trade agreements.\u201d",
      "Farmers in Belgium have also called for demonstrations close to the EU headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.",
      "European farmers' apprehensions stem from what they say are the too-strict EU environmental regulations they follow while the Mercosur deal could flood the market with imports from South America which are produced under lower environmental and labor standards, according to V\u00e9ronique Le Floc\u2019h, the president of Coordination Rurale, France\u2019s second-largest farmers\u2019 union.",
      "\u201cThe anger hasn\u2019t gone away. It\u2019s still there, and, in fact, our worries have grown,\u201d said Le Floc'h whose organization has been linked to France's far-right party National Rally. \u201cIf the Mercosur agreement is signed, it will spell the end of our agriculture,\u201d she said.",
      "Genevard, the agriculture minister, reiterated the government\u2019s opposition to the deal on Tuesday. In an interview with TF1, she said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want this agreement because it\u2019s harmful. It will bring in products, including substances banned in Europe, at the cost of deforestation. It will unfairly compete with our domestic production.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen the minister says the agreement won\u2019t be signed, she\u2019s either naive or thinks we are,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should we believe her when so many countries are in favor of it?\u201d",
      "In March, French President Emmanuel Macron called the deal \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201coutdated.\" Negotiations began on June 28, 1999, but have taken a long, torturous path since.",

      "BERLIN -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is expected to ask for a vote of confidence in his government on Dec. 16, paving the way for a new parliamentary election as early as February, German media reported Tuesday.",
      "The expected vote in the Bundestag would come well ahead of original plans, marking a step to reach compromise between Scholz's party, the Social Democrats, and the main opposition party in parliament, the center-right Christian conservatives.",
      "The move comes after the collapse of Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition last week, at a time when the leaders of Europe's biggest economy have been grappling with ways to revive Germany's anemic economic growth.",
      "Experts predict the economy will shrink or at best stagnate this year, due to external shocks and homegrown problems including red tape and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "Scholz had previously announced that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that could lead to an election as soon as March. The vote had otherwise been due next September.",

    "story": [
      "Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule announced by the Biden administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane \u2014 the primary component of natural gas \u2014 and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, announced at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes a day after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Joe Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule will not become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden\u2019s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\u201d he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry\u2019s largest lobbying group, said the fee \u201champers our ability to meet the growing energy needs of American families and businesses and fails to advance meaningful emissions reduction.\"",
      "API senior vice president Dustin Meyer said the group looks forward to working with the Trump administration and the new Congress to repeal the fee and \u201cget this right.\"",
      "Environmental groups hailed the new fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it\u2019s cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "\u201cWhile we expect the next administration to recklessly greenlight fossil fuel extraction, it\u2019s heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,\u201d said Maggie Coulter, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, an advocacy group.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction,\" Coulter said. \u201cThe oil and gas companies doing so much damage to our climate should have to pay for the methane leaks they\u2019ve so outrageously failed to fix.\u201d"

      "Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy and markets",
      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy.",
      "Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they\u2019ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs.",
      "Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else.",
      "\u2014 Stan Choe",
      "Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment:",
      "Technology stocks soared in Trump\u2019s first term, helped by the administration\u2019s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump\u2019s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry\u2019s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains.",
      "This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What\u2019s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology \u2014 an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China.",
      "Trump\u2019s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern.",
      "Still, in a sign of tech\u2019s more conciliatory attitude, Trump\u2019s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry\u2019s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "\u2014 Michael Liedtke",
      "Trump\u2019s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry.",
      "Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said.",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He\u2019s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices.",
      "As opposed to Trump\u2019s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said.",
      "Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.",
      "The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump\u2019s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men\u2019s jeans would cost $90 to $96.",
      "\u2014 Anne D'Innocenzio",
      "Trump has said he wants to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it\u2019s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged.",
      "Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry.",
      "But remember Trump\u2019s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall.",
      "Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government\u2019s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted.",
      "A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies.",
      "The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.",
      "Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar.",
      "In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops.",
      "\u2014 Tom Murphy",
      "The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs.",
      "Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines.",
      "Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group.",
      "Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern.",
      "Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM\u2019s North American production comes from Mexico, while it\u2019s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford.",
      "Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can\u2019t afford the current average price of over $47,000.",
      "Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs.",
      "\u2014 Tom Krisher",
      "Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a \u201cnew era\u201d of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back.",
      "Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones.",
      "\u2014 Paul Harloff",
      "Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus.",
      "Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete.",
      "But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies.",
      "Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has surged above $86,000. Shares of crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 60% since the election.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "Questions have been raised about whether the 27-nation EU\u2019s commitment to Ukraine would remain firm with Russia appearing to have an edge in the war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and following the reelection of Donald Trump, who has vowed to end the conflict as U.S. president.",

    "story": [
      "A Dutch appeals court has overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, while saying that \"protection against dangerous climate change is a human right.\u201d",
      "The decision was a defeat for the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups, which had hailed the original 2021 ruling as a victory for the climate. Tuesday's civil ruling can be appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis hurts,\u201d Friends of the Earth director in the Netherlands Donald Pols said. \u201cAt the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\u201d",
      "Outside court, Pols said the fight against climate change \u201cis a marathon, not a sprint, and the race has just begun.\u201d",
      "The ruling upholding Shell\u2019s appeal came as a 12-day U.N. climate conference was entering its second day in Azerbaijan where countries are discussing how to fund cutting planet-warming emissions and adapt to ever-increasing weather extremes.",
      "It marked a stinging defeat for climate activists after several courtroom victories. A court in The Hague in 2015 ordered the government to cut emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels. The Dutch Supreme Court upheld the ruling five years ago.",
      "Earlier this year, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that countries are legally required to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and said that countries must take steps to mitigate and adapt to their adverse effects.",
      "And in April, Europe\u2019s highest human rights court ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change.",
      "In December the top U.N. legal body, the International Court of Justice, is holding public hearings on climate change after the world body requested a nonbinding advisory opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d Dozens of countries are set to present arguments at two weeks of hearings.",
      "In a written summary of Tuesday's ruling, the court said that Shell has a duty of care to limit its emissions, but it annulled the lower court's decision because it was \u201cunable to establish that the social standard of care entails an obligation for Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45%, or some other percentage.",
      "\"There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere.\u201d",
      "Shell has emitted 36,528 million tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, since 1854, which is 2.1% of global emissions, according to an April report by the Carbon Majors Database.",
      "Presiding Judge Carla Joustra said that Shell already has targets for climate-warming carbon emissions that are in line with demands of Friends of the Earth \u2014 both for what it directly produces and for emissions produced by energy the company purchase from others.",
      "The court then ruled that \u201cfor Shell to reduce CO2 emissions caused by buyers of Shell products ... by a particular percentage would be ineffective in this case. Shell could meet that obligation by ceasing to trade in the fuels it purchases from third parties. Other companies would then take over that trade.\u201d",
      "Joustra said that, \u201cThe court\u2019s final judgment is that Friends of the Earth's claims cannot be granted. The court therefore annuls the district court\u2019s judgment.\u201d",
      "Climate activists sitting outside on the courthouse steps hugged, and some appeared close to tears after the decision.",
      "\u201cTo be honest I was just really disappointed,\" Neele Boelens said. I was almost crying. I was in there in the court and it was just like... At first it looked really good for us but then it just went down hill.\"",
      "Shell, meanwhile, welcomed the ruling.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company,\u201d Shell plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said in a written statement. \u201cOur target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell\u2019s strategy and is transforming our business.\"",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

      "After years as an also-ran, the pastel-colored ponies were enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame on Tuesday, along with Transformers action figures and the Phase 10 card game.",
      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\u201cThese are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\u201d Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \u201cBut for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\u201d",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \u201ccutie marks\u201d on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\u201cThe My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children\u2019s fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \u201cThe variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\u201d",
      "Phase 10 was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur Ken Johnson in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\u201d said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids\u2019 imaginations and fantasy play.\u201d",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise."

      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "His death was announced by Motor Oil Hellas, the petroleum company Vardinoyannis transformed into one of Greece\u2019s largest corporations.",
      "Born on the island of Crete, the fifth of eight children, Vardinoyannis embodied the archetype of the Greek shipping magnate who became a powerbroker at the head of one of the country\u2019s most influential families.",
      "After graduating from the naval academy in 1955, he served as an officer until his forced retirement and exile on a then remote Greek island due to his opposition to the military dictatorship that governed the country from 1967 to 1974.",
      "Vardinoyannis joined the family business in the early 1970s, and began building an extensive network of enterprises that eventually included shipping, banking, hotels, sports clubs, newspapers and national television networks.",

      "In 1990, Vardinoyannis survived an assassination attempt by the November 17 far-left militant group, when a car containing explosives, smoke bombs and anti-tank rocket launchers was used to target his moving armored car. The group\u2019s members were eventually rounded up and convicted 13 years later for multiple and deadly attacks against politicians, U.S. officials, and local business leaders.",
      "Vardinoyannis\u2019 financial and political influence grew after he forged a partnership with Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco in the mid-1990s, as Greece gained prosperity as a member of the European Union after decades of hardship and political instability.",

      "Later in life, Vardinoyannis became closely involved in charity projects with his wife, who was a UNESCO goodwill ambassador and head of a children's cancer charity.",

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz says it's no longer serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools",
      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",
      "The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese."

      "A U.S. jury has awarded $42 million to three former detainees of Iraq\u2019s notorious Abu Ghraib prison, holding a Virginia-based military contractor responsible for contributing to their torture and mistreatment two decades ago",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A U.S. jury on Tuesday awarded $42 million to three former detainees of Iraq's notorious Abu Ghraib prison, holding a Virginia-based military contractor responsible for contributing to their torture and mistreatment two decades ago.",
      "The decision from the eight-person jury came after a different jury earlier this year couldn't agree on whether Reston, Virginia-based CACI should be held liable for the work of its civilian interrogators who worked alongside the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib in 2003 and 2004.",
      "The jury awarded plaintiffs Suhail Al Shimari, Salah Al-Ejaili and Asa\u2019ad Al-Zubae $3 million each in compensatory damages and $11 million each in punitive damages.",
      "The three testified that they were subjected to beatings, sexual abuse, forced nudity and other cruel treatment at the prison.",
      "They did not allege that CACI's interrogators explicitly inflicted the abuse themselves, but argued CACI was complicit because its interrogators conspired with military police to \u201csoften up\u201d detainees for questioning with harsh treatment.",
      "CACI issued a statement expressing its disappointment in the verdict and its intention to appeal.",
      "\u201cFor nearly two decades, CACI has been wrongly subjected to long-term, negative affiliation with the unfortunate and reckless actions of a group of military police at Abu Ghraib prison from 2003 through 2004,\u201d the company said. \u201cTo be clear: no CACI employee has ever been charged \u2014 criminally, civilly, or administratively \u2014 in this matter. CACI employees did not take part in nor were any of our employees responsible for these disturbing events.\u201d",
      "Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the lawsuit on the plaintiffs' behalf, called the verdict \u201can important measure of Justice and accountability\u201d and praised the three plaintiffs for their resilience.",
      "The $42 million fully matches the amount sought by the plaintiffs, Azmy said. It's also more than the $31 million that the plaintiffs said CACI was paid to supply interrogators to Abu Ghraib.",
      "\u201cToday is a big day for me and for justice,\u201d said Al-Ejaili, a journalist, in a written statement. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for this day. This victory isn\u2019t only for the three plaintiffs in this case against a corporation. This victory is a shining light for everyone who has been oppressed and a strong warning to any company or contractor practicing different forms of torture and abuse.\u201d",
      "Al-Ejaili traveled to the U.S. for both trials to testify in person. The other two plaintiffs testified by video from Iraq.",
      "The trial and subsequent retrial were the first time a U.S. jury heard claims brought by Abu Ghraib survivors in the 20 years since photos of detainee mistreatment \u2014 accompanied by smiling U.S. soldiers inflicting the abuse \u2014 shocked the world during the U.S. occupation of Iraq.",
      "None of the three plaintiffs were in any of the notorious photos shown in news reports around the world, but they described treatment very similar to what was depicted.",
      "Al Shimari described sexual assaults and beatings during his two months at the prison. He also said he was electrically shocked and dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck. Al-Ejaili said he was subjected to stress positions that caused him to vomit black liquid. He was also deprived of sleep, forced to wear women\u2019s underwear and threatened with dogs.",
      "CACI had argued it wasn\u2019t complicit in the detainees\u2019 abuse. It said its employees had minimal interaction with the three plaintiffs in the case, and CACI questioned parts of the plaintiffs' stories, saying that military records contradict some of their claims and suggesting they shaded their stories to support a case against the contractor. Fundamentally, though, CACI argued that any liability for their mistreatment belonged to the government.",
      "As in the first trial, the jury struggled to decide whether CACI or the Army should be held responsible for any misconduct by CACI interrogators. The jury asked questions in its deliberations in both cases about whether the contractor or the Army bore liability.",
      "In the first trial, which ended with a mistrial and hung jury, multiple jurors told The Associated Press that a majority wanted to hold CACI liable.",
      "CACI, as one of its defenses, argued it shouldn\u2019t be liable for any misdeeds by its employees if they were under the control and direction of the Army. under a legal principle known as the \u201cborrowed servants\u201d doctrine.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that CACI was responsible for its own employees' misdeeds. They said provisions in CACI\u2019s contract with the Army, as well as the Army Field Manual, make clear that CACI is responsible for overseeing its own workers.",
      "The lawsuit was first filed in 2008 but was delayed by 15 years of legal wrangling and multiple attempts by CACI to have the case dismissed.",
      "Lawyers for the three plaintiffs argued that CACI was liable for their mistreatment even if they couldn\u2019t prove that CACI\u2019s interrogators were the ones who directly inflicted the abuse.",
      "Evidence included reports from two retired Army generals, who documented the abuse and concluded that multiple CACI interrogators were complicit in the abuse.",
      "Those reports concluded that one of the interrogators, Steven Stefanowicz, lied to investigators about his conduct and that he likely instructed soldiers to mistreat detainees and used dogs to intimidate detainees during interrogations.",
      "Stefanowicz testified for CACI at trial through a recorded video deposition and denied mistreating detainees.",
      "CACI introduced a different report that concluded contractors like CACI did a \u201csatisfactory\u201d job of complying with military procedures."

      "Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, \u201cit is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,\" said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation.",

      "In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the 400-year-old building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building\u2019s outer wall collapsed inwards.",
      "As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building.",
      "One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said.",
      "He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024.",
      "\u201cThere is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them. It is our opinion that they have been followed to the letter,\u201d Tim Ole Simonsen, a senior member of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, told the same news conference. \u201cThen you can discuss whether they are good enough.\u201d",

I did a lot of interviews and I was with a few guys in Vegas who made it (last year for the tournament's final four) and didn\u2019t understand it. They didn\u2019t even know how they got there. Now, I think everybody kind of understands it.\u201d",
      "Teams are in a group of five, play the other four teams once, and the six group winners along with two wild-cards go to the quarterfinals. Win that, and you go to Las Vegas for the semifinals. Indiana made the final last year and it's more than reasonable to say the Pacers learned something from that experience that helped propel them to the East finals last spring.",
      "\u201cOur guys got a real taste of what the elevated stage is all about,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said at the time.",
      "The Pacers entered Monday third in the East, but they lost James Wiseman and Isaiah Jackson to Achilles tendon tears early in the season, and now are without Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard.",
      "Nobody, it seems, is safe from the injury bug. Not even the Cavs, who have gotten off to their red-hot start with Max Strus out since the preseason with a sprained ankle.",
      "But they have more than endured, and other teams have found ways to get through being short-handed as well. Boston, for example, just played four games without Jaylen Brown; the defending NBA champions, to no one's surprise, are off to a 9-2 start. Other than the Celtics and Cavs, every team in the East starts play Tuesday at .500 or worse.",
      "The Magic haven't been the same without Banchero. It'll be a test for the Thunder to remain near the top of the West without Holmgren. Those coaches \u2014 Orlando's Jamahl Mosley and Oklahoma City's Mark Daigneault \u2014 see the absences of their young stars as opportunities for others to grow into evolved roles.",
      "But nobody wants to dig too deep a hole, either. It's early, but what happens now might be the difference for some teams when it's time to fight for seeding in April.",

      "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Anthony Davis says he has recovered from being poked in the left eye by Toronto's Jakob Poeltl, and his latest eye injury still hasn't persuaded him to wear protective goggles.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers ' star big man said Tuesday that he will play Wednesday night against Memphis. Davis brushed off the potential impact of the injury, even though his left eye was noticeably discolored and red after practice at the Lakers' training complex.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll go about my day and do what I need to do,\u201d Davis said. \u201cNext up is getting more sleep.\u201d",
      "Davis said he has \u201cno idea\u201d if his latest injury is another corneal abrasion. He had that injury last March after getting poked in a game against Golden State but didn't miss any time.",
      "\u201cA couple of scratches in my eye,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAs far as the medical term and all that, I\u2019m not 100% sure, but I\u2019m cleared to play.\u201d",
      "Each time Davis gets poked in the face by opponents, the nine-time All-Star is asked whether he will consider wearing goggles or protective glasses like similarly dominant big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Amare Stoudemire. Before the usual question was even completed Tuesday, Davis replied: \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to, and the doctor said I didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Davis said. \u201cNow if it gets to a point where doctor orders are to (wear goggles), then of course I will.\u201d",
      "Davis wore goggles for about three years as a blue-chip high school prospect. He tried wearing goggles again briefly during the Lakers' championship run in the Florida pandemic bubble in 2020 but quickly gave up.",
      "Davis got hurt midway through the third quarter against Toronto on Sunday night while making a sensational one-handed block of a dunk attempt by Poeltl, who accidentally clocked Davis in the face with his off hand. Davis didn't return to the game, but the Lakers still surged to a 123-103 victory over the Raptors.",
      "Davis is off to an outstanding start to the regular season, sparking early MVP talk for the 31-year-old. He is second in the NBA with 31.2 points per game, along with 10.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 2.0 blocks for the Lakers (6-4).",
      "Davis' backup is Jaxson Hayes, who had a season-high 12 points against Toronto. But the Lakers are thin at center in the continuing absence of Christian Wood, who had a recent setback in his recovery from left knee surgery.",
      "Lakers coach JJ Redick said Wood had soreness in his knee while returning to workouts in recent days. Wood has been sidelined for two months.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to scale him back,\u201d Redick said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an update in about four weeks.\u201d",

      "John Robinson has died at 89",
      "LOS ANGELES -- John Robinson, the veteran football coach who enjoyed many years of success at the University of Southern California and with the Los Angeles Rams, has died. He was 89.",
      "The Rams confirmed Robinson's death on Monday. He died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, of complications from pneumonia, USC said in a release.",
      "Robinson is high on the short list of football coaches who enjoyed significant success in both the college and pro ranks. He went 104-35-4 at USC and 75-68 with the Rams, winning postseason games and contending for championships regularly with both teams. Robinson was particularly successful in bowl games, going 8-1 in the postseason with USC and UNLV.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was one of the greatest college coaches ever, and his love for USC and his love for the game of football was second to none,\u201d said Ronnie Lott, an All-American safety under Robinson at USC. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that while playing for him, he gave us the ability to feel like we were larger than life. And his commitment to making sure that we had more than just football in our lives was so superior.\"",
      "Robinson was a member of the College Football Hall of Fame for his two successful tenures at USC. He also became the winningest coach in Rams history during his nine-year tenure with the NFL club. Sean McVay passed Robinson's career victories total only last month.",
      "Robinson coached at USC from 1976 to 1982 and again from 1993 to 1997. He never had a losing record at the school, and his Trojans won five conference titles and four Rose Bowls. Running backs Charles White (1979) and Marcus Allen (1981) won the Heisman Trophy while playing in Robinson's relentless rushing offenses.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was very demanding, but in a human way,\u201d said Paul McDonald, the quarterback of Robinson's superbly talented 1979 team at USC. \u201cHe had great interpersonal skills, and he knew how to connect with people. He made you want to play hard for him and to run through walls. You cared for him because he cared so much for you.\u201d",
      "Robinson moved to the Rams in 1983 and reached the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons, winning four playoff games and advancing to two NFC championship games.",
      "The Rams observed a moment of silence for Robinson at SoFi Stadium on Monday night before they faced the Miami Dolphins.",
      "Robinson spent six seasons coaching UNLV after his second USC tenure, also serving a stint as the Rebels' athletic director. He was most recently a senior consultant at LSU from 2019 to 2021 during the tenure of head coach Ed Orgeron.",
      "Robinson was born July 25, 1935, in Chicago, and he grew up in the Bay Area, attending prep school with close friend John Madden and graduating from high school in 1954. He played tight end on Oregon's 1958 Rose Bowl championship team before beginning his coaching career with the Ducks.",
      "Robinson became John McKay's offensive coordinator at USC in 1972, coaching the unbeaten 1972 consensus national championship team and the 1974 team that went 10-1-1. Robinson left the Trojans for one year to join Madden with the Oakland Raiders, but returned to USC in 1976 when McKay took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Robinson coached USC to seven outstanding seasons, winning the Pac-8 or Pac-10 titles and the Rose Bowl in three of his first four years in charge. His 1978 team was named national champions by the UPI coaches' poll, while Bear Bryant's Alabama won the AP title. He coached a long list of stars during his tenure, from White and Allen to Pro Football Hall of Famers Lott, Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Bruce Matthews.",
      "Robinson kept winning in 1983 when he moved to the Rams, who played their home games in Anaheim, California. With an offense led by Eric Dickerson, Robinson's teams racked up six playoff appearances and lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions in two conference title games.",
      "Robinson's second tenure at USC included a fourth Rose Bowl victory, but the school dismissed him following the 1997 season.",
      "Robinson then coached UNLV from 1999-2004, taking over a program that had lost 16 games in a row. He got the Rebels to only the third bowl appearance in school history in just his second season, but Robinson stepped away after the 2004 season with a 28-42 record at the school. One of his more notable victories was a 23-5 win at No. 14 Wisconsin in 2003.",
      "\u201cFootball lost a legend today,\u201d UNLV director of athletics Erick Harper said. \u201cCoach Robinson was revered by his players, peers, fans and co-workers. He led a wonderful life on and off the football field at so many places, including here at UNLV as both a coach and administrator. Our thoughts and prayers go out to John\u2019s family as we remember all that he did for the sport nationally and right here in Las Vegas.\u201d",
      "Robinson spent many years between his coaching jobs in broadcasting on television and radio. He returned to football five years ago at LSU as a consultant to Orgeron, the former USC coach.",
      "Robinson is survived by his wife, Beverly, his four children, two stepchildren and 10 grandchildren.",
      "A celebration of Robinson\u2019s life will be held following the college football season, in accordance with his wishes.",

    "story": [
      "A detailed assessment of the hurricane damage to Tropicana Field concludes that the home of the Tampa Bay Rays is structurally sound and can be repaired for about $55.7 million in time for the 2026 season",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A detailed assessment of the hurricane damage to Tropicana Field concludes that the home of the Tampa Bay Rays is structurally sound and can be repaired for about $55.7 million in time for the 2026 season.",
      "The 412-page report released Tuesday by the City of St. Petersburg, which owns the building, found that the basic structure of the domed stadium \u201cdoes not appear to have been adversely affected\u201d by Hurricane Milton's winds, which shredded most of its fabric roof.",
      "\u201cThe primary structure is serviceable and capable of supporting a replacement tension membrane fabric roof,\u201d said the report by Hennessy Construction Services.",
      "Eighteen of the ballpark's 24 fabric panels failed when Milton roared ashore Oct. 9, the report found. There was also damage to interior parts of the Trop, as it's known for short, from rainwater and other storm-related causes. The ballpark opened in 1990 and has been the Rays' home since their inception in 1998.",
      "Tropicana Field is already scheduled to be demolished when a new, $1.3 billion ballpark is finished in time for the 2028 season. With unforeseen costs to the city and Pinellas County from two hurricanes \u2014 vast amounts of debris removal, damage to parks and infrastructure \u2014 two of the main financial sources for the new ballpark could reconsider those plans or decide not to repair the Trop at all.",
      "The St. Petersburg City Council will discuss the report at its Nov. 21 meeting.",
      "\u201cWe have so much need across the city,\u201d said council member Brandi Gabbard at a meeting last week. \u201cI love the Rays. I love Tropicana Field. It\u2019s not about not wanting to do this. It\u2019s about a balance of priorities.\u201d",
      "The council recently approved $6.5 million to clean up the ballpark and protect it from any further damage, including waterproofing areas such as the press box, seating sections and scoreboard.",
      "The city does have an insurance claim for the damage and repairs, but it includes a $22 million deductible and probably would only cover part of the overall costs. That means taxpayer dollars could have to be used.",
      "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch said the city anticipates that insurance and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds will cover the bulk of repair expenses.",
      "\"We believe having our hometown team play in St. Petersburg as soon as possible is important for our community,\u201d Welch said in a statement.",
      "Matt Silverman, co-president of the Rays, said in a statement that the team \u201cwill continue to have discussions with the city about how to move forward.\u201d",
      "Since the ballpark under this damage and repair assessment would not be ready until the 2026 season, the Rays must find another place to play next year.",
      "Major League Baseball wants the Rays to remain in the area near their fanbase if at all possible, with several Tampa Bay-area spring training sites suggested. These include ballparks in Clearwater (Phillies), Tampa (Yankees), Dunedin (Blue Jays), Sarasota (Orioles), Lakeland (Tigers) and the Rays' own spring training home in Port Charlotte. Most of these locations host minor league teams during summer.",
      "The planned new Rays ballpark is part of a $6.5 billion project that will include affordable housing, a Black history museum, retail and office space, restaurants and bars. The project is known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which was once a thriving Black community displaced by construction of the ballpark and an interstate highway.",
      "One option would be to delay the project by a year to accommodate the Tropicana Field repairs.",
      "\u201cThe City plans to meet its obligations to ensure that the Rays can play in St. Pete, and the redevelopment of the Historic Gas Plant District and the construction of a new stadium move forward,\u201d Welch said.",

      "Linebacker Leo Chenal, who led a wave of Kansas City defenders who burst through the left side of Denver's field goal protection unit, blocked Wil Lutz's 35-yard attempt, preserving K.C.'s stunning 16-14 win.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complete shock,\" Chenal said after serving as the hero in the latest of so many great escapes by the Chiefs, who have won their nine games by an average of just 6.4 points. \"Not much I can say about it. Glory to Jesus Christ and everything because I was really praying for something to happen.",
      "\"That moment is so heavy, there\u2019s a second on the clock and they\u2019re going to kick the field goal. You feel the weight of the moment.\u201d",
      "And Alex Forsyth felt the weight of Chenal and several teammates as he tumbled over backward on the play. The Chiefs said they had noticed earlier in the game a weak link in Denver's protection as they nearly blocked an extra point and a 60-yard field goal attempt in the first half.",
      "\u201cThe guy who I was rushing, he was kind of light on his toes a little bit,\u201d Chenal told Pro Football Talk.",
      "Payton said Monday he didn't want Forsyth catching flack for failure.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t on the player,\u201d Payton insisted. \u201cThis is on all of us. This is on us as coaches. We\u2019ve got to continue to look at, \u2018Hey, are we big enough stature-wise there for that?\u2019 And understanding how the rush was coming. It\u2019s disappointing, and yet it\u2019s not something that\u2019s new when a big play is made at the end of the game.\u201d",
      "Payton added, \"Credit them for that. They exploited an area that we obviously felt was fixed and stronger, but not fixed enough.\u201d",
      "The Broncos blew a big chance to gain a foothold in the AFC playoff race, but they are still in the seventh and final spot trying to fend off the Cincinnati Bengals and Indianapolis Colts, who are both 4-6 and both of whom have games down the stretch against Denver.",
      "\u201cThe sky is not falling,\u201d Payton said.",
      "Nor are heads rolling. Just a crestfallen team trying to make corrections and move on so that the gutwrenching setback doesn't end up defining their season.",

      "FRISCO, Texas -- FRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Dak Prescott has decided on surgery for his torn hamstring, ending the season for the franchise quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys when their playoff hopes were already fading fast.",
      "Owner Jerry Jones said Prescott will have the surgery Wednesday in New York. Jones was speaking on his radio show Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHis prognosis is wonderful,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt just means we're not going to have him for the rest of the year.\u201d",
      "The decision comes a little more than a week after Prescott injured the hamstring in a 27-21 loss at Atlanta. He was on the sideline for Dallas\u2019 fourth consecutive loss, 34-6 at home to Philadelphia on Sunday.",
      "The Cowboys (3-6) already knew they would be without last season\u2019s runner-up in NFL MVP voting for at least a month, and were resigned to the outcome that was finalized after Prescott visited one more specialist.",
      "The recovery time is at least three months, about the amount of time former Cowboys left tackle Tyron Smith was sidelined after sustaining a similar injury in training camp two years ago.",
      "Prescott\u2019s hamstring was partially torn off the bone, a condition known as a partial avulsion. Surgery isn\u2019t always required in such instances, as opposed to the full tear off the bone that Smith sustained.",
      "It\u2019s the second time in five years that the 31-year-old Prescott will miss more than half the season because of an injury. He broke an ankle in Week 5 in 2020, when Dallas finished 6-10.",
      "The Cowboys, who play Houston (6-4) at home Monday night, are in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2020. The defending NFC East champions finished 12-5 in each of three consecutive playoff seasons.",
      "Prescott wasn\u2019t having a great year when he got hurt. He had 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions for an offense that was in the middle of the pack in the NFL after being among the league\u2019s best in the playoff years.",
      "Cooper Rush started in Prescott\u2019s place against the Eagles but had just 45 yards passing, the fewest for a Dallas starter in a game since Matt Cassel had 37 in another lost season for the Cowboys in 2015.",
      "Rush and Trey Lance, who briefly replaced Rush in the third quarter and came on for good later, combined for 66 passing yards. It\u2019s the fewest for Dallas since having 34 in a 10-6 loss to Tampa Bay in 2001.",
      "Rush will start again Monday night against the Texans. The Cowboys signed Will Grier to their practice squad Tuesday. Grier was with the Cowboys from 2021-22.",

      "On more than one occasion, the paper said, Golden allegedly took photos of women walking or driving and sent those pictures to the subjects involved. Alleged stalking incidents also included Golden, a married father of two young boys, showing up to locations where he knew the women would be.",
      "\u201cAgain, I know what\u2019s going on. I know the situation,\" Golden said. \"Our staff\u2019s done a great job. Our guys have done a good job. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time together over the last couple days and continue to prepare for what we have in front of us, which was this game tonight and what will be Florida State on Friday.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think they know who I am and, again, they\u2019re mature,\" Golden said. \u201cThey\u2019re all really good guys and all super focused. We had really good practices. We had a great shoot-around and I thought they were all really locked in. I felt like we were going to play really well.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 13:54:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Even with National signing day for college's small sports taking place this week, there remains uncertainty about how many athletes will make teams at many of the country's schools",
    "story": [
      "Even with National signing day for college's small sports taking place this week, there remains uncertainty about how many athletes will make teams at many of the country's schools",
      "Helping athletes find college scholarships has never been easy, but in some ways at least it was predictable. There have always been players vying for a reasonably well-defined number of roster spots, some that include scholarships, others that don't.",
      "This year, all that math has been thrown away, part of the fallout from the pending $2.8 billion NCAA antitrust settlement.",
      "Liam Barrett, the managing director of the U.S. Sports Scholarships recruiting service, said it was no surprise when a soccer player called last week to say his spot on the roster at an Atlantic 10 Conference school was gone.",
      "That player will enter a transfer portal that is likely to double in size to as many as 1,600 soccer players, many like him who are being cut from teams by coaches dealing with shrinking roster sizes and uncertainty about the future.",
      "\u201cIt's just going to make it so much more difficult for someone who's not even in the college system yet to break through,\u201d Barrett said in explaining the cascading impact new college roster limits are having on high school prospects.",
      "Many schools were busy right up to Wednesday's deadline for the revamped National Signing Day for \u201cnon-revenue\u201d sports \u2014 everything outside of football and basketball \u2014 trying to determine how many roster spots they will have to offer for the 2025-26 school year.",
      "This is happening because the settlement that clears the way for schools to pay their players also dictates new roster limits, forcing athletic departments to reimagine the way teams \u2014 from the biggest (football) to the smallest (golf) \u2014 are built.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hearing about walk-ons and future recruits ... who haven\u2019t signed yet getting that hard phone call,\u201d said Minnesota women's volleyball coach Keegan Cook. \u201cThat\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s really hard, because now a roster spot is really a limited commodity, for lack of a better word, where it didn\u2019t used to be.\u201d",
      "At first glance, the terms of the House settlement \u2014 the agreement between plaintiffs, the NCAA and college's biggest conferences that is reshaping college sports \u2014look like a bonanza for college athletes.",
      "Scholarship limits (for instance, 85 for football and exactly 9.9 for men's wrestling) have been eliminated and replaced by roster limits (105 for football and 30 for wrestling). If a school wants to, it can offer scholarships to every player on a team.",
      "Doing so, however, will cost an exorbitant amount. Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel suggested if his athletic department decided to fund scholarships for every available spot, educational costs under the new rules would add $29 million to annual expenses that are already slated to grow by around $21 million to pay for the new athlete revenue-sharing provisions in the settlement.",
      "So, choices will have to be made. Will schools give scholarships to all 105 players on their football team? If so, will they make cuts elsewhere? Or will they continue to ask boosters and fans for more money to backfill the growing costs?",
      "Most of the smaller, so-called Olympic sports have long operated in a different world. For instance, some divide their 9.9 scholarships and distribute partial aid to, say, 20 players. They then add depth with walk-on athletes, some hoping to land scholarship help in the future.",
      "Under the new system, some schools might choose to eliminate a sport or two altogether. Others will pare roster sizes, whether by choice or because the new roster limits actually make them get smaller.",
      "In wrestling, for instance, the settlement calls for a limit of 30 athletes. Some of the nation's top programs have up to 35 wrestlers on their team, many of whom pay their own way.",
      "\u201cWrestling can provide access to college for so many young men and women who otherwise wouldn't have that opportunity,\u201d said Mike Moyer, the executive director of the National Wrestling Coaches Association. \u201cWhenever you start limiting opportunities, it's always unfortunate.\"",
      "Wisconsin athletic director Chris McIntosh estimated sports across his campus will lose between 80 and 100 athletes by the time changes come into play for the 2025-26 school year.",
      "Nebraska's AD, Troy Dannen, told Huskeronline he's determined not to cut scholarships or sports, which is a $200 million operation at Nebraska. He is asking coaches and other administrators to start thinking outside the box.",
      "\u201cIs there a better way to allocate?\u201d he said.",
      "Minnesota eliminated three men's sports \u2014 indoor track, tennis and gymnastics \u2014 during the pandemic, easing the pain now.",
      "\u201cThat decision, in hindsight, looks really strategic right now,\" Gophers AD Mark Coyle said.",
      "Underlying the entire college sports model is the reality that football, with help from men's basketball, produces the millions in revenue that fund every other sport on a typical campus.",
      "The SEC helped its 16 schools answer some questions this fall by announcing it would keep the 85-scholarship limit intact for 2025, while allowing teams to fill the other 20 spots with walk-ons. The 105 roster spots would actually be a net loss, since the average roster size of big-school football teams tops 120.",
      "Last spring, there were reports that the SEC would cap swimming rosters at 22, which is eight fewer than the new limit. Because women\u2019s swimming teams are currently limited to 14 scholarships and men\u2019s to 9.9, the new cap, if true, could dramatically increase the number of scholarships for those teams but also slash roster sizes that topped 40 swimmers in some cases.",
      "All these choices bring about the possibility that the age of the walk-on athlete \u2014 the scrappy grinders who do it for the love of the game, school or both \u2014 could be nearing an end. Chances to develop diamond-in-the-rough athletes could be lost, as well.",
      "\u201cIt's like, we don't care if you're a walk-on, there isn't a spot for you on the roster,\u201d said Steve Roush, executive director of the Southern California's grassroots local swimming committee. \u201cThat could have some devastating effects for our numbers at the collegiate level.\u201d",
      "One of the least-understood dynamics in American sports is the outsized impact college athletics have on the number of medals the U.S. wins every four years at the Summer Olympics.",
      "The world's most dominant Olympic team (the U.S. led the medals in Paris with 126) got 67% of its athletes from the NCAA pipeline.",
      "Shrinking the number of players in collegiate Olympic sports programs could eventually harm U.S. prospects, along with the overall quality of the Olympic movement itself (about 8.5% of athletes not representing the U.S. also competed in NCAA sports).",
      "\u201cThere's a lot of anxiety around what impact this is going to have on Olympic sports,\u201d said Rich Bender, the executive director of USA Wrestling, who is also on the board of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. \u201cYou don't have to have too big an imagination to think that if the pool of resources is being drastically reduced, the athletic department is probably not thinking of cutting expenses around football and basketball. So where do you go?\"",
      "Even with some of the grim predictions, it's not all doom and gloom among the experts. Some see lost opportunities for fringe athletes at bigger schools as a chance for them to catch on at smaller programs and actually get some playing time.",
      "Others believe colleges feel the deep connection to Olympic sports.",
      "\u201cThe good news is, there\u2019s been a lot of awareness around, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s not cool to cut programs,'\" Bender said.",
      "Most see more stability coming in 2026 or 2027, after the House settlement is finalized and schools, conferences and the NCAA have locked in on the numbers.",
      "For the upcoming school year, though, uncertainty reigns. As Dannen, the Nebraska athletic director, put it: \u201cThere are 100 questions I don\u2019t have the answers for.\"",

      "Canada women's soccer coach Bev Priestman has been fired after an independent review of a drone surveillance scandal at the Paris Olympics",
      "Canada women's coach Bev Priestman, suspended following a drone surveillance scandal at the Paris Olympics, was fired Tuesday following an independent review.",
      "Assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi were also fired as Canada Soccer released findings of the investigation.",
      "New Zealand complained about a drone flying over practices before the start of the Olympic tournament, prompting FIFA to fine Canada Soccer $228,000 and strip six standings points from the team. Priestman, Mander and Lombardi were all suspended by soccer\u2019s international governing body for a year.",
      "Despite the penalty, Canada advanced to the group stage and lost to Germany on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals.",
      "The investigation by attorney Sonia Regenbogen of the firm Mathews, Dinsdale & Clark found no evidence that Canadian players had viewed the drone footage. But it found that assistant coaches and other support staff \u201cdid not feel they could challenge the authority of the head coach.\u201d",
      "Priestman, who could not immediately be reached for comment, led Canada to the gold medal at the Tokyo Games. The review found that no drones were used in Japan, but that two national team coaches engaged in improper surveillance \u201cpredating the 2024 Paris Olympics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe findings of the independent investigator reveal that the drone incident in Paris was a symptom of a past pattern of an unacceptable culture and insufficient oversight within the national teams,\u201d Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue said in a statement. \u201cThis is no longer part of our operations. In fact, the investigation findings strengthen our resolve to continue implementing changes that are needed to improve Canada Soccer, in all respects, and to do so with urgency. Even though the independent investigation has been concluded, there is more to be done to set things on a new course.\u201d",
      "The review additionally found that allegations suggesting the men's team used drones to spy on an opponent at the Copa America were unfounded. However, it found \u201cpotential violations\u201d by former Canada men's coach John Herdman, who was not interviewed because of scheduling issues.",
      "\u201cPotential violations of the Canada Soccer Code of Conduct and Ethics by the former head coach of the Men\u2019s National Team were identified,\u201d Canada Soccer said in a summary of the investigation. \u201cPursuant to the Canada Soccer Disciplinary Code, a disciplinary process is being initiated to adjudicate these potential violations.\u201d",

      "Qatar has been praised at the United Nations\u2019 top human rights body for improving labor laws before the 2022 World Cup",
      "GENEVA -- Qatar was praised at the United Nations\u2019 top human rights body on Tuesday for improving labor laws before the 2022 World Cup, though it was urged to fully abolish its employment system for migrant workers.",
      "Qatar returned to the Human Rights Council in Geneva for its five-yearly review for the first time since the soccer tournament that needed hundreds of thousands of foreign workers to build stadiums and other essential projects.",
      "Soccer governing body FIFA is set to confirm Saudi Arabia in December as host of the 2034 World Cup \u2014 setting up another decade of scrutiny on how human rights are respected while preparing for more teams playing more games in more stadiums.",
      "In Qatar, better labor law protections have been passed in recent years relating to a minimum wage, freedom to change employers and combating forced labor and trafficking, according to the emirate\u2019s senior diplomat in Geneva.",
      "Qatar \u201chighly appreciated\u201d the contribution of migrant workers who are \u201ctrue partners,\u201d said Hend Abdulrahman Al Muftah, its permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, in translated comments.",
      "Qatar was urged \u2014 or \u201crecommended,\u201d in the formal diplomatic language of the UN rights body \u2014 by French delegate Claire Thuaudet to \u201cpursue the implementation of the labor laws\u201d linked to the 2022 World Cup.",
      "Sierra Leone said Qatar should \u201cconsider abolishing all vestiges\u201d of the labor law system known as kafala.",
      "\u201cWe commend Qatar for its notable reforms in labor migrant legislation,\u201d the Netherlands delegation said. \u201cThese are significant but more effective enforcement and implementations are needed.\u201d",
      "Qatar also was asked to abolish the death penalty by states including Brazil, Ireland, Italy and New Zealand, and decriminalize consenting same-sex relations by Brazil, Mexico and Spain.",
      "Anticipating criticism of Qatar\u2019s record on women\u2019s rights, Al Muftah said Qatar now had 120 women in diplomatic roles after the number was just three several years ago.",
      "Sweden later recommended Qatar review its laws relating to women\u2019s rights in divorce, custody of children and inheritance while Iceland called for abolition of the male guardianship system. Iceland also urged decriminalizing abortion and ensure access to reproductive health services without needing the permission of a male guardian or showing a marriage certificate.",
      "Qatar\u2019s delegation pointed to the country rising from outside the top 100 to now rank No. 84 in the global index of press freedom. Top-ranked Norway said Qatar should ensure \u201ccivil society, human rights defenders and journalists can operate freely without fear of reprisals.\u201d",
      "Qatar is widely expected to be a strong contender in bidding to host the 2036 Olympics, and concluded its presentation Tuesday with sports ministry official Nasser Ali Al-Khater hailing sports as \u201can important platform to enhance cooperation between peoples.",
      "\u201cThis is what we achieved during the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cQatar shall continue its efforts in the field of sport and empowerment.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 13:38:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago",

      "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago",
      "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago.",
      "The expansion comes eight months after Waymo began offering rides in Los Angeles to a limited group of passengers chosen from a waiting list that had ballooned to more than 300,000 people. Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",
      "After Waymo received approval from California regulators to charge for rides 15 months ago, the company initially chose to launch its operations in San Francisco before offering a limited service in Los Angeles.",
      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",
      "Electric auto pioneer Tesla is aiming to launch a rival \u201cCybercab\u201d service by 2026, although its CEO Elon Musk said he hopes the company can get the required regulatory clearances to operate in Texas and California by next year.",
      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

      "Details about a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month",
      "LONDON -- Details of a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month.",
      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

    "story": [
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists can't know precisely when a volcano is about to erupt, but they can sometimes pick up telltale signs.",
      "That happened two years ago with the world's largest active volcano. About two months before Mauna Loa spewed rivers of glowing orange molten lava, geologists detected small earthquakes nearby and other signs, and they warned residents on Hawaii's Big Island.",
      "Now a study of the volcano's lava confirms their timeline for when the molten rock below was on the move.",
      "\u201cVolcanoes are tricky because we don\u2019t get to watch directly what\u2019s happening inside \u2013 we have to look for other signs,\" said Erik Klemetti Gonzalez, a volcano expert at Denison University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Upswelling ground and increased earthquake activity near the volcano resulted from magma rising from lower levels of Earth\u2019s crust to fill chambers beneath the volcano, said Kendra Lynn, a research geologist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and co-author of a new study in Nature Communications.",
      "When pressure was high enough, the magma broke through brittle surface rock and became lava \u2013 and the eruption began in late November 2022. Later, researchers collected samples of volcanic rock for analysis.",
      "The chemical makeup of certain crystals within the lava indicated that around 70 days before the eruption, large quantities of molten rock had moved from around 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to 3 miles (5 kilometers) under the summit to a mile (2 kilometers) or less beneath, the study found. This matched the timeline the geologists had observed with other signs.",
      "The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. Most of the U.S. volcanoes that scientists consider to be active are found in Hawaii, Alaska and the West Coast.",
      "Worldwide, around 585 volcanoes are considered active.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump begins filling key posts in his second administration, social media users are pushing false claims that the 2024 election was rigged in his favor.",
      "One such narrative claims that billionaire Elon Musk facilitated the alleged fraud with his internet service provider Starlink, manipulating the vote count through election equipment such as ballot tabulators. Starlink, a subsidiary of Musk's SpaceX company, uses satellites to offer high-speed internet, even in remote areas.",
      "Some rural counties used the technology during the 2024 race to access their electronic poll books.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk used his internet provider Starlink to steal the 2024 election for President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "THE FACTS: These claims are unfounded. Election officials, including from multiple swing states, told The Associated Press that their voting equipment doesn\u2019t use Starlink and is not even connected to the internet. States have additional security measures to ensure that the count is accurate, according to experts. Election officials and security agencies have reported no significant issues with the 2024 race.",
      "\u201cIt is not possible that Starlink was used to hack or change the outcome of the US presidential election,\u201d David Becker, founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, wrote in an email. \u201cThis, quite simply, did not happen, and could not happen, thanks to the security measures we have in place, and these conspiracy theories echo other disinformation we\u2019ve heard over the past several years.\u201d",
      "Becker further explained that the country's nearly 10,000 election jurisdictions use a wide range of voting machines that are not connected to the internet while voting occurs and that nearly all votes are recorded on paper ballots, which are audited by hand to confirm the results of electronic tabulators.",
      "\u201cIf anyone tried to interfere with the machines to rig the election, it would be discovered through multiple means, including reconciling the registered voters who cast ballots with the number of votes, as well as the audits,\u201d he added.",
      "Certain jurisdictions in a few states allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.",
      "Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed. Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.",
      "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a statement on Nov. 6 that CISA has \u201cno evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Despite a lack of evidence, many on social media suggested that Starlink could indeed have been used to steal the election.",
      "\u201cIf Trump & Elon's \u2018little secret\u2019 was to use Starlink in swing states to tally the votes & rig the election \u2014 an investigation & hand recount is crucial. Now,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 41,700 times as of Tuesday.",
      "Another widely shared X post states: \u201cElon Musk used Starlink to hack our elections so he can have nice things while inflicting pain on Americans. Are we really going to turn a blind eye to what happened and let the worst people among us run the country.\u201d",
      "Election officials in North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2014 three of the seven swing states Trump won \u2014 told the AP that their voting equipment is never connected to the internet. In some cases, this is mandated by state law.",
      "\u201cSatellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,\u201d said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. \u201cIn addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. And no, tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet in North Carolina.\"",
      "The Tar Heel State prohibits its voting systems from being \u201cconnected to a network\u201d and requires any feature that allows such a connection to be disabled. This includes the internet, as well as any other wired or wireless connections.",
      "Gannon added that North Carolina has \u201cno evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone\u201d and requested that people stop spreading misinformation about elections.",
      "Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for the Georgia secretary of state's office, called the claims spreading online \u201cabsolutely conspiratorial nonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don't use Starlink equipment for any part of our elections, and never have,\u201d he said. \u201cOur election equipment is 100% air-gapped and never connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cair-gapped\u201d refers to a security measure that isolates a secured computer network from those that are unsecured. This means it is impossible to use the internet to manipulate the software that tallies Georgia's votes or the memory cards on which they're recorded, according to Hassinger. He explained that memory cards are transported by hand in secure bags with tamper-evident ties to a central elections office where votes are tabulated. There is also a chain of custody protocol in place so that their movement is well documented.",
      "Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, wrote in an email: \u201cCounties do not use Starlink to transmit unofficial or official election results. No voting system in Pennsylvania is ever connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "A pilot program in Arizona's Coconino, Apache and Navajo counties intended to \u201cenhance connectivity in underserved areas\" uses Starlink systems for electronic poll book synchronization, according to JP Martin, a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state's office. The state's election equipment is air-gapped, one of many security measures.",
      "Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin also employ stringent precautions to protect the integrity of their voting equipment.",
      "Some posts spreading online pointed to a local news segment in which the registrar of voters in Tulare County, California, noted that internet connectivity at the county's poll sites was improved this year thanks to Starlink. Stephanie Hill, a systems and procedures analyst for the agency, wrote in an email that \u201cthis connection is strictly for voter check-in purposes only and in no way a part of our voting system.\u201d California is among the states that prohibit their voting equipment from being connected to the internet.",
      "Trump is currently beating Vice President Kamala Harris in Tulare County with 60% of the vote.",
      "Pamela Smith, president and CEO of Verified Voting, agreed that the idea that Starlink was used to rig the election is absurd.",
      "\u201cWhile Starlink provided connectivity in a number of jurisdictions for electronic poll books (EPBs) in this election, neither Starlink nor other types of communication networks play any role in counting votes,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOur elections produce huge quantities of physical evidence. A satellite system like Starlink cannot steal that.\u201d",

      "Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy and markets",
      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy.",
      "Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they\u2019ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs.",
      "Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else.",
      "\u2014 Stan Choe",
      "Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment:",
      "Technology stocks soared in Trump\u2019s first term, helped by the administration\u2019s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump\u2019s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry\u2019s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains.",
      "This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What\u2019s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology \u2014 an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China.",
      "Trump\u2019s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern.",
      "Still, in a sign of tech\u2019s more conciliatory attitude, Trump\u2019s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry\u2019s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "\u2014 Michael Liedtke",
      "Trump\u2019s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry.",
      "Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said.",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He\u2019s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices.",
      "As opposed to Trump\u2019s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said.",
      "Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.",
      "The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump\u2019s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men\u2019s jeans would cost $90 to $96.",
      "\u2014 Anne D'Innocenzio",
      "Trump has said he wants to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it\u2019s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged.",
      "Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry.",
      "But remember Trump\u2019s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall.",
      "Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government\u2019s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted.",
      "A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies.",
      "The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.",
      "Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar.",
      "In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops.",
      "\u2014 Tom Murphy",
      "The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs.",
      "Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines.",
      "Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group.",
      "Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern.",
      "Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM\u2019s North American production comes from Mexico, while it\u2019s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford.",
      "Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can\u2019t afford the current average price of over $47,000.",
      "Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs.",
      "\u2014 Tom Krisher",
      "Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a \u201cnew era\u201d of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back.",
      "Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones.",
      "\u2014 Paul Harloff",
      "Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus.",
      "Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete.",
      "But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies.",
      "Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has surged above $86,000. Shares of crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 60% since the election.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",

      "Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year.",
      "This year the world is on track to put 41.2 billion tons (37.4 billion metric tons) of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It\u2019s a 0.8% increase from 2023, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track emissions. Several United Nations reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to possibly limit warming to an internationally agreed-upon threshold.",
      "This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan.",
      "If the world continues burning fossil fuels at today's level, it has six years before passing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris, said study co-author Stephen Sitch. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit), according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cWe clearly are not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said study co-author Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. \"We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests.''",
      "Scientists used reported emissions from rich countries and oil industry data, O\u2019Sullivan said. The 2024 figure includes projections for the last couple months or so. The Global Carbon Project team released figures for the four biggest carbon emitters \u2014 China, the United States, India and Europe. It also produced more detailed and final figures for about 200 countries for 2023.",
      "The continued rise in carbon emissions is mostly from the developing world and China. Many analysts had been hoping that China \u2014 by far the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions \u2014 would have peaked its carbon dioxide emissions by now. Instead China's emissions rose 0.2% from 2023, with coal pollution up 0.3%, Global Carbon Project calculated. But it could drop to zero in the next two months and is \u201cbasically flat,\u201d O'Sullivan said.",
      "That's nothing close to the increase in India, which at 8% of the globe's carbon pollution is third-largest carbon emitter. India's carbon pollution jumped 4.6% in 2024, the scientists said.",
      "Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the U.S. mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. The U.S. was responsible for 13% of the globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Historically, it's responsible for 21% of the world's emissions since 1950, a figure that matters since the gas persists in the atmosphere for centuries.",
      "Twenty-two nations have shown steady decreases in emissions, O'Sullivan said, singling out the United States as one of those. The biggest emission drops from 2014 to 2023 were in the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.",
      "Europe, which accounts for 7% of the world's carbon pollution, saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year \u2014 driven by a big cut in coal emissions.",
      "Global carbon emissions are well more than double what they were 50 years ago and 50% than they were in 1999. Emissions have gone up about 6% in the past decade.",
      "\u201cThis is a needed reminder of the urgency with which we need to address the cause of the climate crisis,\" said PowerShift Africa founder Mohamed Adow, who wasn't part of the study. \u201cThe problem is the fossil fuel industry is kicking and screaming for us to slow down and to keep them in business for longer. That\u2019s why they poured money into Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.\u201d",
      "Carbon dioxide from humanity's burning of coal, oil and natural gas amounts to 2.6 million pounds (nearly 1.2 million kilograms) of the heat-trapping gas every second.",
      "Total carbon emissions \u2014 which include fossil fuel pollution and land use changes such as deforestation \u2014 are basically flat because land emissions are declining, the scientists said. That\u2019s an important and encouraging milestone amid bad news, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann",

      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump\u2019s reelection, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high",
      "NEW YORK -- As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump's reelection last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency topped $89,000 for the first time, briefly peaking at $89,995 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin's price oscillated throughout the day, but is still up more than 27% over the last week \u2014 standing at about $88,288 as of 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That's part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of last week's election.",
      "Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year's presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "\u201cCrypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,\u201d Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being \u201ccrypto-friendly\" and a potential shift in regulatory backing.",
      "But even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\u201d Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. When that reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. And, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term.",
      "Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value \u2014 which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.",
      "At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cInvestors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen these wild swings in the past.\u201d",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has \u201cgrown very rapidly over the last several years,\" adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

    "summary": "Australia&rsquo;s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
    "story": [
      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

    "story": [
      "Teixeira faced a maximum of 200 months -- more than 16 years -- in prison.",
      "Jack Teixeira, the former Massachusetts Air National Guardsman who prosecutors said \"perpetrated one of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history,\" was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "The prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised release.",
      "Judge Indira Talwani issued the sentence on Tuesday in Boston federal court.",
      "Teixeira pleaded guilty in March to six counts of willfully retaining and transmitting national defense information.",
      "Joshua S. Levy, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, whose office prosecuted the case, said the \"significant sentence sends a powerful message to every individual who holds a top-secret clearance.\"",
      "\"I expect that starting tomorrow, Jack Teixeira's name will be mentioned when people are trained about the gravity of a top-secret clearance and the consequences if you leak information,\" Levy said at a press briefing following the sentencing.",
      "Levy said Teixeira \"abused his position of trust\" and put himself above his country when he exploited his top-secret clearance and \"made the deliberate choice\" for over a year to access hundreds of classified documents and share them on Discord.",
      "\"Today, Mr. Teixeira has paid a very heavy price for the laws he broke and for the incredible damage that he caused,\" Levy said, noting that it could take several years to know the full extent of the damage.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement that the sentence is a \"stark warning to all those entrusted with protecting national defense information: betray that trust, and you will be held accountable.\"",
      "Prosecutors had asked the judge to impose the maximum prison sentence of 200 months -- more than 16 years -- in prison.",
      "\"The harm the defendant caused to the national security from his disclosures of national defense information is extraordinary,\" prosecutors said in a memorandum filed ahead of the sentencing hearing. \"By posting intelligence products on the social media platform Discord to feed his own ego and impress his anonymous friends, Teixeira caused exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States. The scope of his betrayal is breathtaking.\"",
      "The defense sought the minimum sentence, citing Teixeira's autism and ADHD. They also argued he did not intend to harm the country, only to educate his online friends about world events.",
      "\"Jack is still essentially a child -- at the very least, a 'youthful offender' -- who has his whole life in front of him,\" defense attorneys Michael Bachrach and Brandan Kelley stated in a memorandum presented to the judge ahead of sentencing. \"At 22 years old, a sentence of 132 months' imprisonment would provide more than enough time for him to grow and mature; informed by his behavior as well as from his punishment.\"",
      "\"With the support of his family and mental health treatment providers, Jack should have little trouble living a productive life inside prison and upon his eventual release,\" the memorandum continued.",
      "Teixeira is also currently negotiating a disposition to his parallel, but related, military prosecution, the memo said.",
      "According to the signed plea agreement filed with the court, Teixeira agreed to plead guilty to all six counts charging him with willful retention and transmission of national defense information. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to charge him with additional counts under the Espionage Act.",
      "Teixeira \"accessed and printed hundreds of classified documents\" and posted images of them on Discord prior to his arrest in April 2023, a prosecutor said during the plea hearing.",
      "As part of his plea agreement, Teixeira must sit for a debrief with the Defense Department and the Justice Department and give back any sensitive materials that might remain in his possession.",
      "Federal prosecutors have made clear Teixeira had no business peering at classified information because his low-level job did not require it.",
      "\"The defendant\u2019s job was to troubleshoot computer workstations,\" Assistant United States Attorney Jason Casey said during a March hearing.",
      "Still, Casey said, Teixeira accessed \"hundreds\" of classified documents inside the secure facility where he worked and \"purposefully removed classified documents and information despite admonishments from his superiors to stop.\"",
      "Teixeira has admitted in court to knowing the documents were marked classified.",
      "Without mentioning specifics, federal prosecutors said Teixeira exposed information about the compromise by a foreign adversary of certain accounts belonging to a U.S. company and information about equipment the U.S. was sending to Ukraine, how it would be transferred and how it would be used upon receipt. Prosecutors said he also posted material about troop movements in Ukraine, a plot by a foreign adversary to attack U.S. forces abroad, and Western deliveries of supplies to the Ukrainian battlefield.",
      "Teixeira enlisted in the Air National Guard in 2019, according to his service record, and had top secret security clearance beginning in 2021, according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The Justice Department said he began posting classified documents online in January 2022.",
      "Teixeira will also face a military court-martial on charges alleging he violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice, according to the U.S. Air Force.",
      "The U.S. military reserves the right to separately prosecute a service member who has already been convicted in a federal court.",

      "Bannon had told donors to the We Build the Wall campaign that their money would 100% go toward building a wall along the U.S. southern border, while prosecutors say some of the $15 million in donations was secretly funneled to himself and the campaign's president, Brian Kolfage.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's expected choice of Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mike Waltz as his secretary of state and national security adviser, respectively, indicates China is going to be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, deepening U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Rubio and Waltz are both staunch China hawks. In fact, Rubio was sanctioned twice by Beijing in 2020 and may still be banned from entering China.",
      "Naming Rubio and Waltz is a \"strong sign that Trump's foreign policy priority will focus on China above all else,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. Though there will be a near-term focus on finding a resolution to the wars overseas, \"over the next four years, China -- by far and away -- will be the major focus,\" he said.",
      "That tracks with what Waltz has said himself. Earlier this month, he co-wrote in The Economist that the U.S. should \"urgently\" bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to an end so the U.S. can \"finally focus strategy attention where it should be: countering the greater the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.\"",
      "Rubio has called China the \"threat that will define this century\" and backed a bill to prevent the import of goods made by China's Uyghur minority. Waltz, who has said the U.S. is in a \"cold war\" with China, called for the U.S. to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.",
      "Trump has vowed to slap 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. He'll likely act on tariffs early in his administration, experts say, as an easy win that he can act on unilaterally to show he's delivering a key campaign promise. It will be highly disruptive to U.S.-China relations and U.S. businesses, so experts say there will likely be a lot of lobbying from Trump's allies in the business world to narrow the tariffs to a few key sectors.",
      "In addition to tariffs, the U.S. has a \"huge toolkit for economic warfare\" that the Trump administration could use, according to Thomas, including more sanctions on Chinese companies and expanding export controls to more industries.",
      "But billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk could be a moderating voice for a softer approach to China amid all of this. Musk has deep business interests in China and could become a key middleman for dialogue between Trump and China's Xi Jinping.",
      "Telsa depends on China for production and as a key consumer market. Musk is a household name in China and gets the red-carpet treatment from Chinese officials when he visits.",
      "Musk could become the \"principal, go-between interlocutor\" between Xi and Trump, according to Ian Bremmer, the founder of Eurasia Group. \"I think Elon would certainly be interested in it.\"",
      "The Chinese government \"certainly will\" reach out to Musk to see how they can use him to influence Trump, Bremmer added.",
      "About half of all Tesla EVs are made in China, and Musk has received perks from the Chinese government that are rarely given to foreign players. Musk has even parroted Beijing's views on geopolitical issues, saying Taiwan is an \"integral part of China.\"",
      "Regardless, Beijing is gearing up for a volatile four years under Trump. Beijing is trying to revive a struggling economy, and the uncertainty of a Trump presidency is \"deeply worrying,\" according to Bremmer. \"They will want the relationship to be more constructive in this environment because this is a bad time for them to have a crisis.\""

      "Republican senators meet behind closed doors on Wednesday morning to cast their votes to choose McConnell's successor in a three-person race that pits two senators -- John Thune and John Cornyn -- who are seen as McConnell proteges and the third -- Rick Scott -- who has pledged his loyalty to Trump.",
      "Many of Trump's most high-profile supporters -- including Elon Musk, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson -- are loudly campaigning against Thune and Cornyn, saying the race will determine whether the Republican-controlled Senate will be sufficiently loyal to the Trump agenda.",
      "As Carlson put it, \"Rick Scott of Florida is the only candidate who agrees with Donald Trump. Call your senator and demand a public endorsement of Rick Scott.\"",
      "Those campaigning against Thune and Cornyn portray the race as more than a leadership battle.",
      "\"We're taking over every institution of government,\" one prominent Trump ally told me. \"This is not a transition. You do understand that, right? We're taking over and it starts with the Senate.\"",
      "But for all the blunt talk about the Senate race, Trump has not taken sides and all indications are that he won't. One key factor, sources close to the president-elect say, is that Trump doesn't think Rick Scott can win the race and the last thing he wants to do is endorse a loser.",
      "Even without that endorsement, Scott is running as the one real pro-Trump candidate in the race, saying under his leadership the Senate agenda will be \"identical to the Trump agenda.\"",
      "Thune and Cornyn both endorsed Trump and say they are also committed to passing the Trump agenda.",
      "But both have also shown a willingness to occasionally stand up to Trump. After he voted to acquit Trump in the Senate impeachment trial in February 2021, for example, Thune said: \"My vote to acquit should not be viewed as exoneration for his conduct on January 6 \u2026 or in the days and weeks leading up to it. What former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable.\"",
      "Cornyn has said Trump used \"reckless and incendiary speech\" on Jan. 6. and criticized Trump's handling of COVID-19.",
      "While Trump himself has not endorsed any candidate, over the weekend he made two big demands of all three of them: 1) He wants them to promise confirm cabinet secretaries without a vote in the Senate if necessary (through the use of so-called \"recess appointments\"); and, 2) He wants them to block confirmations of any judges while the Democrats still control the Senate.",
      "Scott responded almost immediately, announcing on X he would go along with Trump's demands: \"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\"",
      "In a sign of Trump's influence, Thune and Cornyn also expressed support for Trump's demand, both saying they are committed to doing everything possible to quickly confirm Trump's nominations and saying they are open to recess appointments, too.",
      "But if either Thune or Cornyn emerges as the next Republican leader in the Senate, it may be a sign that Trump\u2019s influence is not unlimited \u2013 or, at that very least, that a Republican leader can show some independence and still survive in Trump\u2019s Republican Party."

      "\"Clearly, you're thinking and working about the day after as well, which perhaps should be a trajectory of hope to the people of the region and the ability to have our neighbors, as well as us, live in security and peace,\" Herzog added. \"But first and foremost, we have to get the hostages back.\"",
      "\"I agree,\" Biden said.",

      "Biden hosted Herzog amid international concerns that Israel is still failing to facilitate adequate humanitarian aid flows into Gaza.",
      "The Biden administration gave Israel a 30-day window to \"surge\" food and emergency aid into the devastated territory last month, warning that failure to address the issue may trigger U.S. laws requiring restrictions on military aid to Israel. The deadline for progress is Tuesday.",
      "A letter signed by several international aid agencies and published Tuesday said Israel has failed to address the concerns. The \"situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago,\" the groups wrote, per a report by The Associated Press.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar appeared to downplay the situation on Monday, telling reporters that \"the issue would be solved.\"",

    "story": [
      "Noem has taken an aggressive stance on immigration over the years.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to soon announce he has chosen South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be his secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, sources told ABC News on Tuesday.",
      "When news of her potential appointment was first reported by CNN earlier Tuesday, some Republicans expressed concern -- but it doesn't appear it has changed the direction of Trump's pick, the sources said. The role would require Senate approval.",
      "As Trump's Homeland Security secretary, among Noem's biggest roles is expected to be to oversee Trump's border policies, including the major campaign promise of \"mass deportations,\" alongside Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan and White House deputy chief of staff on policy Stephen Miller.",
      "Noem has taken a similarly aggressive stance on immigration over the years.",
      "In 2017, while serving as the state's at-large representative in the U.S. Congress, she supported Trump's so-called \"Muslim travel ban,\" saying she shares Trump's \"concerns about our ability to screen refugees -- especially those from terrorist hotbed areas.\"",
      "In 2021, she opposed Afghan refugees coming into South Dakota amid the U.S. troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan, even though she had accepted Syrian refugees under the Trump administration in 2019. Earlier this year, she spent millions of dollars of the state's Emergency and Disaster Fund to deploy the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas.",
      "After Trump's victory in the election, Noem expressed excitement over Trump's immigration plans, praising the president-elect's deportation and border plans in multiple interviews.",
      "In an interview on NewsNation on Friday, when asked about the potential cost of the mass deportations promised by Trump, Noem said, \"It is going to be a big operation, and President Trump has already indicated that he wants to start by making sure that we're deporting the most dangerous first -- those criminals, murderers, rapists, that are threatening safety in our communities -- they're going to be the first ones on the list to go.\"",
      "On Thursday, Noem said in an interview on Newsmax that Trump's \"No. 1 priority is going to be this border. We've got to secure our country, and we've got to get the murderers and terrorists and rapists out of this country, and make America safe again. That's really what his goal is. And I'm just so proud of him that he's working so hard at it immediately.\"",
      "Noem officially endorsed Trump at a rally in South Dakota in September last year and has been actively campaigning for him since -- including holding Trump surrogate events leading up to the critical Iowa caucuses, courting donors at fundraisers and serving as one of Trump's surrogates at the ABC News presidential debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "At one point earlier this election cycle, Noem was among several names floated as possible contenders for Trump's running mate. She had been open about her desire to join a possible second Trump administration, saying she would join the Trump ticket \"in a heartbeat\" and saying \"I'll help him however I can,\" even as she stressed she loves being South Dakota's governor.",
      "Earlier this year, she was embroiled in a series of controversies, including drawing scrutiny and a lawsuit over her social media endorsement of a dental work she received from a practice in Texas.",
      "She was also criticized for writing in her new memoir about how she shot and killed her 14-month-old dog \"Cricket\" after it demonstrated an \"aggressive personality, and was forced to admit what she called \"errors\" in her book including claiming she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That description was removed from the book, according to the publisher.",
      "Still, Trump defended and praised her amid controversies last year, saying she's gone through \"rough\" days but that he likes her \"a lot.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump is currently set to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but that could now change.",
      "The judge in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case in New York agreed Tuesday to delay any decision on whether to throw out Trump's conviction based on the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision on presidential immunity.",
      "Judge Juan Merchan was scheduled on Tuesday to decide the fate of the case, but both sides requested more time to consider how to proceed now that Trump is president-elect.",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" prosecutors wrote in an email to the judge.",
      "Judge Merchan gave prosecutors until Nov. 19 to recommend next steps.",
      "\"As per the People's request, the People are to file with the Court, off calendar, your view of appropriate steps going forward,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "A jury convicted Trump in May of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniel to silence allegations about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "Sentencing in the case is currently scheduled for Nov. 26, less than two months ahead of Trump's inauguration, but Tuesday's decision could change that.",
      "While the $130,000 payment preceded Trump's ascension to the presidency, Trump has claimed that prosecutors filled \"glaring holes in their case\" with evidence that related to official acts he subsequently performed in office -- which the Supreme Court ruled are off limits in its July ruling on presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors have argued that the case centers on \"entirely personal\" conduct with \"no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency.\"",
      "\"[T]he evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Defense attorneys have argued certain evidence -- including Trump's conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks and Trump's social media posts as president -- tainted the jury's understanding of the case.",
      "In one example cited by prosecutors, Hicks testified that Trump said he preferred the story about his hush money payment come out after the election, suggesting he was aware the allegations by Daniels could have impacted the race. In his closing statement, a prosecutor described the testimony as the final \"nail in Mr. Trump's coffin.\"",
      "In response, prosecutors have argued that the testimony from Hicks \"related solely to unofficial conduct\" and would not be considered immune.",
      "Trump has asked that the verdict be overturned or the case be thrown out entirely. If Judge Merchan tosses the conviction, he could order a new trial -- which would be delayed for at least four years until Trump leaves office -- or dismiss the indictment altogether.",
      "Merchan has already delayed the sentencing twice -- first following the immunity decision in July, and again in September to \"to avoid any appearance -- however unwarranted -- that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election,\" the judge said.",
      "Following Trump's election victory, he is set to be inaugurated less than two months from his sentencing date, which limits Merchan's options for punishing the president-elect, according to experts.",
      "Trump's conviction carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, though first-time offenders normally receive lesser sentences.",
      "In the meantime, special counsel Jack Smith is expected to drop both of Trump's federal criminal cases -- related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and retain classified documents after leaving the White House -- based on a longstanding Department of Justice policy prohibiting the prosecution of sitting presidents. Trump's criminal election interference case in Georgia has also been mired in delays, leaving his New York conviction as the last of his criminal hurdles before he regains the presidency.",
      "In his September order delaying the sentencing until this month, Judge Merchan described the case as \"one that stands alone, in a unique place in this Nation's history\"",

      "The city of Florence is taking new measures to crack down on overtourism",
      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "Donald Trump has long criticized America's spy agencies, accusing them of trying to undermine his first administration and campaign to retake the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has long viewed the nation's spy services with suspicion, accusing them of trying to undermine his first term and campaigns. Now that he's returning to the White House, Trump's promises to overhaul the U.S. intelligence agencies put him on a collision course with one of most secretive and powerful parts of government.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that he is nominating John Ratcliffe to lead the CIA. A former Republican congressman from Texas, Ratcliffe served as director of national intelligence for the final months of Trump\u2019s first term, leading the U.S. government\u2019s spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Ratcliffe is a more traditional pick for the position, which requires Senate confirmation, than some rumored loyalists pushed by some of Trump\u2019s supporters.",
      "For the CIA and other intelligence agencies, the start of Trump's second administration is a way to reset an often challenging relationship with a leader who has in the past dismissed them as the deepest of the deep state \u2014 Trump's label for the thousands of career federal employees that carry out the work of government regardless of who is president.",
      "For Trump, the return to power offers an opportunity to follow through on promises to clean house of officials that he believes have tried to challenge his leadership and criticize his actions.",
      "Former and current intelligence officials also are watching for clues indicating whether Trump will use U.S. intelligence to inform foreign policy and national security decisions or whether he will realize the fears of critics, who worry he could spill classified secrets or seek to weaponize intelligence work against Americans.",
      "\u201cIf he comes in committed to retribution and cleaning house, that\u2019s going to impact the agency. We're going to lose people, and there's going to be this fear: \u2018What will get me in trouble politically?\u2019\u201d said Douglas London, a 34-year CIA veteran who now writes about intelligence work and teaches at Georgetown University.",
      "In selecting Ratcliffe to lead the nation's premier spy agency, Trump chose a loyalist who has been willing to defend him in some of his most politically charged battles in Washington. When serving in the House, Ratcliffe was on Trump's advisory team during his first impeachment proceedings.",
      "As intelligence director during the final days of the 2020 election, Ratcliffe angered Democrats by declassifying Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true.",
      "Given his experience in Congress and the intelligence community, Ratcliffe is seen as a relatively traditional pick for the position of CIA director. House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, hailed Trump's selection in a statement, saying Ratcliffe \u201cknows what it will take\" to lead the agency and counter threats posed by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Ratcliffe will be responsible for carrying out any changes Trump has in mind for the CIA. Trump signaled his intentions the day after he won his second term.",
      "\u201cWe will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,\u201d Trump said in a video released last week. \u201cThe departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled.\u201d",
      "In an effort to head off any difficulties with the president-elect, intelligence agencies are emphasizing their nonpartisan mission and their usefulness to any new president looking to understand a globe complicated by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and the growing partnership between China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.",
      "London said that in his experience, intelligence officials work hard to avoid any appearance of partisanship and put their constitutional oaths ahead of politics.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very little agency officials can do,\u201d London added, \u201cother than to show: \u2018We\u2019re here, we\u2019re on your team, we\u2019re here to support you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Intelligence officials won't say if Trump has already received an intelligence briefing, but the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement saying it is following a standard procedure for new presidents that dates to Dwight Eisenhower's election.",
      "\u201cODNI is acting consistent with the tradition, in place since 1952, of providing intelligence briefings to the president-elect,\" the office wrote.",
      "During his time in the White House or on the campaign trail, Trump has been anything but traditional, displaying an animosity toward the nation\u2019s spy agencies unlike any seen since Richard Nixon, who believed the CIA and other agencies sought to undermine his presidency.",
      "Trump often railed against the CIA and other spy agencies, accusing them of working to undermine his first administration and seeking to prevent him from retaking the White House. He also has blamed intelligence officials for questioning his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump received fewer intelligence briefings as president than any other recent commander in chief. In 2021, President Joe Biden suggested that Trump should no longer receive the standard intelligence briefings given to former presidents, calling Trump \u201cerratic.\u201d",
      "Trump also was accused of mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate \u2014 a case now stalled in the courts that prosecutors are seeking to wind down following the election.",
      "Trump's win gives him a mandate to carry out his vision for national security and intelligence, said Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the first Trump administration.",
      "Colby said wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, along with China's growing rivalry, show Trump doesn't have time to be delicate with the nation's national security and intelligence agencies, likening them to the Titanic heading toward an iceberg.",
      "\u201cIf you turn the Titanic 90 degrees, people are going to fall out of their bunks, chandeliers and beautiful plates are going to get broken,\" Colby said Sunday on Tucker Carlson's internet show. \u201cBut that's where we are. ... President Trump ran against the system.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- After spending four months in federal prison for snubbing a congressional subpoena, conservative strategist Steve Bannon had a message Tuesday for prosecutors in cases against him and President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cYou wait. The hunted are about to become the hunters,\u201d Bannon said outside a New York court where he's now facing a state conspiracy trial as soon as next month.",

      "The longtime Trump ally's latest trial is set to start Dec. 9 \u2014 but could be postponed after a hearing Monday \u2014 at the same Manhattan courthouse where the past-and-next president was convicted in his hush money case. Separately, a judge Tuesday delayed a key ruling in the hush money case for at least a week as prosecutors ponder how to proceed in light of Trump's impending presidency.",
      "Bannon cast Trump's election win as a \u201cverdict on all this lawfare.\u201d Voters, he said, \u201crejected what\u2019s going on in this court.\u201d",
      "The former Trump 2016 campaign CEO and White House strategist is charged with conspiring to dupe people who contributed money to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy and money laundering in the case, which mirrors an aborted federal prosecution. That was in its early stages when Trump pardoned Bannon in 2021, during the last hours of the Republican's first presidential term.",
      "The following year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James revived the case in state court, where presidential pardons don't apply. Both are Democrats.",
      "Bannon and others involved with a charity called WeBuildTheWall Inc. told the public and donors that every dollar they gave would go to the wall-building effort, prosecutors say. But, they say, Bannon helped steer at least $140,000 of the nonprofit's money to its president for a secret salary.",
      "Bannon's indictment mostly accuses him of facilitating the payouts, not getting them himself, though it suggests he passed along only a portion of the WeBuildTheWall money that came under his control.",
      "Prosecutors told a court Tuesday that some of the money was used to pay Bannon's credit card bill, and they'd like to be able to present evidence of those transactions at his trial.",
      "\u201cHe saw an opportunity to use that money to forward his political agenda, and he did that,\u201d prosecutor Jeffrey Levinson said.",
      "Defense lawyer John Carman said Bannon was simply reimbursed for expenses he incurred while traveling to the border to help WeBuildTheWall's cause. Bannon chaired the group's advisory board.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re attempting to smear Mr. Bannon by showing that he took money,\u201d Carman said. \u201cThe money that he was taking was money that he was entitled to take.\u201d",
      "He asked Judge April Newbauer to delay the trial, saying that the defense would need to line up financial and nonprofit experts to rebut the evidence that prosecutors are seeking to introduce.",
      "Newbauer scheduled a hearing Monday to decide whether to allow that evidence. She said she'd decide afterward whether to postpone the trial.",
      "Bannon, 70, appeared to be at ease during Tuesday's hearing, which came less than two weeks after he was freed from a federal prison in Connecticut. A jury had convicted him of contempt of Congress for not giving a deposition and not providing documents for the body's investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.",

      "Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has been sentenced to 45 days in prison after repeatedly violating probation, disappointing a federal judge who rewarded his cooperation in a criminal case against him with leniency five years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was sentenced Tuesday to 45 days in prison by a federal judge who said repeated violations of his probation after his cooperation against a violent gang won him leniency in a criminal case show that he doesn't have sufficient respect for judicial system rules.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the additional time be spent behind bars five years after giving the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez a two-year prison sentence that likely would have been decades behind bars if he had not testified at trial against the violent gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "The Manhattan judge said that five violations of probation rules including failing to show up for drug tests, traveling to Las Vegas from his Florida home without permission and lying to his probation officer \u201csay to me loud and clear that you don't believe the rules apply to you.\u201d",
      "He questioned whether Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, thought he was above the law \u201cmaybe because you\u2019re a famous and wealthy rapper.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the same rules do apply to you,\u201d Englemayer said.",
      "Before the judge announced the jail time, Tekashi 6ix9ine asked for mercy, saying he was disappointed in himself for having to face him again just a half year before his probation would have expired.",
      "\u201cI'm very sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not minimizing my actions. I fully take responsibility. I let myself down. I let my family down. Give me an opportunity to clean things up.\u201d",
      "He said he didn't want the judge to \u201cthink of me as ill mannered or I'm a bad person,\" and he insisted that \u201cI don't go out of my way to break the law.\u201d",
      "After his jail stint is finished, Tekashi 6ix9ine will be subject to a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfews as apart of an extension of his probation period by one year. He also will not be allowed to travel internationally and will face electronic monitoring.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was granted compassionate release from prison several months before his sentence was finished because asthma made him susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation\u2019s jails and prisons.",
      "He was arrested on Oct. 29 and has spent the past two weeks in solitary confinement, a particularly harsh detainment that the judge described as a reason why he didn't impose a three-month jail term.",
      "In 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine was arrested on charges accusing him of joining Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods before trying to get others to commit violence against his perceived enemies.",
      "Engelmayer said the singer's parole violations weren't \u201cgravely serious,\u201d but they were \u201cprofound\u201d breaches of the court's trust.",
      "He also said Tekashi 6ix9ine has \u201crepeatedly flown very close to the flame\u201d as he cited two instances in which he was arrested in the Dominican Republic and a speeding violation for allegedly going 136 mph in a 65 mph zone.",
      "\u201cYour repeated brushes with the law underscore the need to get this message across to you,\u201d the judge said."

      "Photos of Interstate 40 with multiple lanes washed out by Helene near the Tennessee state line garnered widespread attention in the days after the storm as the region was largely cut off by numerous road closures.",
      "Emergency workers from Tennessee and North Carolina responded to a report of a crash involving a vehicle that went off the collapsed road and down an embankment on eastbound I-40 on Saturday night, according to a news release from the Junaluska Community Volunteer Fire Department.",
      "Crews rappelled down the embankment to reach the vehicle on its side about 100 feet (30 meters) from the road, the fire department said. Images from the scene show a worker trying to reach the crumpled, white vehicle at the bottom of a steep, rubble-covered slope. The driver, the only person in the vehicle, was extricated and taken to a hospital.",
      "The driver, identified as Patricia Mahoney, 63, of Southern Pines, North Carolina, died later that night, according to Sgt. Brandon Miller of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, which is investigating the cause of the crash. She got on the highway around the 7-mile marker, headed westbound in eastbound lanes and went off the road around the 4-mile marker where the road ends. An autopsy is scheduled. There's no indication of why she went around the barricade, Miller said.",
      "The highway has been closed since late September when flood waters from Hurricane Helene washed away the interstate\u2019s eastbound lanes in four long swaths along the Pigeon River, but the North Carolina Department of Transportation has said it expects to reopen one lane in each direction by the new year."

      "ATLANTA -- Local officials are beginning to certify the results of this year\u2019s presidential election in a process that, so far, has been playing out quietly, in stark contrast to the tumultuous certification period four years ago that followed then-President Donald Trump\u2019s loss.",
      "Georgia was the first of the presidential battleground states to start certifying, with local election boards voting throughout the day Tuesday. As counties certified their results without controversy, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hailed Georgia\u2019s election as \u201cfree, fair and fast.\u201d",
      "Trump won Georgia and the six other presidential battleground states, after losing six of them to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. County certification meetings are scheduled later in the week in several other swing states \u2014 Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin.",
      "The lack of certification drama so far this week is a return to how the typically routine process worked before Trump lost his bid for reelection four years ago. As he sought then to overturn the will of the voters, he and his allies pressured Republican members of certification boards in Michigan to delay or halt the process. They also sought to delay certifications in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.",
      "The boards ultimately voted to certify, but Trump\u2019s focus on certification caught on among Republicans. Some local Republican officials have refused to certify results in elections since then, raising concerns of a wider movement to reject certification this year had Trump lost to Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Some of that sentiment was present on Tuesday. Michael Heekin, a Republican member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections said he disagreed that certifying election results \u201cis purely a ministerial duty.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe should be the first line of defense, at least one of the lines of defense in examining the goodness and the accuracy of the election,\u201d he said.",
      "A lawyer for the county, which includes heavily Democratic Atlanta, explained during the meeting that certification was a necessary step before any election challenge could proceed. The county election board certified the results late Tuesday.",
      "Unlike Trump four years ago, Harris acknowledged her loss and conceded. Trump also won the popular vote for the first time during his three runs for the White House and praised the election results. Rather than descending on county ballot counting centers in anger, his supporters have been jubilant.",
      "\u201cThis time four years ago, I was getting nasty phone calls constantly in my office,\u201d said Lisa Tollefson, the elections clerk in Rock County, Wisconsin. This year, she said, \u201cit\u2019s been very quiet.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not to say everyone is happy. Conspiracy theories surrounding this year\u2019s election are circulating within both parties.",
      "Following Election Day, left-wing conspiracy theories proliferated on TikTok, X and other social platforms as users questioned why Harris\u2019 total vote count was around 60 million \u2014 about 20 million fewer votes than Biden received four years ago.",
      "Some right-wing accounts twisted the narrative, falsely claiming the vote gap was instead proof that Biden\u2019s 2020 tally must have included fake votes.",
      "The claims didn\u2019t consider the fact that tabulation would take several days, including in Arizona and California, the nation\u2019s most populous state. As votes continue to be counted this week, Harris has made up ground and now has nearly 72 million votes, a number that will continue to grow.",
      "Counties and other local jurisdictions across the country will be conducting post-election audits of the vote over the next few weeks. Those typically involve hand-counting a certain number of ballots and comparing the results to machine tallies to ensure accuracy.",
      "Before local results are certified, the top election official typically provides the vote totals by candidate in each race along with how many voters cast ballots and how many total ballots were cast. Any discrepancies get reported and explained.",
      "\u201cThe whole point of this period is to find those types of errors,\u201d said Kim Wyman, the former top election official in Washington state. \u201cThey are making sure the results were accurate, that the election was accurate.\u201d",
      "Every state will be going through the process, including presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Election certification meetings start Wednesday in Nevada, which backed a Republican in the presidential race for the first time in 20 years. The state's 17 counties have until Friday to certify, while Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, and the Nevada Supreme Court must meet by Nov. 26 to finalize the statewide results.",
      "Arizona's 15 counties must certify by Nov. 21 and forward the results to the governor and secretary of state \u2014 both of whom are Democrats \u2014 for statewide certification four days later.",
      "In North Carolina, where election officials recovered quickly after Hurricane Helene devastated the western part of the state, election boards in all 100 counties were scheduled to meet Friday to certify results.",
      "Pennsylvania counties have until Nov. 25 to certify. Some larger counties were still reviewing and counting provisional ballots on Tuesday, the deadline for them to report unofficial results to the state. Litigation was possible with a U.S. Senate race hovering near the threshold for an automatic statewide recount.",
      "Michigan\u2019s 83 county canvassing boards have until Nov. 19 to review local results before forwarding them to the Board of State Canvassers. The four-member board, comprised of two Democrats and two Republicans, is scheduled to certify the results by Nov. 25.",
      "In Wisconsin, counties began the canvass process on Tuesday and have until Nov. 19 to certify. The Wisconsin Elections Commission will review the county reports and the chair \u2014 currently a Democrat \u2014 will certify the results by Dec. 1.",
      "The biggest potential problem in the state was identified on Election Day and corrected. Vote-tabulating machines used for mail ballots in Milwaukee were not properly sealed. A bipartisan decision was made to start over the process of counting the ballots once the problem was addressed.",

      "BATON ROUGE, LA. -- A new Louisiana requirement that the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public classrooms is \u201cunconstitutional on its face,\" a federal judge ruled Tuesday, ordering state education officials not to take steps to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",
      "U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge said the law had an \u201covertly religious\u201d purpose, and rejected state officials' claims that the government can mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments because they hold historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law.

      "That, Murrill said in a Tuesday interview, leaves Louisiana's 67 other school systems subject to the law. However, she acknowledged that deGravelles' order could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on any local board's decision to enforce the law.",
      "\u201cThe order itself creates confusion with regard to whether other school boards are subject to it,\u201d Murrill said. \u201cLegally, they\u2019re not. But I think it\u2019s plain intent was to create confusion.\u201d",
      "Murrill, a Republican who joined Gov. Jeff Landry in supporting the law, said the state disagrees with deGravelles' finding that the law conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and said she hopes the 5th Circuit stays his order quickly.",
      "DeGravelles ordered the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, state Superintendent Cade Brumley and five local school boards that are named as defendants in the case not to take any steps to enforce the requirement. The board and Brumley were also ordered to notify all local school boards that the law is unconstitutional. Murrill issued a statement Tuesday saying",
      "In granting a preliminary injunction, DeGravelles said opponents of the law are likely to win their ongoing lawsuit against the law. The lawsuit argues that the law violates the First Amendment's provisions forbidding the government from establishing a religion or blocking the free exercise of religion. They had argued that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian.",
      "DeGravelles said the law amounts to unconstitutional religious government coercion of students: \u201cAs Plaintiffs highlight, by law, parents must send their minor children to school and ensure attendance during regular school hours at least 177 days per year.\u201d",
      "Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "Plaintiffs in the case were a group of parents of Louisiana public school children.",
      "The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state's GOP-dominated Legislature earlier this year.",
      "The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including President-elect Donald Trump, is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms \u2014 from Florida legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to counsel students to Oklahoma\u2019s top education official ordering public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons.",
      "In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect.",
      "In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the First Amendment establishment, which says Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s legislation, which applies to all public K-12 schools and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 11 inches by 14 inches (28 by 36 centimeters) where the text is the central focus and \u201cprinted in a large, easily readable font.\u201d",
      "Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph \u201ccontext statement\u201d describing how the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say schools are not required to spend public money on the posters, and instead that they can be bought using donations or that groups and organizations will donate the actual posters.",

      "Control of the U.S. House rests on just over a dozen races where winners have not yet been determined",
      "WASHINGTON -- One week after Election Day, control of the U.S. House rests on just over a dozen races where winners have not yet been determined.",
      "Nine states have at least one uncalled House race, some of which are so close they are headed to a recount.",
      "Then there\u2019s California. About half of the yet-to-be-decided House races are in the state, which has only counted about three-quarters of its votes statewide.",
      "This isn\u2019t unusual or unexpected, as the nation\u2019s most populous state is consistently among the slowest to report all its election results. Compare it to a state like Florida, the third-largest, which finished counting its votes four days after Election Day.",
      "The same was true four years ago, when Florida reported the results of nearly 99% of ballots cast within a few hours of polls closing. In California, almost one-third of ballots were uncounted after election night, and the state was making almost daily updates to its count through Dec. 3, a full month after Election Day.",
      "These differences in how states count \u2014 and how long it takes \u2014 exist because the Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government, but leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot to how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place, how elections are kept secure and how officials maintain voters\u2019 confidence in the process.",
      "The gap between when California and Florida are able to finalize their count is the natural result of election officials in the two states choosing to emphasize different concerns and set different priorities. Here's a look at the differences:",
      "Lawmakers in California designed their elections to improve accessibility and increase turnout. Whether it\u2019s automatically receiving a ballot at home, having up until Election Day to turn it in or having several days to address any problems that may arise with their ballot, Californians have a lot of time and opportunity to vote. It comes at the expense of knowing the final vote counts soon after polls close.",
      "\u201cOur priority is trying to maximize participation of actively registered voters,\u201d said Democratic Assemblymember Marc Berman, who authored the 2021 bill that permanently switched the state to all-mail elections. \u201cWhat that means is things are a little slower. But in a society that wants immediate gratification, I think our democracy is worth taking a little time to get it right and to create a system where everyone can participate.\u201d",
      "California, which has long had a culture of voting absentee, started moving toward all-mail elections last decade. All-mail systems will almost always prolong the count. Mail ballots require additional verification steps \u2014 each must be opened individually, validated and processed \u2014 so they can take longer to tabulate than ballots cast in person that are then fed into a scanner at a neighborhood polling place.",
      "In 2016, California passed a bill allowing counties to opt in to all-mail elections before instituting it statewide on a temporary basis in 2020 and enshrining it in law in time for the 2022 elections.",
      "Studies found that the earliest states to institute all-mail elections \u2013 Oregon and Washington \u2013 saw higher turnout. Mail ballots also increase the likelihood of a voter casting a complete ballot, according to Melissa Michelson, a political scientist and dean at California\u2019s Menlo College who has written on voter mobilization.",
      "In recent years, the thousands of California voters who drop off their mail ballots on Election Day created a bottleneck on election night. In the past five general elections, California has tabulated an average of 38% of its vote after Election Day. Two years ago, in the 2022 midterm elections, half the state\u2019s votes were counted after Election Day.",
      "Slower counts have come alongside later mail ballot deadlines. In 2015, California implemented its first postmark deadline, meaning that the state can count mail ballots that arrive after Election Day as long as the Postal Service receives the ballot by Election Day. Berman said the postmark deadline allows the state to treat the mailbox as a drop box in order to avoid punishing voters who cast their ballots properly but are affected by postal delays.",
      "Initially, the law said ballots that arrived within three days of the election would be considered cast in time. This year, ballots may arrive up to a week after Election Day, so California won\u2019t know how many ballots have been cast until Nov. 12. This deadline means that California will be counting ballots at least through that week because ballots arriving up to that point might still be valid and be added to the count.",
      "Florida\u2019s election system is geared toward quick and efficient tabulation. Coming out of its disastrous 2000 presidential election, when the U.S. Supreme Court settled a recount dispute and George W. Bush was declared the winner in the state over Al Gore, the state moved to standardize its election systems and clean up its canvass, or the process of confirming votes cast and counted.",
      "Republican Rep. Bill Posey, who as state senator was the sponsor of the Florida Election Reform Act of 2001, said the two goals of the law \u2014 to count all legal votes and to ensure voters are confident their votes are counted \u2014 were accomplished by mandating optical ballot scanners in every precinct. That \u201cmost significant\u201d change means no more \u201changing chads\u201d in Florida. The scanners read and aggregate results from paper ballots, immediately spitting back any that contain mistakes.",
      "Florida\u2019s deadlines are set to avoid having ballots arrive any later than when officials press \u201cgo\u201d on the tabulator machines. The state has a receipt deadline for its absentee ballots, which means ballots that do not arrive by 7 p.m. local time on Election Day are not counted, regardless of when they were mailed.",
      "Michael T. Morley, a professor of election law at Florida State University College of Law, pointed out that Florida election officials may begin processing ballots, but not actually count them, before polls close. That helps speed up the process, especially compared with states that don\u2019t allow officials to process mail ballots before Election Day.",
      "\u201cThey can determine the validity of ballots, confirm they should be counted and run them through machines,\u201d Morley said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t press the tally button.\u201d",
      "Florida takes steps to avoid a protracted back-and-forth on potentially problematic ballots. At the precinct, optical scanners catch some problems, such as a voter selecting too many candidates, that can be fixed on-site. Also, any voter who\u2019s returned a mail ballot with a mismatched or missing signature has until 5 p.m. two days after the election to submit an affidavit fixing it. California gives voters up to four weeks after the election to address such inconsistencies.",

      "A writer for a conservative media outlet has pleaded guilty to joining a mob\u2019s attack on the U.S. Capitol nearly years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- A writer for a conservative media outlet pleaded guilty on Tuesday to joining a mob\u2019s attack on the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago, after a federal judge refused to pause his case until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Steve Baker, who has written articles about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot for Blaze News, entered his guilty plea on the day that his bench trial had been scheduled to begin.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper is scheduled to sentence Baker on March 6, but the judge acknowledged that the case may never reach the punishment stage. Trump has repeatedly vowed to issue pardons to Jan. 6 riot defendants.",
      "Baker, 64, of Durham, North Carolina, had asked Cooper to postpone all of the deadlines and hearings for his case until after Trump's inauguration. But the judge denied Baker\u2019s request. Other judges have rejected similar requests by Capitol riot defendants who hope Trump will pardon them.",
      "After his guilty plea, Baker told reporters that he is \"very confident that I'm at the top of the list\" if Trump hands out pardons. Baker said he pleaded guilty \u201cto avoid the shaming exercise of a trial\u201d and maintained that he didn't do anything wrong on Jan. 6.",
      "\u201cI don't have a regret about my behavior that day,\u201d he said outside the courthouse.",
      "Blaze News is part of an online platform that conservative political commentator Glenn Beck founded in 2011 after leaving Fox News. Baker started writing for the media outlet after the Jan. 6 siege. He was working as a freelance journalist on Jan. 6 and later sold videos of the riot to The New York Times and HBO.",
      "Baker\u2019s coverage of the Jan. 6 attack included the trial of Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and four associates charged with seditious conspiracy for a plot to keep Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 election. Baker covered the trial from a courthouse room reserved for news reporters.",
      "Baker was arrested and charged in March with four misdemeanor counts, including trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. He pleaded guilty to all four counts.",
      "After the riot erupted, Baker entered the Capitol through a broken door and joined the mob at the barricaded doors to the House chamber, according to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit.",
      "In another part of the Capitol, the affidavit says, Baker \u201cantagonized\u201d police officers who tried to keep him on the other side of a doorjamb, repeatedly asking, \u201cAre you going to use that (gun) on us?\u201d He remained inside the building for approximately 37 minutes before police led him out of the Capitol, according to the FBI.",
      "The affidavit cites statements that Baker made during and after the riot. After leaving the Capitol, he told a local television station that he was \u201cquite excited to see this going on.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I approve of what happened today? I approve 100%,\u201d he said, according to the affidavit.",
      "Baker also told the station that approximately 20 to 30 people were inside then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office \u201cat the time that I got there.\u201d In a video uploaded to a YouTube channel on Jan. 6, Baker also referred to Pelosi with a sexist expletive.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I regret is that I didn\u2019t like steal their computers because God knows what I could\u2019ve found on their computers if I\u2019d done that. But by the time I got into Pelosi\u2019s office, unfortunately there was some damage done,\u201d Baker said, according to the FBI.",
      "Cooper said he was troubled by Baker's rhetoric that day.",
      "\u201cIf you haven't reassessed those comments, I'm not sure there's anything I could say today that would change your mind,\u201d the judge added.",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Over 1,000 convicted rioters have been sentenced, with over 650 receiving prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",
      "Cooper said the Jan. 6 prosecutions have been decided by facts and evidence, exemplifying the rule of law.",
      "\u201cThey have not been governed by unsupported opinions and conspiracy theories,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Baker and his attorneys accused the Justice Department of selectively prosecuting him for his political beliefs. But the judge rejected that claim, calling it \u201cunfounded speculation.\u201d",

    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule announced by the Biden administration",
    "story": [
      "Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule announced by the Biden administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane \u2014 the primary component of natural gas \u2014 and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, announced at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes a day after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Joe Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule will not become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden\u2019s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\u201d he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry\u2019s largest lobbying group, said the fee \u201champers our ability to meet the growing energy needs of American families and businesses and fails to advance meaningful emissions reduction.\"",
      "API senior vice president Dustin Meyer said the group looks forward to working with the Trump administration and the new Congress to repeal the fee and \u201cget this right.\"",
      "Environmental groups hailed the new fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it\u2019s cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "\u201cWhile we expect the next administration to recklessly greenlight fossil fuel extraction, it\u2019s heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,\u201d said Maggie Coulter, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, an advocacy group.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction,\" Coulter said. \u201cThe oil and gas companies doing so much damage to our climate should have to pay for the methane leaks they\u2019ve so outrageously failed to fix.\u201d",

      "Wisconsin Republicans have reelected Robin Vos as the speaker of the state Assembly",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin Republicans reelected Robin Vos as the speaker of the state Assembly on Tuesday, a position he has held longer than anyone in state history and that he reclaimed despite a challenge from a more conservative lawmaker and Democratic gains in the election.",
      "The speaker is the most powerful position in the Assembly and Vos, who has held the post since 2013, will preside over the smallest Republican majority in 18 years. Vos was challenged by Rep. Scott Allen, who supported impeaching the state's nonpartisan election leader. Vos opposed impeachment.",
      "The vote on Vos was held in secret and he did not say at a news conference how the vote broke down. Allen did not attend the news conference.",
      "Vos overcame opposition among some conservatives in his party and a stormy relationship with President-elect Donald Trump. Vos has frequently butted heads with Trump, most notably after his 2020 defeat when Vos refused to decertify President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Trump endorsed a Republican challenger to Vos in 2022 and Trump backers mounted unsuccessful recall attempts targeting Vos this year.",
      "Vos got behind new legislative maps this year that were drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, partly out of fear that the liberal-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court could enact something even worse for Republicans. The Legislature approved the Evers map, which allowed Democrats to cut into Republican majorities in the Senate and Assembly but not enough to flip control.",
      "Some Democrats had hoped to gain a majority in the Assembly, but Republicans won enough key districts to maintain control. Under the new maps, the Republican majority in the Assembly dropped from 64-35 to 54-45 and in the Senate it dropped from 22-11 to 18-15. During Vos' time as speaker, Republicans have held between 60 and 64 seats.",
      "Republican Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August said Democrats had an \u201catrocious\u201d election because they could not take control \u201con a map that they had engineered to put themselves in the majority.\u201d",
      "Still, the more narrow majorities could lead to more compromise between the Legislature and Evers. But Vos said Republicans would continue to bring forward issues where there is broad consensus among them, like cutting taxes, but others where there is less agreement, like legalizing medical marijuana, would be more difficult.",
      "Evers, who rarely met with Republican legislative leaders last session, said he hoped there would be more compromise.",
      "\u201cFair maps matter,\u201d Evers posted on the social media platform X on Monday. \u201cI look forward to working together next session with a Legislature that is more collaborative, more cooperative, and more responsive to the will of the people.\u201d",
      "Evers will submit a new two-year state budget early next year. Evers and Republicans were able to reach agreement last session on increasing state aid to local governments and extending the lease on American Family Field to keep the Milwaukee Brewers in Wisconsin.",
      "Evers signed a budget last year that cut taxes, but not as much as Republicans proposed, and he used his veto power to increase school funding, a move that Republicans are challenging in court. Evers has pushed for a wide array of policy and funding proposals that Republicans have blocked, including expanding paid family leave and Medicaid, legalizing marijuana, and increasing the minimum wage.",
      "Senate Republicans reelected Sen. Devin LeMahieu as their majority leader last week. Senate Democrats reelected Sen. Dianne Hesselbein as minority leader on Tuesday. Assembly Democrats were meeting Nov. 19 to elect their leaders."

      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d Amiri said in a statement.",
      "The plaintiff in the new lawsuit said the decision whether to end her pregnancy should be hers.",
      "\"I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community,\u201d she said."

      "With destructive wildfires burning on both coasts, fire officials might use jargon unfamiliar to residents of states where such big blazes are relatively rare",
      "LOS ANGELES -- With destructive wildfires burning on both coasts, fire officials might use jargon unfamiliar to residents of states where such big blazes are relatively rare.",
      "Here's an explainer of some wildfire terminology:",
      "Authorities will give daily updates about the percentage of containment that firefighters have reached. For example, when a blaze is 25% contained, it means crews have constructed a fire line around a quarter of its perimeter. A fire line is often a dirt trail built by firefighters using bulldozers or hand shovels that separates the blaze from the grass, brush and trees that feed the flames. In some cases, the lines will be reinforced by flame retardant dropped by aircraft. Fire lines can also include natural breaks such as roads, rocky areas or rivers. A fire line is also known as a fuel break.",
      "When a fire is 100% contained, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is extinguished, but that it's controlled. \u201cA fire isn't controlled until it is fully contained, and crews have extinguished flames and smoking/smoldering fuels, and removed unburnt fuels from about 300 feet inside the fire line perimeter,\u201d the U.S. Forest Service said on its website. It could take crews several days to make sure hot spots have cooled down enough so there is little chance that flames will cross the fire boundary.",
      "A fire is considered to be out when no hot spots and smoke are detected within the lines for at least 48 hours, the Forest Service said. However, large wildfires are often watched and patrolled until rain or snow eliminates all smoke.",
      "Many wildfires burn for weeks or even months.",
      "If fire danger is imminent, authorities will issue orders to evacuate immediately. But officials can't force people to leave. Often, law enforcement will go door-to-door to let residents know that their lives are in peril.",
      "Evacuation warnings are issued to let residents know that danger is mounting and they should be prepared to flee at a moment's notice.",
      "When deciding to order people to leave, emergency managers consider a fire's behavior, the weather forecast and the amount of time it will take to flee, Russ Lane, fire operations chief for the Washington state Department of Natural Resources, told The Associated Press in 2021.",
      "They also consider the availability of shelters and the potential for harm or the loss of human life.",
      "Occasionally, an order is given to shelter in place. This is typically done when there is either no time to escape an approaching fire or it would be more hazardous to evacuate than to remain in place, Lane said.",
      "Crews stay on the scene for days and even weeks cleaning up an area that has burned. They cut down teetering trees, remove brush and other possible fuel that could reignite, clear roads, and generally make the scene as safe as possible."

      "A group of monkeys remains outside the fence close to traps set up by the company in the woods around the compound. They can be heard cooing by the Alpha Genesis employees monitoring them, police said.",
      "In all, 32 monkeys have been returned to the compound since their escape on Nov. 6 after an employee didn't fully lock an enclosure.",
      "Alpha Genesis has said that efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",

    "summary": "It can be hard to find good advice on how to make homes more energy efficient.",
    "story": [
      "When Simon Duffy gets another energy bill, his heart sinks. \u201cIt\u2019s madly expensive,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "summary": "A court throws out a ruling that the gas and oil giant cut its greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Oil giant Shell has won a landmark case in the Dutch courts, overturning an earlier ruling requiring it to cut its carbon emissions by 45%.",
      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",
      "The ruling came as climate talks involving some 200 countries got under way in Azerbaijan.",
      "Shell said it was pleased with the court's decision, but Friends of the Earth Netherlands said the ruling was a setback that affected them deeply.",
      "The environmental group can now take its case against Shell to the Supreme Court - but a final verdict could be years away.",
      "Donald Pols from the group said \"it's a marathon, not a sprint and the race isn't yet over\".",
      "At the time, the 2021 ruling marked the first time a court had ordered a private company to align its workings with the Paris climate agreement, meaning that it was not sufficient for a company simply to comply with the law - it had to comply with global climate policy too.",
      "Under the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The appeals court judge said that companies such as Shell were obliged to contribute to combating climate change based on the human right to protection against dangerous climate change.",
      "However, the court said Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and the court could not establish whether it should make a 45% cut or another percentage, as there was no current accepted agreement in climate science on the required amount.",
      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",
      "Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.",
      "The oil firm says its aim is to reduce the carbon intensity of products it sells by 15-20% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. Shell also aims to become a \"net zero\" emissions company by 2050.",
      "Part of the historic legal case hinged on the interpretation of an \"unwritten duty of care\" that exists under Dutch law, which requires companies to prevent hazardous negligence.",
      "Friends of the Earth Netherlands argued that there was an international consensus that human rights offered protection against dangerous climate change and that companies had to respect human rights.",
      "Shell's successful appeal could have far-reaching implications for corporate climate responsibility.",

    "story": [
      "A legal challenge over the decision to give consent to the UK\u2019s largest untapped oil field is taking place in Edinburgh.",
      "A judicial review brought jointly by the environment groups Greenpeace and Uplift is being heard at the Court of Session.",
      "The campaigners want to stop the development of Rosebank oil field, which is off Shetland, and the Jackdaw gas field, off Aberdeen. But oil companies say the projects are vital.",
      "If the challenge is successful, operators would have to resubmit environmental impact assessments for approval before drilling can begin.",
      "Campaigners calling for the projects to be halted held a protest outside the court on Tuesday morning.",
      "What is the judicial review about?",
      "Consent for drilling in the Rosebank field was granted by the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), in September last year.",
      "Shell\u2019s proposals to develop the Jackdaw field were approved by the NSTA in 2022, after initially being rejected on environmental grounds.",
      "The environment groups say that when consent was granted for the fields, the impact of emissions caused by burning extracted oil and gas was \u201cunlawfully ignored\u201d by regulators.",
      "Uplift accused regulators of \"failing to be transparent\" in granting the consents and said Rosebank would damage marine life in the North Sea.",
      "The UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.",
      "It effectively accepted the original decisions were unlawful.",
      "This came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that regulators must consider the total environmental impact of new projects - including the way fossil fuels are used by end consumers.",
      "It is understood that the oil companies will accept that the decisions to give the go-ahead for Rosebank and Jackdaw were unlawful because the emissions they would create were not properly assessed.",
      "They are expected to focus instead on how to move forward with the projects, given that work is already under way.",
      "What do the campaigners say?",
      "Ruth Crawford KC, who is acting for Greenpeace during the case, told the court that the greenhouse gas emissions from Rosebank and Jackdaw would be \u201csizeable and significant\u201d and would have a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on the environment and human health.",
      "She said the UK government had admitted that it was an \u201cerror of law\u201d to have failed to have taken into account greenhouse gas emissions from the eventual burning of oil and gas extracted from Rosebank and Jackdaw (known as Scope 3 emissions).",
      "Ms Crawford said granting a licence was ultimately a political decision but it must be done only after a lawful consenting process which included an environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions.",
      "She said politicians must not simply consider short-term issues when considering oil and gas projects but also the long-term effect on the climate.",
      "In this case, she argued, they failed to do so (because information about Scope 3 emissions was not available).",
      "To allow these two fields to proceed without a new environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions \u201cwould be to completely ignore that a crucial part of the decision making has not happened and will never happen.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace, she said, was not asking for oil rigs and drilling equipment to be removed. It was only asking that the oil and gas companies involved \u201cdo no further work to get petroleum from the fields.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work must stop. No more. No less,\u201d she concluded.",
      "Alastair Duncan KC, for Uplift, echoed or endorsed many of the submissions made on behalf of Greenpeace.",
      "He also addressed written submissions made on behalf of oil and gas companies, whose lawyers are expected to address the court later this week.",
      "These, he said, amounted to the companies arguing that they were \u201can innocent third party\u201d who had reasonably relied on what appeared to be a \u201cstable legal landscape\u201d when making multi-million pound investment decisions.",
      "On the contrary, argued Mr Duncan, the legal landscape had been far from stable and Rosebank\u2019s developers Equinor and Ithaca were now \u201cthe beneficiaries of an unlawful decision,\u201d who wanted the court \u201cto allow them to continue to be the beneficiaries of an unlawful decision.\u201d",
      "Mr Duncan went on to outline another objection to the granting of consent for Rosebank.",
      "He argued that, in approving the field, the Oil and Gas Authority (now known as the North Sea Transition Authority) had unlawfully and irrationally failed to give reasons for its decision.",
      "Uplift has a third objection to the decision, claiming that the previous government and the regulator failed to adequately assess the marine impacts of Rosebank.",
      "What do the oil companies say?",
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy jointly own the Rosebank field.",
      "They have said it would create about 1,600 jobs during its construction and support about 450 UK-based jobs during its lifetime.",
      "Equinor declined to comment while the court challenge was ongoing, but said it was continuing to \"work closely with all relevant parties to progress the project\".",
      "It added: \"It is vital for the UK and will bring benefits in terms of local investment, jobs and energy security.\"",
      "A Shell spokesman said the Jackdaw development had been developed in line with all relevant consents and permits.",
      "He added: \"Jackdaw is a vital project for UK energy security and the project is already well advanced.",
      "\"Stopping the work is a highly complex process, with significant technical and operational issues now that infrastructure is in place and drilling has started in the North Sea.",
      "\"Jackdaw will provide enough fuel to heat 1.4m UK homes as older gas fields reach the end of production.\"",
      "The UK government has previously pledged that oil and gas would play an important role in the economy \"for decades to come\" as the UK transitions to clean energy.",

      "Paul Patterson told the inquiry into the scandal there \"have been bugs errors and defects\" in the accountancy system and it is clear \"that there is a level of unreliability\".",

      "Mr Patterson said Fujitsu was committed to paying out compensation to the victims of the scandal, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d, but said the firm was waiting until the end of the inquiry before actually doing so.",
      "In a heated exchange with Sam Stein KC, who represented some of the victims, Mr Patterson was pushed on why this was.",
      "\u201cYou already accept that there is a need for Fujitsu to put its money where its mouth is,\u201d said Mr Stein.",

      "The government needed to be \"seen to be doing the right thing\", said Badenoch.",
      "She accepted at the inquiry into the scandal that it was \"extremely disappointing\" that it took the ITV drama to escalate the issue.",
      "But she said her row with the Treasury over the time it was taking to issue compensation last August was not just a case of her \"posturing\".",
      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",
      "He said this could be seen as \"soft power\" or \"posturing\".",

      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car.\"",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he added.",
      "\"And for companies to be able to be allowed to charge these ridiculous amounts of commission without disclosing it, without me being made aware of it at all, myself and thousands of other people.\"",

      "He was not informed that the dealership was receiving commission of \u00a31,650, which amounted to about 25% of the total he borrowed.",
      "The car finance industry is now setting aside huge amounts of money to settle similar possible claims in the future.",

      "He said claimants did not necessarily need to go via a claims management firm, which would take a cut of any payout.",
      "Mr Lewis advised people first determine whether their finance agreements included a discretionary commission arrangement and, if it did, lodge a time-stamped complaint to the company.",
      "This was echoed by Rip-Off Britain's legal expert Gary Rycroft, who told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the legal precedent set by the Court of Appeal ruling meant \"secret commission\" was deemed unlawful.",
      "He said it was important to check your contracts and ask your car finance company whether it had been disclosed if unsure.",
      "He said non-disclosure made for a clearer case but arrangements \"buried in the small print\" could still be worth making a claim against.",

      "Mr Johnson sold his Suzuki Swift in 2020, but after three years of regular payments, he still owed \u00a33,500 which he assumed then was due to the interest on the loan for the car.",
      "\u201cWith paying off the agreement for three years, I had only scratched the surface,\" he said.",
      "Dealerships were not acting outside of the rules and regulations of the industry by taking this sort of commission at that time, but they had a duty to inform their clients.",
      "The court of appeal said \u201cburying such a statement in the small print which the lender knows the borrower is highly unlikely to read will not suffice\u201d.",
      "There have been changes in the rules governing commission since 2021, when the Financial Conduct Authority banned discretionary commission arrangements.",
      "Kevin Durkin, from HD Law, who represented Mr Johnson in the test case, said: \u201cAs a financial reward for them being chosen, FirstRand Bank paid Trade Centre Wales a commission which Marcus knew nothing about.",
      "\"There was only a vague reference to this arrangement in the paperwork which the court of appeal found was buried.",
      "\"As such it meant that Marcus paid more than he necessarily needed to.\u201d",

      "He said he hoped others would also get money back, adding: \u201cI\u2019m so happy that my case and the decision that was made could potentially help thousands of other families, to me that\u2019s worth more than the money that I reclaimed in a way.\"",

    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",

      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "Wessex Water has been fined \u00a3500,000 for polluting two rivers and killing thousands of fish.",
      "The company admitted a series of failures which led to untreated sewage being discharged into the rivers in Wiltshire and North Somerset in 2018.",
      "Janine Maclean, from the Environment Agency, said: \u201cThese cases are further examples of a water company breaking the law and causing serious pollution.\"",
      "It is the second-highest fine in the company's history. A Wessex Water spokesperson apologised and said the incidents \u201cshouldn't have happened\".",
      "Clackers Brook is a small river in Wiltshire. It rises near Bromham and runs just five miles into Melksham, where it joins the River Avon.",
      "But in that first five miles, it passes the Wessex Water sewage pumping station at Bowerhill Lodge.",
      "In April 2018 the company allowed storm water with untreated sewage to flow into the river for 54 hours.",
      "Later the same year, there was a mechanical and electrical failure which led to more sewage flowing into Clackers Brook.",
      "The Environment Agency found that 2,100 fish died, including eels and lampreys  both endangered and protected species.",
      "Investigators reported that all fish within 1km of the spill were killed.",
      "Senior officer Janine Maclean said it was \"very sad the pollutions had such serious impacts - killing fish and other aquatic life\".",
      "The agency took Wessex Water to court for breaching their licence, and the company admitted the offences.",
      "Company was 'negligent'",
      "Meanwhile in North Somerset, near Weston-super-Mare, another sewage pipe burst in August 2018. Again, untreated effluent polluted the rivers and the local marsh rhyne drainage system.",

      "The sewage pipe in question was a so-called \"rising main\", a pipe through which sewage is pumped under pressure.",
      "The rising main had already been identified by Wessex Water prior to the incident, as a critical one that needed to be monitored, but the monitoring was not put in place until after the incident.",
      "District Judge Joanna Dickens, sitting at Swindon Magistrates Court, ruled the company was negligent, because \"of the failure to install monitoring equipment at an earlier time\".",
      "The Environment Agency said that Wessex Water's rising mains are \"ageing\" and account for many of the company's pollution incidents.",
      "Janine Maclean, of the Environment Agency, said: \"We recognise the company is increasing its monitoring of rising mains, but monitoring is still reliant on failure, and we would like to see the company significantly increase the level of investment it makes to proactively replace rising mains before they fail.\"",

      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",

      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",

      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",

      "This fall could happen if the President-elect went through with his repeated campaign promise to levy a 20% tax on all imports, and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.",

      "Forecasters have been expecting borrowing costs to fall further in the months ahead but warned that Trump's plans for tax cuts, immigration and tariffs could keep pressure on inflation and drive up government borrowing, complicating those bets.",
      "Trump has pledged to impose import duties of at least 10% on all goods coming into the country, costs that economists say would be passed onto consumers, helping to drive up prices.",
      "Tax cuts could also stoke inflation by encouraging spending, while the mass deportations of immigrants proposed by Trump would create a big hole in the US workforce that could drive up wages.",
      "Interest rates on US debt have already jumped this week, reflecting those concerns.",

      "\"It's such an early stage - we don't know what the policies are, we don't know when they will be implemented,\" he said. \"In the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions.\"",

      "Those rises affected the public in the form of higher borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans, helping to fuel discontent about higher living costs, especially for housing, that played a role in the election.",
      "The Fed started to reverse course in September, slashing rates by a bigger-than-usual 0.5 percentage points, saying it was confident that the pace of price rises in the US was stabilising.",
      "Inflation in the US stood at 2.4% in September, down from more than 9% in June 2022, according to the latest official figures.",

      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma.",
      "\"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\"",
      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",
      "\"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\""

    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "In general, research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency suggests most graduates can expect to earn more than non-graduates.",
      "Moreover, the Save the Student money advice website said the latest rise in tuition fees would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",
      "But borrowing more will, inevitably, mean students leave university with more debt.",
      "The government's latest announcement also only stipulates fees and loans in the 2025-26 academic year. Vice-chancellors and students alike will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",

      "Charlotte Gill is one such former student who was eligible for a refund on her loan payments, to the tune of \u00a368.",
      "She said it did not make a huge difference \"but every little helps when you are a student\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's your money, it\u2019s not the government's money, so if you've got any entitlement to a refund then absolutely take it,\" she said.",
      "Martin De'Ath received \u00a3396 in his refund and says the substantial payment made him question how he could have used it in the 10 months he was without it.",
      "\"I was definitely pleased to get it back at least,\" he said.",
      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",
      "The main reason, behind \u00a3146m of the total, is that repayments were taken from people despite them not earning above the annual threshold at which point repayments automatically kick in.",
      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",

      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",

      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",

    "story": [
      "British author Samantha Harvey has won the 2024 Booker Prize award with her novel Orbital, the first book set in space to win the prize.",
      "Orbital contemplates the world from a different viewpoint as it follows a team of astronauts in the International Space Station.",
      "It's the biggest-selling book on the shortlist in the UK, and has also outsold the past three Booker winners combined, up to the eve of their success.",
      "Harvey, the first woman to win the award since 2019,  was announced as winner at a ceremony in London's Old Billingsgate, and will take home \u00a350,000.",
      "She dedicated the prize to \"all the people who speak for and not against the earth and work for and not against peace\".",
      "She said she questioned herself while writing the book: \"Why would anybody want to hear from a woman at her desk in Wiltshire writing about space when people have actually been there?\"",
      "\"I lost my nerve with it and I thought I didn't have the authority to write it.\"",
      "Speaking to BBC News, Harvey said she was \"in complete shock and very overwhelmed\". She added that the award would change her life.",
      "Asked how she would spend the \u00a350,000 prize money, she said: \"I need to buy myself a new bike, and it's going to be a good bike.\"",
      "'Beauty and ambition'",
      "Chair of the judges, Edmund de Waal, described Orbital as a \"book about a wounded world\".",
      "He said the judges all recognised its \"beauty and ambition\" and praised her \"language of lyricism\".",
      "Writing it, Harvey said she \"thought of it as a space pastoral - a kind of nature writing about the beauty of space\".",
      "The 136-page long story, which is Harvey's fifth novel, takes place over a single day in the life of six astronauts and cosmonauts.",
      "During those 24 hours they observe 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over their silent blue planet, spinning past continents and cycling past seasons, taking in glaciers and deserts, the peaks of mountains and the swells of oceans.",
      "It is the second-shortest book to win the prize, and covers the briefest timeframe of any book on the shortlist. The shortest winning novel in the history of the prize was 1979's Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald, at 132 pages.",
      "Harvey previously told BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme she wrote Orbital over the course of successive lockdowns.",
      "\"I was writing about six people trapped in a tin can. It felt like there was something resonant about that and our experience of lockdown, of not being able to escape each other and also not being able to get to other people.\"",
      "Harvey previously made the longlist for the Booker Prize in 2009 with her debut novel, The Wilderness.",

    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker, who will leave Match of the Day at the end of this season, BBC News understands, has been the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As host of the flagship show for 25 years, he is also one of the corporation's highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million last year.",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft and presenting skills.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",
      "Clearly it did.",
      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",
      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",
      "Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told the BBC's Media Show's Ros Atkins in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\", he said.",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker presenting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June this year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March last year, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "BBC director general Tim Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The headlines and dramas generated by his online views reinforced not only his high celebrity status - but also how keen the BBC was to hang on to him.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February this year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "Despite this, he and the BBC are still parting company, and its flagship football show no longer has a host.",
      "Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at this year's Podcast Awards.",
      "But for the BBC, Lineker's departure comes hot on the heels of several scandals.",
      "Former Match of the Day and The One Show host Jermaine Jenas was sacked in August following complaints about workplace conduct.",
      "In September, the BBC apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, while clearing him of the most serious allegations.",
      "In the same month, Mr Davie said he could not see disgraced ex-news presenter Huw Edwards working at the corporation again.",
      "Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children.",
      "So the BBC is in need of some good headlines - and Lineker's departure means it now has to find an exceptional host to fill his shoes, which will not be an easy task.",

      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",

      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",

      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",

      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",

      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",

      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",

      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",

      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",

      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",

      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "summary": "I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - but never imagined the name would be hurled at me by strangers in my 30s.",
    "story": [
      "I can feel the anger rising. How am I facing this abuse again after 20 years?",
      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",
      "A disabled character from dark-humoured satire cartoon series South Park, he uses a wheelchair and can only shout his name, mainly loudly and uncontrollably.",
      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",
      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",
      "But two decades later, the fact remains that on meeting Timmy, certainly at first glance, many find him outrageously offensive.",
      "Disability slurs: 'We can't keep being poked like a bear'",
      "Soap star condemns 'daily abuse and prejudice'",
      "Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me'",
      "South Park has always worked on multiple levels - offering outrageous forbidden shock value for schoolchildren while delivering crunching adult satire.",
      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",
      "It removed the videos flagged by the BBC for violating this policy. But it didn\u2019t remove the Timmy sound used on several other videos - meaning it can be used again.",
      "TikTok didn\u2019t respond to a specific question about removing offensive audio.",
      "Ciaran O\u2019Connor, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank focusing on online hate, says that sounds are a \u201cblind spot in TikTok\u2019s content moderation practices\u201d.",
      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",
      "Ross Hovey, a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan, recently posted on LinkedIn about a near-identical experience.",
      "He was heading to a Liverpool match with his 79-year-old father and care assistant when a group of young men shouted \"Timmy\" at him. When Ross challenged them with \u201cI heard you,\u201d they too tried to claim innocence.",
      "The abuse raises questions about what role platforms should take in providing context to young users.",
      "\u201cBrief, contextless clips and participatory trends are at the heart of TikTok\u2019s popularity,\u201d  says O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",
      "\u201cIt's hard not to go overboard with admiration for a nonagenarian who remains so unaffected by her fame on the one hand,\u201d wrote one, \u201cand some of the awful things life has thrown at her on the other.\u201d",
      "She held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart as queen of its longest-running radio drama, and was thought of with enormous affection by her fellow cast members.",
      "June \u201cshone through sadness without a word of complaint,\" recalled Charles Collingwood - who plays Brian Aldridge, her fictional son-in-law, \u201cand always remained immense fun\"."

    "summary": "Milena Sanchez quit The Receipts last year, one of the UK's biggest podcasts, after a co-host rift.",
    "story": [
      "Just over a year ago, Milena Sanchez suddenly left one of the UK's most successful podcasts in a split that seemed to shock everyone - even her co-hosts.",
      "For seven years, she'd built The Receipts alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye, collecting more than 100,000 weekly listeners on the way.",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Milena says quitting was a difficult decision but her mental health had deteriorated to a point where she couldn't carry on.",
      "\"It wasn't one I took lightly - even though it might have seemed like that,\" says Milena, 33.",
      "Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years.",
      "There were also rumours - denied by the podcasters - that Milena was bullied and squeezed out of the group.",
      "\"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.",
      "The Receipts, which started in 2016 and signed a lucrative exclusive deal with Spotify in 2019, has about 100,000 weekly listeners on Spotify.",
      "\"Financially, I could've shut my mouth and stayed and collected the bag,\" says Milena.",
      "\"But for me, it's not about that. It meant more to me - my mental health, my integrity and who I am as a person, and to not sell something that wasn't true.",
      "\"It's not easy, and especially when I do have a daughter that depends on me.\"",
      "Milena says her daughter, who was just one year old when The Receipts started and is now almost 10, helped her find the courage to quit.",
      "\"I really had to sit down with myself and ask, if my daughter came to me with the same predicament, what would be my response to her?\" Milena says.",
      "\"My response wouldn't be to stay somewhere just because of money. It would just be, 'choose yourself'.",
      "\"You only live once and I know it sounds so clich\u00e9d, but you can't be stuck in a space where you just don't feel happy.\"",
      "Milena says her year since quitting The Receipts has been a \"whirlwind\".",
      "She says she left London to live in the countryside and pursue music and writing, but realised she was missing podcasting.",
      "\"There's been a lot of reflecting, a lot of self-analysing,\" says Milena.",
      "\"Ultimately I had to say to myself: I love speaking, my voice is very needed.\"",
      "'A one-man band'",
      "Milena says she had to overcome a lot of self-doubt before launching her own solo podcast.",
      "\"I was scared to put this podcast out.",
      "\"I felt like I'm just going to be in my home talking. It doesn't feel big enough, it doesn't feel glitzy enough.",
      "\"But it doesn't matter where it's coming from,\" Milena says she told herself.",
      "\"You started from from the ground before, so let's go again.\"",
      "Since she launched solo project Milena's Diary at the end of September, she says she's been \"overwhelmed\" by the response.",
      "\"It reminded me, 'this is why you are here. This is your purpose'.\"",
      "But \"it was very difficult to start again from the ground up,\" she says - and definitely a change of pace from The Receipts.",
      "There, \"I had a team,\" she says.",
      "\"We had production, we had social media people, somebody that edited the podcasts.",
      "\"All I had to do was turn up and talk and that's it.",
      "\"Now doing this solo, I'm doing everything myself. I'm a one-man band.\"",
      "Previously, she was one of three presenters bouncing off each other and not having that has been a \"hard\" transition.",
      "\"I really do enjoy being on episodes with other people because you do bounce back, there's other stories that are triggered in your mind and it's nice,\" she says.",
      "\"But I feel like having that time alone to self-reflect and to just talk is also very important.\"",
      "Milena says she uses her podcast \"as therapy\" and she feels more authentically herself than ever.",
      "She's also spent the past year releasing music leaning into her Colombian heritage and queer identity.",
      "\"My culture is so ingrained in me, even though I was born in London,\" she says.",
      "\"And I'm a queer woman so I'm going to talk on that openly and very proudly.\"",
      "Looking back on the past year, \"I feel so much happier,\" Milena says.",
      "\"I am in a space where I have done so much work on myself, so much self-reflection and taking accountability for things I don't think that I would've a couple of years back.",
      "\"I'm just so grateful to myself for making the decisions I have made.\"",
      "And despite the public statements earlier this year, Milena says she only wants the best for her former co-hosts Tolani and Audrey, who continued The Receipts as a duo.",

      "Three people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction star Liam Payne, Argentine authorities have announced.",
      "Payne died on 16 October after falling from a hotel balcony in the capital, Buenos Aires.",
      "On 6 November, his body was released to his family to be flown back to the UK, having previously been held while toxicology and laboratory tests were carried out.",
      "Here's what we know so far about the police investigation and the circumstances surrounding Payne's death.",
      "Why was Liam in Argentina?",
      "Payne was visiting his former bandmate Niall Horan, who was in the country on tour.",
      "He posted on Snapchat earlier in October that he was visiting Horan for a catch-up, saying: \"It's been a while since me and Niall have spoken, we've got a lot to talk about.\" He added: \"No bad vibes or anything like that, but we need to talk.\"",

      "He documented much of his trip on Snapchat, including pictures of food, plans to play polo, and jokes about his hair.",
      "We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "A call was made to emergency services around 17:00 local time (21:00 BST) on 16 October by staff, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",
      "\"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" said the hotel's front desk manager in a second call.",

      "Payne's room was on the third floor and had a balcony about 14m (45ft) above an interior courtyard.",
      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "Prosecutors also said they had examined more than 800 hours of video footage from security cameras in the hotel and public roads; and had examined calls, messages and social media activity on Payne's phone.",
      "They also received dozens of testimonies from hotel staff, family members, friends and medical professionals. Among those interviewed were two women who had been with the singer at his hotel but left before his death.",
      "What are the charges?",
      "One person has been charged with the abandonment of a person followed by death - which has a sentence of up to 15 years in prison - and the supply and facilitation of drugs.",

      "Mr Marks was also worried about the fact that while doctors receive seven years of training, PAs receive two.",

      "The drug, which fights cravings, was available a few years ago on the NHS under the brand name Champix but was withdrawn due to some impurities. The new version has been approved as safe.",

      "It works by reducing cravings for nicotine and blocking its effect on the brain, while also helping with withdrawal symptoms, such as feeling irritable or having difficulty sleeping.",
      "When used alongside behavioural support, such as counselling, it has been shown to help around one in four people to stop smoking for at least six months, said NHS England.",
      "That could help more than 85,000 people stop smoking each year, it said, and  might prevent around 9,500 smoking-related deaths over the next five years, according to research by University College London.",
      "Around one in eight adults\u00a0 - six million people in the UK\u00a0- are smokers.",

      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The rollout of this pill can save the NHS millions of pounds, save appointments to help other patients be seen faster and save lives.\"",
      "Announcing the launch at the NHS Providers annual conference, NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the drug could be a \"game-changer\" for people who want to quit smoking.",
      "What about vapes?",
      "Since e-cigarettes are not licensed as medicines, GPs are unable to prescribe vapes to people trying to quit smoking unless there is a locally agreed NHS scheme to do so.",
      "Some local authorities do offer vapes to smokers who are looking to quit.",
      "Guidelines recommend people try a licensed stop smoking medicine first, though vapes are a recognised smoking cessation aid.",
      "Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes.",
      "However, it is not entirely risk free and health experts agree people should not start vaping other than to give up smoking.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said access to services was variable.",

      "\u201cImproving access to varenicline will be a positive step forward to help prevent the tens of thousands of deaths caused by smoking. However, a drug alone will not transform smoking rates. Services are needed to support smokers and prescribe these products.",
      "\"The NHS has done a good job in setting up in-hospital support to help people quit smoking, which complements the services provided in the community.",
      "\"But gaps remain around the country, with services often in peril as local NHS organisations try to balance the books.\"",
      "Prof Nick Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said varenicline was the \"most effective smoking cessation medication\".",
      "The fact it has not been available for the last few years has been a \"real problem\", he said, adding: \"We know that quitting smoking is the best thing anyone who smokes can do to improve their health and the health of people around them, especially children and young people.",
      "\u201cPeople are most likely to quit successfully if they have a combination of counselling support and medication to relieve cravings and help break their tobacco dependence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",

      "Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.",

      "\"Frankly, I was personally terrified that the NHS was going to be overwhelmed.\"",
      "The project was halted on 28 March 2020, after it became clear the peak of the first Covid wave was approaching and the health service would not \"breach capacity\".",
      "Sir Stephen said there was also a danger the point-scoring system could have been \"used inappropriately\", replacing the individual clinical judgement of doctors.",
      "\"My recommendation to the inquiry is that we should absolutely, in the future, not try and develop one of these tools in the midst of a pandemic,\" he added.",
      "He said it was a piece of work that needed to be carried out in consultation with the public \"in normal times\".",
      "\"In my view, it's a discussion that shouldn't be government-led, it shouldn't even be led by the profession, it needs to be located within society.\""

      "He was one of only seven G20 leaders attending the summit, with 13 absentees including the premiers of the US, China, France and Germany.",
      "Sir Keir would not be drawn on his views about president-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to cut climate rules during his election campaign.",
      "He said: \"Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game\".",
      "The target will be included in papers to go before Parliament before February and, although Sir Keir did not announce any new policies, he did commit to continuing to provide \u00a311.6bn of climate finance until March 2026, a pledge made under the previous government.",
      "Announcing a \u00a31bn investment in a wind turbine project in Hull, which he said would create 1,300 local jobs, Sir Keir said the world was standing at a \"critical juncture in the climate crisis\".",
      "The UK has called for other countries to match the new target, following stark warnings from the United Nations that the world is on course for a 3.1C rise without further cuts.",
      "The latest target is broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050, contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
      "That international agreement ties the UK to ratcheting up new \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) for carbon reduction every five years, which has seen the a 68% cut by 2030 increase to an 81% cut by 2035.",
      "The Climate Change Act 2008 also set legally-binding domestic agreements on carbon budgets in five year chunks until 2050, which unlike the NDC targets also include international aviation and shipping emissions.",
      "The latest of these is the sixth carbon budget, which runs between 2033-2037, and has already been set at 78%.",
      "Since taking power in July, Labour has ended an effective ban on new onshore wind projects and pledged not to issue any new oil and gas exploration licenses in the North Sea, as well as closing the UK's last coal power plant in September.",
      "The switch towards greener energy has already halved the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 - but the CCC has previously said further reductions will be difficult without lifestyle changes.",
      "The government advisers said taxes on meat and dairy might be needed if people do not voluntarily reduce their consumption of the products, and there should be moves to phase out the use of petrol cars.",
      "Speaking at the summit, Sir Keir said the new UK target would be \"difficult\" but \"achievable\", and he wanted government to \"tread lightly on people's lives\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not about telling people how to live their lives \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in that,\" he added.",
      "\"I am interested in making sure their energy bills are stable, that we\u2019ve got energy independence, and that we also along the way pick up the next generation of jobs.\"",
      "However, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho claimed the new target would lead to \"hardship\" for the British people.",
      "During energy questions in the Commons, Coutinho said making \"already stringent carbon emission targets even higher\" would require a \"shift away from meat and dairy\" and \"less travel\".",
      "The Conservative MP claimed the approach would \"see our reliance on Chinese imports - a country which is 60% powered by coal - go through the roof\".",
      "In response, energy minister Kerry McCarthy said: \"It's really important that we are stepping up and showing global ambition.",
      "\"Reaching net zero in this country and getting to clean power by 2030 is a massive opportunity - it is not a cost.\"",
      "The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, welcomed the new target and said it was feasible based on the latest science, technological developments, and the UK\u2019s national circumstances.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that this is a feasible target that will support jobs and investment,\" he said, adding the UK was currently running behind schedule on delivering its 2030 target of 68% cuts.",
      "He added: \"A target is only as meaningful as the delivery against it.",
      "\"The UK needs to get back on track to deliver against our existing 2030 NDC commitment.",
      "\"We need to see further urgent action to speed up deployment of low-carbon solutions such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and tree planting.\"",
      "All countries who have signed up to the Paris Agreement should submit their latest carbon reduction targets by a deadline of February next year and a copy of that memo, known as the Information to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU), will be presented to MPs before then."

      "SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn intends to stand at the 2026 Holyrood elections, he has announced.",
      "The Aberdeen South MP said if elected to the Scottish Parliament he would aim to hold his Westminster seat until the next general election, due in 2029, but would not accept two salaries.",
      "The announcement has prompted concerns among party colleagues, with one MSP urging him to rethink his decision.",
      "Applications to stand as an SNP candidate in 2026 closed on Monday, though the formal selection process will not start until next year.",
      "BBC Scotland News understands that former first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf have submitted applications, but are both yet to decide on whether to stand for re-election.",
      "Flynn, writing in the Press and Journal, said he hoped to win his party's nomination for the Aberdeen South and North Kincardine seat, currently held by Audrey Nicoll.",
      "The SNP Westminster leader told BBC Scotland News: \"As we make this journey to independence, I believe that we need our strongest voices within Holyrood all pulling in the same direction. I believe that I can contribute as part of that process.\u201d",
      "Flynn said he took \"no pleasure\" from potentially competing with Nicoll for selection.",
      "\"We are a democratic party, this does happen on occasion,\" he said. \u201cIt will now be for members to decide the outcome.\u201d",
      "The MP insisted the dual role would offer him a \u201cplatform to speak up for Scotland's interest\u201d, both at Holyrood and Westminster.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that's a good thing,\u201d he added.",

      "\"I love this role and it\u2019s very important to me. It\u2019s filled with responsibility and I look forward to continuing it if I can.\"",
      "Jobs controversy",
      "Ahead of the 2021 election, the SNP changed internal rules to require MPs to resign their seat at Westminster to fight for selection to Holyrood.",
      "The party previously criticised former Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross for holding seats at Westminster and Holyrood, as well as being a professional football referee.",
      "In 2021, SNP MSP Karen Adam claimed Ross was \u201cfailing\u201d his constituents \u201cby thinking he can do both jobs properly\u201d.",

      "SNP MSP Emma Roddick said she hoped Flynn \"rethinks\" his ambition to hold two seats seats.",
      "She posted on X: \u201cParty members set this rule for good reasons. Rightly, Douglas Ross was criticised for holding two roles simultaneously.\"",
      "The Highlands and Islands representative said she could not imagine \"being a good MSP\" while spending \"half\" her time in London.",
      "She added: \"(It is) Key that rules apply to everyone equally; men and women.\"",
      "One former SNP MP told BBC Scotland News: \"I'm not sure being seen to do Audrey Nicoll out of her job so that he can have two jobs is a smart pitch.\"",
      "Another senior party figure described Flynn's move as \"naked ambition\".",
      "Dozens of MSPs have had a dual mandate, either as a member of the House of Lords, the House of Commons or as a councillor - including 20 this term.",
      "Roddick, who was elected to Holyrood in 2021, held a dual mandate for a year while also serving as an Inverness councillor.",
      "The SNP is yet to decide what its rules will be for candidates at the next election.",
      "The change on dual mandates led to then-MP Joanna Cherry pulling out of the selection contest for the Edinburgh Central seat.",
      "Health Secretary Neil Gray also had to resign as an MP before being elected to Holyrood in 2021.",
      "Cherry - who lost her Westminster seat in July\u2019s general election and has ruled out a bid for election to Holyrood in 2026 - said the SNP rule was \u201cperson specific\u201d.",
      "Responding to Flynn\u2019s announcement, she added in a post on X that the rule \u201cserved its purpose\u201d and predicted it would not be in place for 2026.",
      "The Scottish government recently said it intended to launch a consultation on proposals to ban MSPs from holding dual mandates, though any changes are not expected to be introduced in time for the 2026 election.",
      "'Absolute hypocrisy'",
      "Conservative MSP Liam Kerr highlighted the SNP's previous opposition to dual mandates, adding: \u201cAnd now, when it suits Stephen Flynn, and it seems to suit the SNP, they decide that it\u2019s all perfectly acceptable in their world.\u201d",
      "He told BBC Scotland News: \u201cIt\u2019s absolute hypocrisy and it\u2019s appalling.\u201d",

      "Few who follow Scottish politics will be surprised by Stephen Flynn\u2019s decision.",
      "He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the SNP\u2019s most talented politicians. And Holyrood offers opportunities for him that Westminster never will (such as being a government minister or - one day perhaps - first minister).",
      "But this is a controversial move in a number of ways.",
      "Even though other SNP politicians have sat previously at Westminster and Holyrood simultaneously, party rhetoric on \"double jobbing\" has hardened in recent years.",
      "The party previously claimed former Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross was trying to \"have his cake and eat it\" by sitting in both parliaments.",
      "Flynn will now face the same accusation.",
      "Secondly, there\u2019s already a sitting SNP MSP in the seat where Stephen Flynn aims to be a candidate. And she has not indicated that she plans to stand down. So it looks like an internal challenge is on.",
      "To sum it up, this is an expected move with some unexpected elements.",
      "Former SNP MP Richard Thomson, who lost his seat in Gordon in July, has also confirmed he is seeking election to Holyrood in 2026.",
      "He has not specified a constituency, though he posted on X that there was \u201cimportant work to be done for the north east and Scotland as a whole\u201d.",

    "summary": "NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard says the decision, in July 2020, was very disappointing.",
    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

    "story": [
      "Fujitsu Europe's boss has admitted he \"does not know\" if the Post Office Horizon IT system at the heart of hundreds of sub-postmasters' wrongful convictions is reliable.",
      "Paul Patterson told the inquiry into the scandal there \"have been bugs errors and defects\" in the accountancy system and it is clear \"that there is a level of unreliability\".",
      "He agreed that this would be an issue for sub-postmasters currently using Horizon.",
      "In his second appearance in front of the inquiry, Patterson also admitted that he did not know whether Fujitsu had done an independent report into the software system.",
      "Though he added that he would welcome a third-party investigation.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.",
      "Fujitsu's Horizon contract is up for renewal early next year and could be extended for a further five years.",
      "Patterson said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen if this happens because of how unreliable Horizon is.",
      "\"In my experience... if you don\u2019t keep [IT systems] upgraded, I cannot determine what will or will not happen, which is part of my nervousness of it being extended,\" he said.",
      "Monday marked the start of the final week of evidence at the inquiry, more than two and a half years since it started hearing evidence in public.",
      "Mr Patterson said Fujitsu was committed to paying out compensation to the victims of the scandal, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d, but said the firm was waiting until the end of the inquiry before actually doing so.",
      "In a heated exchange with Sam Stein KC, who represented some of the victims, Mr Patterson was pushed on why this was.",
      "\u201cYou already accept that there is a need for Fujitsu to put its money where its mouth is,\u201d said Mr Stein.",
      "Mr Patterson said the company wanted to hear all the evidence before going ahead. \u201cThese are complex matters and we need to understand all the components,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier in the day, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch gave evidence - as the former business secretary, the government-owned Post Office came under her remit.",
      "Mr Bates v The Post Office",
      "She said that the airing of the TV drama into the Post Office scandal \"brought the urgency\" to speed up compensation pay outs for sub-postmasters.",
      "The government needed to be \"seen to be doing the right thing\", said Badenoch.",
      "She accepted at the inquiry into the scandal that it was \"extremely disappointing\" that it took the ITV drama to escalate the issue.",
      "But she said her row with the Treasury over the time it was taking to issue compensation last August was not just a case of her \"posturing\".",
      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",
      "He said this could be seen as \"soft power\" or \"posturing\".",
      "But Badenoch denied the claim, saying: \"It was signalling the direction I wanted the department to take to make it very clear.\"",
      "She said she believed speed should triumph over accuracy, and admitted that this might not have represented value for money from a taxpayer point of view.",
      "'Vanilla updates'",
      "Badenoch was also questioned over her sacking of former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton.",
      "She said she was not aware of how serious concerns were about him because of \"vanilla updates\" from civil servants.",
      "Her evidence statement provided her reasons for Staunton's dismissal, which included the former chairman attempting to shut down a whistleblowing probe into his conduct, behaving in an aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful manner, and having a poor understanding of Post Office's work.",
      "Staunton has previously defended himself after a report found he used derogatory language during a meeting about recruiting a board member. He has also refuted Badenoch's claim that he was under a \"formal investigation\" for \"serious matters such as bullying\".",
      "'Nothing should be off the table'",
      "Earlier on Monday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said ownership of the Post Office could be handed over to its thousands of sub-postmasters across the UK.",
      "\"Nothing should be off the table for the future of the Post Office,\" he said, adding that the organisation's future will be set out in the first half of next year.",

      "Treasury minister Darren Jones has said the UK government's commitment to Ukraine is \"resolute\" amid fears incoming US President Donald Trump could push the country into giving up territory to Russia.",
      "Jones told BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, \"Ukraine should be able to recover its country as it was previously structured\" and that there \"shouldn't be an element of conceding to illegal invasions from Russia\".",
      "He added he would not comment on \"hypothetical scenarios\" of a future US administration.",
      "Speaking to the same programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the UK had to find a \"shared way of working with the US\" on Ukraine.",
      "During the election campaign, Trump characterised the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a drain on US resources and said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \"in a day\".",
      "The president-elect has not offered details of how he would resolve the conflict,",
      "However, a research paper written by two of his former national security advisers has argued that the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia.",
      "To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s entry into Nato, the military alliance of European and North American nations.",
      "The former advisers argued Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines.",
      "Return of unpredictable president puts UK defence spending top of agenda",
      "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China",
      "Russia suffers worst month for casualties, says UK defence chief",
      "Asked how the UK government would respond if Trump did compel Ukraine to make territorial concessions, Jones said: \"Our commitment to Ukraine as a country here in the UK is resolute.",
      "\"We continue to support Ukraine with billions of pounds of funding every year and support from our armed forces in line with our commitments through Nato.\"",
      "Asked if the UK still respected Ukraine's desire to get back territories such as Crimea, Jones said: \"That is the basis on which the UK is operating.\"",
      "Dame Priti, who was appointed shadow foreign secretary earlier this week, agreed Ukraine should not have to concede Crimea.",
      "\u201cNo, of course not,\" she said adding: \"We\u2019ve been unequivocal as Conservatives in government\u2026 we stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine.\"",
      "She added that Trump \u201chasn\u2019t entered the White House yet\u201d and it would be wrong to speculate on future US foreign policy.",
      "\"I think, take one step back, let\u2019s be mature about this.",
      "\"We need to have dialogue and this comes back to having a strong relationship with our closest ally.",
      "\"I would urge our government going forward to be constructive in those discussions.\"",
      "Speaking to the same programme, Chief of the UK Defence Staff Sir Tony Radakin said Russia had suffered its worst ever month for casualties since the start of the Ukraine war, with around 1,500 dying or wounded every single day.",
      "Sir Tony said the losses were \"for tiny increments of land\" but that there was \"no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine\".",
      "\"Russia is spending over 40% of its public expenditure now on defence and security - that is an enormous drain on Russia as a country.",
      "\"I\u2019m saying the longer the war goes on, the more difficult it is.\"",
      "He reiterated the UK government's stance that Western allies would be resolute for \"as long as it takes\" adding: \"That\u2019s the message President Putin has to absorb and the reassurance for President Zelensky.\"",
      "Former Labour minister Lord Peter Mandelson said: \"Whatever happens to the fringes of Ukraine territory - and in that I don\u2019t think anyone should be dictating to the Ukrainians what they do - what is sacrosanct is their freedom. That\u2019s not up for grabs.\"",
      "He said the UK should work with the US to secure Ukraine's freedom and its borders to ensure Russia \"can't invade again\".",
      "He added that would be possible, not by offering Ukraine Nato membership, but by building \"stronger, deeper\" economic relationships with the country.",
      "There have been reports that Lord Mandelson could be appointed the UK's new ambassador to the United States.",
      "Asked if he was in the frame for the high-profile position, he said: \"Nobody has spoken to me about this job.\"",
      "On whether he would be interested, he said he would be \"very interested indeed in giving advice about trade to whoever is appointed\".",
      "In addition to criticising the amount the US is spending to support Ukraine, Trump has also repeatedly urged Nato members to spend more on their own defence, accusing European countries of free-riding on America.",
      "Nato countries are expected to spend 2% of their national income on defence. At the moment 23 countries - including the UK - meet the target, compared to just six in 2021.",
      "The Labour government has committed to increasing spending from 2.3% to 2.5% - but has not set a date for hitting the figure.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 15:45:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Hospitality bosses are calling for changes to what they describe as \"unsustainable\" tax rises.",
    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",
      "Amid criticism from the hospitality sector, Rachel Reeves is expected to unveil pension reforms this week which are intended to channel money into private businesses and infrastructure.",

      "In 2019, ahead of Trump's state visit to the UK, Lammy also posted that the then-president was \"deluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic\" and \"no friend of Britain\".",
      "Pressed over whether he had changed his mind, Lammy said the remarks were \"old news\" and you would \"struggle to find any politician\" who had not said some \"pretty ripe things\" about Trump in the past.",
      "\"In that period, particularly with people on Twitter, lots of things were said about Donald Trump,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that what you say as a backbencher and what you do wearing the real duty of public office are two different things.",
      "\"And I am foreign secretary. There are things I know now that I didn't know back then.\"",
      "Asked in if Trump brought up his previous comments when the pair met for dinner in New York in September, Lammy said: \"Not even vaguely.\"",
      "\"I know this is a talking point today, but in a world where there's war in Europe, where there's a tremendous loss of life in the Middle East, where the US and the UK genuinely have a special relationship, where we got someone who's about to become again, the US president, who has experience of doing the job last time round, we will forge common interests,\" he said.",
      "\"We will agree and align on much and where we disagree, we'll have those conversations as well, most often in private.\"",

      "He described Trump as \u201cwarm about the UK,\u201d especially toward the Royal Family, and noted he \u201cloves Scotland\u201d.",
      "But during the election campaign, he vowed to dramatically increase taxes, or tariffs, on foreign goods imported into the US.",
      "Such a move could hit billions of pounds' worth of British exports, including Scotch whisky, pharmaceutical products, and airplane parts.",
      "Asked if the UK would seek a special trade arrangement so there were no extra tariffs on British exports to the US, Lammy said: \"We will seek to ensure and to get across to the United States, and I believe that they would understand this, that hurting your closest allies cannot be in your medium or long-term interests.\"",
      "Lammy also said Trump was \"correct\" in his argument that Europe had fallen short on defence spending.",
      "He called for a \u201cclear\u201d pledge from European governments to boosting military spending but could not say when the government would reach its target of spending 2.5% GDP on defence.",
      "Lammy argued another state visit for Trump next year would be a \"tall order\" as they \"take a while to organise\".",
      "State visits are the highest level of diplomatic visit to the UK and traditionally involve a state banquet hosted by the monarch and a carriage parade along the Mall.",
      "But Lammy said the government \"generally want to be generous with our American friends\".",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage, who spent US election night in Florida as Trump\u2019s guest, said it would have been \"impossible\" for Lammy to \"carry on\" as foreign secretary if he had stuck by his previous comments.",
      "But he warned that the \u201cproblems\u201d in Lammy\u2019s relationship with Trump would come from other issues, such as \u201cgiving away the Chagos Islands, where there's a very important US naval base\u201d.",

      "Some surveys suggest the leader himself might not be as popular in Wales as he might like, but Reform is polling at around 14-17 seats .",
      "That would represent a big block in the new expanded 96-seat Senedd.",

      "In a previous mandate, McMonagle was employed jointly by former Sinn F\u00e9in MLAs Daithi McKay and Mitchel McLaughlin in a full-time position from 6 May 2014 to 31 October 2014.",
      "He also worked as press officer for the party in the north west and at Westminster.",

      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to government data.",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",

      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",

      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",

    "story": [
      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",
      "\"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",

      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",

      "With world leaders meeting next week for the latest UN climate talks, COP29, the Trump victory will be seen as a huge roadblock to progress in both cutting emissions and raising cash for developing countries.",
      "The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a \"scam\".",
      "But with renewable energy gaining a strong foothold in the US and popular support for wind and solar, Trump's efforts to ramp up oil and gas instead may be less effective.",

      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

      "This was ratified by the US Senate, almost unanimously, in 1992. Legal experts are unclear on the process of leaving the treaty, but any effort by the US to leave would be seen as a body blow to the principle of multi-lateral action to tackle the world's greatest threat.",
      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",
      "\"You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy,\" Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News.",
      "\"You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers.\"",
      "There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.",
      "But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for  coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.",
      "For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.",
      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",
      "According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.",
      "With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.",
      "Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration.",
      "\"The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action,\" said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

    "story": [
      "NatWest Group has blocked messaging services WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype on company devices in the UK to stop staff using them to communicate with each other.",
      "The bank had already told employees to stick to \"approved channels\" for conversations about business matters.",
      "But now it has gone further and made the platforms inaccessible on work phones and computers.",
      "So-called off-channel communications are a persistent problem in both business and politics, with concerns that services such as WhatsApp are used to reduce the scrutiny some conversations can be subject to.",
      "Messages can be difficult to retrieve or even set to disappear - whereas those sent via approved channels are fully retrievable, meaning they can be looked into if there is any suspected wrongdoing.",

    "summary": "Its record price is making headlines - but that's just one part of the cryptocurrency's tumultuous story.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs.",
      "Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.",
      "Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.",
      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "story": [
      "At least 35 people have been killed in a car attack in southern China, believed to be the deadliest known act of public violence in the country in decades.",
      "Police say a man crashed his car into a stadium in Zhuhai on Monday where he ran down groups of people exercising on the sports track.",
      "The \"serious and vicious attack\" also injured 45 people - among them elderly and children, local media report.",
      "Police say the 62-year-old driver, identified as a Mr Fan, appeared to have acted out of unhappiness over a divorce settlement.",
      "He was arrested as he tried to flee the Zhuhai Sports Center and is in a coma due to self-inflicted wounds, police said in a statement.",
      "The incident has sparked a national outcry in China, where President Xi Jinping vowed \"severe punishment\" for the perpetrator, and called for \"all-out efforts\" to treat the injured.",
      "When horror hits China, the first instinct is shut it down",
      "Details of those who were killed have not been disclosed by authorities yet, but mourners and members of the public had begun laying flowers and other tributes outside the stadium on Tuesday.",
      "The venue - featuring a running track loop - had been a popular exercise ground for locals. Witnesses told Chinese media it appeared Mr Fan had deliberately run people down.",
      "One man named Mr Chen told Caixin news magazine he and his walking group had just completed a lap of the stadium when a car charged towards them at high speed, \"knocking down many people\".",
      "Another person at the scene told Caixin: \"It drove in a loop and people were hurt in all areas of the running track.\"",
      "According to local police, who released a statement on Tuesday, they said their initial investigations suggested Mr Fan's actions were triggered by a property dispute following his divorce. He is still in a coma and so has not been questioned, police said.",
      "The attack may be the deadliest act of random public violence in China in recent decades. A number have been reported this year including a mass stabbing and firearms attack in Shandong in February which killed at least 21 people. That incident was heavily censored by Chinese authorities.",
      "Reports of Monday's attack were already being restricted online on Tuesday - with several videos taken by witnesses at the scene removed from Chinese social media platforms.",
      "But some footage still circulating online showed dozens of people lying on the ground and being attended to by paramedics and bystanders.",
      "In China it is common for censors to quickly take down social media videos which are linked to high-profile incidences of crime.",
      "BBC journalists reporting from the stadium at Zhuhai on Tuesday were also harassed and told to stop filming.",
      "China has seen a spate of violent attacks on members of the public in recent months that have been reported in local media to varying degrees.",
      "In October, a knife attack at a top school in Beijing injured five people, while in September, a man went on a stabbing spree at a supermarket in Shanghai, killing three people and injuring several others.",
      "Also in September, a 10-year-old Japanese student died a day after he was stabbed near his school in southern China.",
      "Following Monday's car attack, Japan's embassy warned its nationals living in the country to avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public.",
      "The incident in Zhuhai has also taken place during heightened security in the city, which is hosting a major military airshow this week. The attack on Monday night took place 40km (24 miles) from where the high-profile Airshow China kicked off on Tuesday.",
      "China is showcasing its newest warplanes and attack drones at the show, which top Russian defence official and former defence minister Sergei Shoigu is expected to attend.",
      "Several entrances and exits to the sports centre were closed during the airshow to facilitate \"control\", the centre's management said on Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "Fixing LED strip lights to the bottom of surfboards could deter attacks by great white sharks, Australian scientists say.",
      "A study conducted in Mossel Bay, South Africa involved towing seal-shaped boards fitted with different configurations of lights behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "The researchers from Macquarie University in New South Wales say the lights distorted the silhouette of their \"decoys\" on the ocean's surface and limited the ability of the great whites to see against the sunlight.",
      "Lights could prove a non-invasive means of shark restraint, unlike nets or drones, they added.",
      "Great white sharks are the species responsible for most human shark-bite fatalities, and often attack their prey from underneath, lead researcher Laura Ryan said. This means that sometimes the sharks mistake a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Researchers say it is also important to see whether the LED lighting is effective in deterring other shark species known to attack humans, including bull sharks and tiger sharks.",
      "Most attacks are associated with people surfing and participating in other board sports. There were 69 unprovoked shark bites in 2023, most in the US, Australia and South Africa, 10 of which were fatal, according to statistics.",
      "The Australian study, published in the journal Current Biology, involved testing three different intensities of LED lights.",
      "Ms Ryan said the study showed the brightest horizontal-aligned lights were less likely to be targeted.",
      "The researchers said: \"Our results reveal the importance of a dark silhouette against a lighter background in predatory behaviour in great white sharks and that altering the silhouette may form the basis of new non-invasive shark deterrent technology to protect human life.\"",
      "They added it was interesting that great white sharks were less attracted to the most conspicuous lights because other studies have found some species were drawn to bright, reflective objects.",
      "The researchers are now building prototype lighting strips to test on surfboards and kayaks.",

      "Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an \u201caggrieved racial minority\u201d. \u201cBut that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cI hate that if you\u2019re black, you've got to be a Democrat or you hate black people and you hate your community,\u201d Kenard Holmes, a 20-year-old student in South Carolina, told the BBC during the presidential primaries earlier this year. He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.",
      "With some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short.",
      "In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008.",
      "Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris.",
      "His economic message cut across racial divides.",
      "\u201cWe're just sick of hearing about identity politics,\" said Nicole Williams, a white bartender with a black husband and biracial children in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 one of the key battleground states that Trump flipped this year.",
      "\u201cWe're just American, and we just want what's best for Americans,\" she said.",
      "The Democratic blame game begins",
      "Democrats are already engaged in considerable soul-searching, as they come to grips with an election defeat that has delivered the White House, the Senate and, perhaps, the House of Representatives to Republican control.",
      "Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power.",
      "Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters.",
      "Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.",
      "Pelosi blames Biden for election loss as finger pointing intensifies",
      "Who's in the frame to join Trump's new top team?",
      "Among the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans.",
      "Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history.",
      "Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.",
      "In the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus.",
      "One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion.",
      "After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d",
      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",
      "Future elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign.",
      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.\u201d",
      "Moses Santana, a Puerto Rican living in Philadelphia, is from a demographic which seemed reliably Democratic a decade or so ago. But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him.",
      "\u201cYou know, Joe Biden promised a lot of progressive things, like he was going to cancel student debt, he was going to help people get their citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of that happened. Donald Trump is bringing [people] something new.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe will safeguard the heart of the republic \u2013 freedom,\u201d she vowed, and urged Americans to rise above ideology for the sake of the country.",
      "It was a brief message, but suggested a shift in how the former first lady will approach the role this second time around.",
      "When Trump won his first presidency in 2016, his wife was initially absent from the White House, instead staying in New York with their young son. She appeared reticent, at times, with the traditions set out by first ladies that preceded her.",
      "But experts say that this time, Mrs Trump will likely be more deliberate with her approach to the largely undefined role of being America\u2019s First Lady.",
      "Born Melanija Knavs, the 54-year-old Slovenian-American former fashion model eventually traded a glamorous life in the gilded walls of Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower for the confines of political life that came with the Oval Office, during a presidency that was often mired in controversy.",
      "Described by some as an \u201cenigma\u201d, Mrs Trump has preferred to be less public than her predecessors, giving fewer speeches both in the White House and on the campaign trail.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been unique among modern first ladies,\u201d said Tammy Vigil, an associate professor of communications at Boston University and author of a book on Michelle Obama and Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cShe does things the way she wants to do them, as opposed to the way she has to do them. But she fulfils the base expectations.\u201d",
      "In recent years, she avoided the spotlight as her husband challenged several legal cases against him while he campaigned for a second term.",
      "Her absence inspired several news articles this summer asking: \u201cWhere is Melania?\u201d",
      "Mrs Trump did appear on key occasions, like when her husband announced in late 2022 that he would be running again.",
      "She also attended the Republican National Convention in July wearing a bright red Christian Dior suit, but did not deliver a speech - another break from tradition.",
      "When she does speak, her words appear carefully chosen, offering hints to her point of view.",
      "At her husband\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally just weeks before Election Day, she delivered short but pointed remarks in line with the Trump campaign's law and order messaging, painting New York City as a \u201cgreat metropolis\u201d in decline due to rampant crime.",
      "She also spoke after the first assassination attempt on her husband, calling for unity and labelling the perpetrator a \u201cmonster\u201d.",
      "In a rare interview on Fox, she later accused his political opponents and the media of \u201cfuelling a toxic atmosphere\u201d that led to the attack.",

      "Mrs Kennedy was a fashion icon who was dedicated to the preservation of the White House, while Mrs Ford was known as a trailblazer who advocated for abortion rights and women's rights.",
      "After relocating to Washington, Mrs Trump started taking on first lady duties, such as hosting luncheons and state dinners for visiting world leaders. She also focused on White House aesthetics, ordering extensive renovations and overseeing ambitious Christmas decorations (and was once secretly recorded complaining about that last task).",
      "Her clothing was the subject of media fascination and controversy, particularly after she was spotted wearing a jacket with the phrase \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do you?\u201d during a trip to a migrant child detention centre in 2018.",
      "She said the jacket was a message for \u201cthe people and the left-wing media\u201d who were criticising her.",
      "Mrs Trump came under fire again after being secretly recorded by her former friend and senior advisor. She was heard expressing her frustration at being criticised for her husband\u2019s policy to separate migrant children from their families.",
      "She later revealed that she had been blindsided by the policy, and had told Trump privately that she did not support it. The policy was dropped by the president in June 2018 after a firestorm of controversy.",
      "Prof Vigil says one of the biggest challenges that Mrs Trump faced in her first term was her political inexperience as well as a revolving door of staff, who were equally inexperienced and at times disloyal.",
      "But Mrs Trump kept quietly busy regardless, Prof Vigil adds, advocating for issues like children\u2019s welfare through her Be Best campaign against online bullying.",
      "She was forced to defend that campaign given her own husband's aggressive use of social media, telling CBS in 2016 that how he conducted himself online got him in trouble - and boosted his followers.",
      "She also advocated for children affected by the opioid crisis, and has since started a foundation that raises education funds for children in foster care.",
      "Many expect for that work to continue once she moves back to Washington, though it remains unclear if she will live there full-time.",
      "Prof Vigil says the role of first lady has evolved over the years and Mrs Trump will \"make choices about how active in public she wants to be\".",

    "summary": "Justice DY Chandrachud retired as India\u2019s chief justice on Sunday. Many are debating his legacy.",
    "story": [
      "How will history judge my tenure?",
      "That\u2019s a question Dhananjay Yashwant Chandrachud, who retired as India\u2019s 50th chief justice on Sunday, asked just weeks before he finished his term.",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his mind was \u201cheavily preoccupied with fears and anxieties about the future and the past\u201d.",
      "\u201cI find myself pondering: Did I achieve everything I set out to do? How will history judge my tenure? Could I have done things differently? What legacy will I leave for future generations of judges and legal professionals?\u201d he said.",
      "The soul searching came at a time when many in India are also debating what legacy he leaves behind.",
      "Justice Chandrachud served more than eight years as a top court judge and as chief justice for the past two years. He presided over one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world with jurisdiction over India\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens.",
      "The top court is the final court of appeal, the final interpreter of the constitution and its judgements, which are binding on all other courts in India, routinely make news - although judges seldom do.",
      "But Justice Chandrachud, sometimes described as India\u2019s \u201cfirst celebrity judge\u201d and a \"rockstar judge\", has routinely hit the headlines.",
      "According to Arghya Sengupta of the Vidhi Centre For Legal Policy, the jurist was India's most prolific chief justice who wrote 93 judgements - more than his last four predecessors put together \u2013 including some on matters of seminal importance. He also made huge strides in terms of digitisation and livestreaming of court hearings \u2013 making them more accessible to citizens.",
      "But some of the recent coverage has also been unflattering, with critics saying he wasn't assertive enough and his tenure has been disappointing.",
      "The Harvard-educated judge has many firsts to his name \u2013 he was the youngest to head a high court and his two-year-term was the longest for a chief justice in more than a decade. He\u2019s also the only chief justice whose father also served in the role.",
      "During his years in the Supreme Court, he developed a reputation for being a progressive, liberal judge known for his nuanced and thoughtful judgements related to matters of liberty, freedom of speech and gender and LGBT rights.",
      "He was part of landmark rulings that decriminalised homosexuality and allowed menstruating women into Kerala\u2019s Sabarimala shrine. His utterances on the right to privacy and right to dissent were extensively praised.",
      "So, his elevation to be India\u2019s top judge in November 2022 was welcomed by senior lawyers, activists and citizens with many expressing a \u201cstrong hope that under his leadership the court will rise to greater heights\u201d.",
      "It was a time when India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was getting ready to secure a third term in the 2024 general election.",
      "Opposition parties, activists and sections of the press were accusing the government of targeting them, with global rights organisations saying Indian democracy was under threat.",
      "Although the government denied any wrongdoing, many of India\u2019s top academics, rights activists and popular opposition leaders found themselves in jail and the country kept sliding on the global press freedom index. (The government has always rejected such ratings, saying they are biased against India.)",
      "Senior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says Justice Chandrachud\u2019s appointment had come at \u201ca crucial juncture as some of the last chief justices had left under a cloud of dark spots and the position had been denigrated with serious allegations\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo, we thought Justice Chandrachud would use his erudition and brilliant mind to do a lot of good for the citizens. But he has been disappointing,\u201d she said.",
      "Senior Supreme Court lawyer Chander Uday Singh says his record is \u201ca mixed bag\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn his judgments, he would lay down the law brilliantly which could be used as a precedent for future cases. But whenever the state was heavily invested in any issue, he failed to hold power to account, so the state got away with what they had set out of achieve.\u201d",
      "For instance, he points out that the court struck down a government scheme that allowed people to make anonymous donations to political parties, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. \u201cBut then he did not hold anyone accountable for the illegality.\u201d",
      "Similarly, when it came to a political crisis in the western state of Maharashtra or Delhi\u2019s power struggle with the federal government, his judgments tended to favour the government, he adds.",
      "\u201cThere was hope that through his judgments, he would set things right in a country that is under a strong majoritarian government. But he fell short.\u201d",
      "Several top lawyers have also criticised Justice Chandrachud for what he did as the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d by failing to effectively prevent the prolonged incarceration of political prisoners - leading to the death of some of them without ever getting bail. This happened despite Justice Chandrachud saying that bail should be the norm and not the exception.",
      "And as he neared his retirement, Justice Chandrachud also made headlines for what he did not in the court, but outside.",
      "In September, there was uproar over a viral video that showed him praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival.",
      "Ms Jaiswal said by publicising the photo, \u201ca message was being sent that the chief justice is close to the PM\u201d. Lawyers, former judges, opposition politicians and many citizens also criticised him saying \u201cthe presence of a politician at a private event erodes the perception of impartiality of the judiciary\u201d.",
      "Another burst of criticism greeted Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment last month when he said he had asked God for a solution to the vexed Babri Mosque-Ram temple dispute. \u201cI sat before the deity and told him he needed to find a solution and he gave it to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The comment led to a firestorm of criticism, not entirely unexpected as the mosque-temple dispute has been one of the most contentious and religiously polarising issues in modern India.",
      "The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. A five-judge bench, which included Justice Chandrachud, ruled in 2019 that the demolition was illegal, but still gave the disputed land to Hindus and a separate site for the mosque to be built. Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated a grand new temple at the site, fulfilling a longstanding promise by his party.",
      "So, no surprise then that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment, seen by many as religious, was extensively criticised.",
      "Retired high court judge Anjana Prakash told HW news that his comment was \u201cdramatic, filmy and laughable and it had brought down the level of judiciary\u201d.",
      "\u201cA judge has to decide cases on principles of law. Where does God come into a judgement? Besides, people have different gods. And if a justice from another faith had said this, would the reaction be the same?\u201d she asked.",
      "Justice Prakash and other critics wondered if he was cosying up to the government for a post-retirement assignment.",
      "In the days preceding his retirement, Justice Chandrachud addressed some of the criticism in interactions with the media.",
      "\u201cThe separation of powers doesn\u2019t mean antagonistic relations between the executive and the judiciary, it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot meet,\u201d he said at an event by the Indian Express newspaper, adding that such meetings were not used \u201cto cut deals\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate proof of our good behaviour lies in the written word \u2013 in our judgements. Is it consistent with the constitution or not?\u201d",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his comment on seeking divine guidance was because \u201cI am a person of faith\u201d and \u201cto impute motives to judges is not right\u201d.",
      "He added that courts were facing pressure \u201cfrom lobbies and pressure groups\u201d and they would praise a decision critical of the government, but if he ruled in favour of the government, they questioned his independence.",
      "At his farewell on Friday, the outgoing chief justice said he was perhaps India\u2019s most trolled judge, but his \u201cshoulders are broad enough to accept all criticism\u201d.",
      "And at the weekend, he told Times of India that he believed he had \u201cleft the system better than I found it\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m retiring with a sense of satisfaction,\u201d he said.",

      "As leaders of dozens of Arab and Islamic nations gather in the Saudi capital for a summit, there is widespread speculation about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the region.",
      "In sharp contrast to the fears voiced in Europe about Donald Trump\u2019s famous unpredictability, Gulf Arab countries tend to view him as a force for stability.",
      "Writing in the officially approved Arab News opinion column, the prominent UAE business leader Khalaf al-Habtoor says: \u201cIn a Middle East where security is paramount, Trump\u2019s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a way forward.\u201d",
      "Here in Saudi Arabia, Trump is viewed much more favourably than Joe Biden.",
      "Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip as President in 2017, an idea reportedly brokered by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump enjoys warm relations with the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials, MBS. The crown prince has never forgiven or forgotten Biden saying that Saudi Arabia needed to be made a pariah for its attitude to human rights.",
      "Trump\u2019s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East.",
      "On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as well as Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.",
      "Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran.",
      "In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region.",
      "In 2020, to Iran\u2019s fury but to the satisfaction of many in the Gulf Arab states, Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "But today\u2019s Middle East is not the same as the one when Trump left the White House.",
      "Israel is at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged blows with both the Houthis in Yemen and their backers in Iran.",
      "Under the Biden administration US influence in the region is seen to have waned with a White House largely ineffective at restraining its close ally, Israel, as it wages war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House is thought likely to give Israel a freer hand to strike targets in Iran - like oil and nuclear facilities - that the Biden administration said were off limits.",
      "\u201cHis staunch support for Israel and aggressive stance towards Iran\u2019s destabilising efforts made him a key ally in the region, and his return to power is expected to intensify efforts to limit Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d former Israeli intelligence officer Joshua Steinrich says.",
      "But something else has changed in the region.",
      "Brokered by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to put aside their differences, ending seven years of hostility, characterised most visibly by the war in Yemen where the Saudi air force bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels.",
      "On Sunday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s military chief flew to Tehran to meet his Iranian counterpart, with both countries now talking about deepening their co-operation on defence and security.",
      "Ever since Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab neighbours in the region have viewed Iran as a major threat to their security. But the surprise 2019 drone strike on Saudi oil facilities, attributed to Iran-backed militants in Iraq, was an uncomfortable reminder to the Gulf Arab states as to just how vulnerable they were to attack by Iran.",
      "So today, with an Arab and Islamic summit calling for an end to the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, there is both optimism and a degree of uncertainty about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the Middle East.",

      "South Sudan is the world\u2019s youngest country and one of its poorest, with a government hugely dependent on oil revenue.",
      "Unity State, a major oil-producing state, has always experienced seasonal flooding. But in 2019, extreme rains brought a deluge that engulfed villages, grasslands and forests. Year after year of intense rainfall followed. The water built up, trapped on the clay soil.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:59:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Vistara is operating its last flight on Monday as it completes its merger with Air India.",
    "story": [
      "Indian full-service carrier Vistara will operate its last flight on Monday, after nine years in existence.",
      "A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet.",
      "This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months.",
      "\u201cAs part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India,\u201d an Air India spokesperson said in an email response.",
      "Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistara's in-flight experience will remain unchanged.",
      "Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts.",
      "The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistara\u2019s books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst.",
      "Air India has essentially been \u201csuckered into taking a loss-making airline\u201d in a desperate move, he added.",
      "\"Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them.\"",
      "To be sure, both Air India and Vistara\u2019s annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent.",
      "The exercise has been riddled with problems \u2013 from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India.",
      "There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems.",
      "The Tatas have announced a $400m (\u00a3308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. They\u2019ve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering.",
      "But this \u201cturnaround\u201d is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters.",
      "Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too.",
      "Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling \u201cemotional\u201d that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a \u201cgold standard for Indian aviation\u201d was ceasing operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a big loss for the industry,\u201d said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply \u201ccopy, paste and exceed\u201d the high standards set by Vistara, given that it\u2019s a much smaller airline that\u2019s being gobbled up by a much larger one.",
      "Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it.",
      "\u201cThis would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness,\u201d he adds.",
      "Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges.",
      "\"Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding,\" says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. \"Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks.\"",
      "Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistara's agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air India's complex bureaucracy and systems.",
      "But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience.",
      "These are \u201ctwo airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective,\u201d said Mr Martin.",
      "Still, many believe Vistara had to go \u2013 now or some years later.",
      "A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and 'India' imprinted in its identity, wouldn\u2019t have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process.",
      "Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another.",
      "The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo.",
      "The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) \u201cwill be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce\u201d, an Air India spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cGetting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn,\u201d said Mr Awtaney.",
      "But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways.",
      "It\u2019s still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void."

      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",

      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",

      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",

      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",

      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",

      "Rail Baltica began as a grand project, but it has now become a strategic imperative: since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics increasingly view their neighbour as an existential threat.",
      "Currently, there is no direct link that crosses the Baltics and connects with Poland.",
      "Rail Baltica will do that, cutting travel time and bringing economic and environmental benefits, but the costs of this ambitious scheme are mounting.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltic states and their Nato allies need the railway in place fast.",
      "Estonia's Infrastructure Minister Vladimir Svet said the rail link is vital amid the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin's aggressive regime is trying to recreate an imperial project on the territory of the former Soviet bloc.\"",
      "The memory of decades of Soviet occupation is still fresh in the Baltics. Moscow deported hundreds of thousands of people from the region to Siberia.",
      "Estonia and Latvia share land borders with Russia, while Lithuania is adjacent to the Russian enclave Kaliningrad, which also shares a border with Poland, and Moscow's close ally, Belarus.",
      "About 10,000 Nato soldiers are currently stationed in the Baltics, alongside local troops. Their total number could reach 200,000 in a worst-case scenario.",

      "For Estonia's infrastructure minister, the railway is \u201can unbreakable link with the networks of Europe\u201d.",
      "Not far from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, at the tip of the railway, dozens of workers are welding and hammering away at the new \u00dclemiste passenger terminal.",
      "\u201cThis will be the network's most northern point, the starting point of 215km of railway in Estonia and 870km across the three Baltic States,\u201d said Anvar Salomets, CEO of Rail Baltica Estonia, stepping carefully across the embryonic platforms.",
      "Until now, the Baltics have used a Russian track width because their rail system dates back to the Soviet era.",

      "That means journey times from Tallinn to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, will be massively reduced, from at least 12 hours now to under four.",
      "\u201cIt'll be a game-changer, decreasing the environmental impact across our whole transport sector,\u201d says Salomets, who foresees big economic benefits.",
      "Recent analysis for the Rail Baltica consortium estimates the overall economic boost at \u20ac6.6bn (\u00a35.5bn).",

      "So far, the EU has subsidised 85% of the project and has just announced another \u20ac1.1bn.",
      "Estonia and Latvia have also come under criticism for focusing on putting up the rail terminals first before they build the mainline.",
      "French engineer Emilien Dang, whose RB Rail oversees the project, blamed recent global crises for the big spike in costs: \u201cOur initial estimate hadn't taken into account the Covid pandemic and high inflation - and the situation in Ukraine has dramatically increased the cost of material.\u201d",
      "As he walked across a big new terminal in the Latvian capital Riga, he also cited cultural issues.",
      "\u201cThe view from France, wrongly, is that the Baltics are one unit.  But they are three countries, with different regulations.\u201d",
      "The Baltic states have decided to split the project into two phases. The first, costing \u20ac15bn, will have a single instead of double track laid by 2030 and focus on the most important train stops.",
      "The second track and additional train stations are to be completed as part of a second phase with no specific completion date yet.",
      "The soaring costs have prompted the states to scale back some of their ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe can further scale back the scope of phase one, for example by connecting Riga airport at a later stage,\u201d said Andris Kulbergs, who chairs a Latvian parliamentary committee investigating the project.",
      "As billions of euros for the first phase are yet to be secured, that might be necessary.",
      "Estonia's national auditor Janar Holm believes several more years of delays are likely: \u201cWe have to find the funds to build this railway now or it'll be even more expensive.\u201d",
      "The country's infrastructure minister, Vladimir Svet, insisted \"we are decreasing the budget as much as possible, we\u2019ve rationalised the public procurement process and, if necessary, we'll take on a loan.\"",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",

      "Asked what he thinks he can get out of musicians that maybe other people don't, Burnett said, \"Well, what I try to get out of them is just their full love, their full being.\"",
      "He certainly did with Robert Plant and Alison Krauss on \"Raising Sand,\" and won the Grammy for album of the year in 2009:",
      "He described \"accidentally\" ending up in the commercial mainstream in a big way a couple of times. \"I mean, it's always a fluke, but, yes, I have.\"",
      "\"Has that surprised you?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Yeah. Well, in a way, there have been times when you see around a corner, like with 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'\"",
      "Burnett produced and curated the music for the 2000 Coen Brothers film:",
      "\"When the Coens came and said they wanted to do a movie about the history of American music, I thought, oh, this all fits together,\" said Burnett.",

      "Mason asked, \"When you're working on a TV project or a film, what do you see the role of music as? Is it an effective character in a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah, sometimes it is,\" said Burnett. \"It's always the subconscious, the unconscious of the character.\"",
      "\"In 'True Detective,\" it's almost like you were trying to curate a vibe.\"",
      "\"That was a vibe and it had to do with the swamp, and it had to do with the darkness of it all.\"",
      "\"Sounds kind of fun, actually!\"",
      "\"It was so fun!\" Burnett laughed. \"That's what I mean. It's fun to do the dark world, you know, as long as you don't have to actually live in it!\"",
      "Joseph Henry Burnett III grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. He can't recall how he got his nickname T Bone.",
      "He was on the high school golf team. Golfing great Ben Hogan practiced at the course where he played: \"And when he would hit that ball in those pecan trees over there, the resonance, that's one of the places where I began falling in love with sound, actually, on the golf course, 'cause he would hit, crack that thing and you could hear it all through the trees. Isn't that crazy? You know, I'm just sonically oriented.\"",
      "In 1975, Bob Dylan recruited Burnett to play guitar in his \"Rolling Thunder\" revue, starting a lifelong friendship. In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",
      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",
      "Burnett said, \"I love the process of recording. I love going into a room where there's nothing, and then you come out and there's something.\"",
      "\"It's a mystical kind of thing,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Yeah, it is to me. And you build a world of resonance, and that's the stuff that's the most thrilling to me, and the part of life that a machine will never comprehend.\"",
      "T Bone Burnett's new record earned a Grammy nomination this past week for best Americana album, and at 76, he's even starting to enjoy another sound \u2026 the sound of a crowd. \"I think I had a much more benevolent view of the audience than I used to have,\" he said.",
      "\"And that's because you're just not overthinking it?\" asked Mason.",
      "\"Yeah. That's exactly right!\" he laughed.",

      "Bloomberg News reports\u00a0the suit was filed days after a meeting last weekend between the justice department and heads of both health care companies failed to quell concerns of possible antitrust issues, despite the companies' joint offer to sell off 100-plus clinics to a Texas-based competitor.",
      "The justice department believes the acquisition could \"lead to higher prices in home health care in regions where Amedisys is a main competitor\" to LHC Group, Bloomberg reports, a business UnitedHealth purchased in 2023.

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",

      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",

      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",

      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",

Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",

      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",

      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",

      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots.

      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "title": "What could Trump's return, and his tariffs, actually mean for China?",
    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",

      "When asked if he'd step down if Trump requested it, Powell responded with a one-word answer: \"No.\"",
      "Powell's insistence that he'll remain in his role comes after Trump aired grievances about the Fed's decision-making during his first presidency and, more recently, on the campaign trial. Trump, who has accused Powell of being \"political,\" also told Bloomberg Businessweek this summer he would let the economist serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Yet Trump has also said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\"\u00a0Trump\u00a0said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",
      "Fed Chair Powell's term",
      "Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",

      "\"I'm not going to get into the political things here today,\" Powell said in response to a question from CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "Powell also noted that the election in the near-term will have no impact on the central bank's rate decisions, with the Fed instead relying on economic data for its decisions. For now, he added, it's not clear what policies or tax changes may emerge from a second Trump presidency.",
      "Many of Trump's proposals, such as tax cuts, must be passed by Congress before being signed into law by the president.",

      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election.

In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",

      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",

      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",
      "\"PE should remain an available option for consumers, because Americans deserve the option to choose the safe and effective OTC medicines they prefer and rely on,\" Scott Melville, CHPA's president and CEO, said in a statement.",

      "Spokespeople for drugmakers behind the brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",
      "\"Let me be clear, oral phenylephrine is not a safety risk,\" Hatton, a professor at the University of Florida, told CBS News last year. \"It just doesn't work.\"",
      "In a scientific review published this week by the FDA, the agency's scientists concluded that past studies estimating that higher percentages of the drug could be absorbed during digestion were \"an overestimate and based on outdated technology.\"",
      "Less than 1% of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream after being swallowed, they estimated. Far higher doses could \"be needed to achieve a clinically meaningful outcome which would raise significant questions about safety.\"",
      "\"Furthermore, there are no clinical data demonstrating that oral PE is effective as a nasal decongestant at any dosage,\" the FDA's scientists wrote.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that would have required public schools statewide to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms by Jan. 1. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles of Baton Rouge, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled Tuesday that the law violates the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.",
      "The ruling found the Louisiana law was \"unconstitutional on its face and in every application,\" prohibited Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and defendants in this case from enforcing the mandate, and required them to notify public schools of the change. Tuesday's decision came alongside a preliminary injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by parents of Louisiana public school students, who are represented by a legal team from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",
      "Defendants include Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, along with members of the state education board and other local school boards, all of whom the attorney general represents.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican whose push to integrate elements of his own Christian faith into secular life has been central to his political platform, signed the Ten Commandments legislation into law in June. Referred to as HB 71 in the ongoing lawsuit, it ordered all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities in Louisiana to display a poster-sized printout of the commandments \u2014 a set of moral directives essentially meant to lay the foundation of certain religious sects, including the Christian church \u2014 in \"large, easily readable font\" starting next year.",
      "Proponents of the law argued it would reinstate a former relic of \"state and national history, culture, and tradition\" in Louisiana's public education spaces and claimed the measure was not only rooted in religion. But those who opposed the legislation raised questions about its constitutionality.",
      "In an original complaint challenging the Ten Commandments law, the ACLU claimed it amounted to a violation of church and state and would effectively discriminate against students, particularly students who are not Christian. Their lawsuit sought a court order declaring HB 71 infringed on the constitutional religious rights laid out by the First Amendment, which forbids the government from \"establishing\" a religion, or favoring one religion over others, and protects the religious liberties of individual citizens.",
      "\"The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,\" read the original complaint. \"The law's primary sponsor and author, Representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'\"",
      "The ACLU said in a statement its lawsuit represented a group of plaintiffs \"who are Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious.\" Each felt \"the newly enacted statute violates longstanding U.S. Supreme Court precedent\" along with the U.S. Constitution, the statement added.",

    "summary": "Senator-elect Ruben Gallego has some advice for Democrats: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
    "story": [
      "As Democrats work to sort out last week's election results and determine why they lost Latino men in droves, a Latino Democrat and senator-elect has some advice for party leaders and top consultants: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
      "CBS News Tuesday projected Gallego as the victor in Arizona's U.S. Senate contest against Republican Kari Lake. He believes much of his party is out of touch with a key demographic he says they can't win national elections without.",
      "\"There is no winning nationally without Latinos,\" Gallego said in an extensive interview with CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe Tuesday. \"...There's no path forward into the Democratic Party, into a national party, without Latinos.\"",
      "Exit polls show Vice President Kamala Harris lost Latino men to President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 a significant blow to a party that's long relied on them as part of a broad coalition. The results were openly feared most of the past year by Democratic Party leaders and operatives.",
      "Going forward, Gallego said candidates need to go out and find Latinos where they already are. Gallego focused on bringing his campaign to Latino voters \u2014 sometimes, without talking about politics at all. His campaign hosted rodeos, boxing match watch parties, and carne asada cookouts. His team took food to construction shift workers at work sites after they'd clocked out in the early morning. Knocking on people's doors, after shift workers are exhausted and preparing for the next day, won't work, he said.",
      "\"Talk to them. And talk to them as often as possible,\" Gallego said. \"And don't expect you to be able to talk to them one way through TV.\"",
      "There are \"millions and millions\" of Latino men out there, Gallego said, and they're not afraid to speak their mind.",
      "Democrats on the national stage also missed the mark in how they spoke about immigration. Gallego's first Spanish-language TV ad was about border security. Latinos in Arizona looked at the migration crisis at the border, with refugees pouring into the country, and called it \"chaos,\" Gallego said.",
      "While campaigning, \"We didn't actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesn't believe it anymore,\" Gallego said, meaning, Latino voters don't believe Washington will actually pass a massive immigration reform bill in the near future.",
      "Instead, Congress needs to focus on fortifying U.S.-Mexico border security first to build trust, he said.",
      "But that message, O'Keefe suggested, may be a hard pill to swallow for fellow Democrats.",
      "\"I'm a pharmacist about to give out very hard pills in the Senate,\" Gallego said.",
      "Gallego also hinted that Democrats missed the mark on addressing inflation. Born on the south side of Chicago to a Colombian mother and a Mexican father, with his mother raising four children alone, Gallego said he knows what it's like to grow up struggling. He saw the flashing warning signs on inflation, not just in the polls, but as he talked with his working-class family members and constituents.",
      "\"Growing up working class, there's nothing more hurtful than working hard and then not being able to provide for your family,\" Gallego said. \"And I instinctively knew that's what these men were going through.\"",
      "\"This is the first time I've ever seen men say I can't do this,\" Gallego said. \"I can't keep working, and it's still not making a difference, and that's when I realized it was really kind of a problem.\"",
      "Raised by his mother, Gallego became a U.S. Marine and served in the Iraq war. He moved to Arizona for a local political job, ran and won a seat in the state House before winning his first congressional race in 2014, representing most of Phoenix and Glendale.",
      "He began on Capitol Hill with an outspoken progressive reputation and was among the Democrats calling on the U.S. Senate to abandon the filibuster. But Gallego has shifted his politics to the center in recent years, a reflection of the state's roughly three-way voter registration split between Democrats, Republicans and independents.",
      "He launched his Senate campaign nearly two years ago, focusing early advertising and outreach on his military service, a key credential in a state with a hefty military and veteran population and a history of electing military veterans, including the late Republican Sen. John McCain, to Congress. With nominal Democratic primary opposition and polls giving him an early lead, independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced in March she would not run for reelection, avoiding a three-way contest.",
      "Until Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of McCain's term after his death.",
      "In his race, Gallego wasn't about to give up on Trump voters \u2014 or any voters, he said.",
      "A rising star in the party \u2014 a veteran and Latino who was victorious in a state Trump won \u2014 Gallego brushed off questions about a future bid for president.",
      "\"Can I rule out running? I can \u2014 I can rule out a lot of things,\" Gallego said. \"First thing I want to focus on is this U.S. Senate race.\"",
      "\"That's not a no,\" O'Keefe pointed out.",
      "\"It's not a yes, either,\" Gallego said, adding a Spanish word for patience: \"C\u00e1lmate.\"",

    "summary": "Jack Teixeira admitted he illegally posted sensitive military information in online chat rooms.",
    "story": [
      "Boston \u2014 Former Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who admitted he illegally posted sensitive military information to online chat rooms in what prosecutors called one of the \"most prolific\" and \"rare\" government leak operations, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a Boston federal judge on Tuesday.",
      "Teixeira, a 22-year-old Massachusetts native, pleaded guilty in March to six counts of violating the Espionage Act, acknowledging he was behind the yearlong distribution of dozens of classified government documents \u2014 including some marked \"top secret\" \u2014 on Discord, a social media platform. The classified documents involved in the leak touched on a number of sensitive issues, but the most notable were about Russia's war in Ukraine, detailed troop movements and timelines for Western weapons deliveries to the war-torn country, investigators said.",
      "Judge Indira Talwani, who imposed the sentence, formally accepted the plea agreement on Tuesday and told Teixeira, \"You posted on the internet on Discord hundreds of documents over a period of a year\u2026I don't find any ambiguity here as to what you were doing being wrong.\"",
      "Federal law enforcement arrested Teixeira at his family's Massachusetts home after a weekslong probe into how sensitive Pentagon records were ending up online.",
      "Prosecutors asked Talwani to sentence the defendant to 200 months in prison \u2014 almost 17 years \u2014 for his central role in \"one of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history,\" one that has prompted reforms in the handling of classified information.",
      "\"The harm the defendant caused to the national security from his disclosures of national defense information is extraordinary,\" prosecutors wrote in an October court filing. In court on Tuesday, government attorneys reiterated their stance, arguing, \"The damage he caused is historic.\"",
      "\"The defendant's actions directly aided our adversaries and damaged our alliances,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared Dolan said. \"Jack Teixeira\u2026 will be a cautionary tale for the men and women of the United States military\u2026They are going to be told 'This is what happens if you break your promises. This is what happens if you break your oath.'\"",
      "Wearing an orange prison uniform, Teixeira, whose family was seated in the courtroom gallery behind him, asked the judge for leniency and expressed remorse.",
      "\"I'm sorry for all of the harm that I've brought and I've caused,\" he said Tuesday. \"I understand that all of the responsibility and consequences falls upon my shoulders alone.\"",
      "For over a year, investigators said Teixeira, who had top secret security clearance as an IT worker at the Otis Air National Guard Base, accessed the classified documents illegally and either hand-copied the information or printed the records before posting the data in the Discord chat rooms. He even messaged individuals in his forums and offered to find specific information about \"happenings that pertain to your country,\" court records said.",
      "The national defense information began appearing online in February 2022, but investigators didn't link the leaks to Teixeira for over a year. Prosecutors alleged Teixeira knew his conduct was illegal and accused him of violating his oath to serve.",
      "As the investigation into the leaks zeroed in on Teixeira's unit, prosecutors alleged in previous court documents that Teixeira began instructing others in the Discord group to \"delete all messages.\"",
      "\"[i]f anyone comes looking, don't tell them sh**,\" he allegedly wrote to one user. And he told another, \"Try to delete all my messages in civil discussions.\"",
      "\"In the aggregate, the defendant's criminal conduct over the course of more than a year 'critically and negatively impacted' the Department of Defense's mission, endangered his fellow soldiers, other citizens, and allied governments throughout the world,\" prosecutors argued last month, urging the judge to impose a heavy sentence.",
      "Teixeira's defense attorney, however, asked for a sentence of 11 years in prison, telling the judge in court filings, \"His intent was never to harm the United States,\" but to \"educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation.\"",
      "\"That makes no sense, with all due respect,\" the judge shot back in court on Tuesday when Teixeira's defense attorney repeated that point and said his client had an \"obsessive need to tell the truth.\"",
      "\"What you have convinced me of is he had an obsessive need to talk,\" the judge retorted. \"I see why you're saying he wasn't trying to harm the government.\"",
      "Revealing that Teixeira was diagnosed with autism, his lawyer wrote in an October court filing that \"his motives and decisions were na\u00efve, not nefarious.\" Teixeira accepted responsibility for the admitted crimes, including by participating in an hourslong briefing with members of the intelligence community, the defense filings argued.",
      "\"The actions of Jack Teixeira are inexcusable,\" the attorney wrote, describing his client not as a criminal leaker but as a misguided young person swept up in an online ecosystem. \"However, Jack is still essentially a child \u2013 at the very least, a 'youthful offender' \u2013 who has his whole life in front of him.\"",
      "Prosecutors disagreed with this characterization, telling the judge his age should not affect the sentence. \"Our military is built on the backbone of people his age and younger,\" Dolan said, arguing that Teixeira accepted responsibility to defend the nation. \"This was not based on impulse. If it was, it was an impulsive decision that he made every single day that he went to work for a year,\" the prosecutor added.",
      "But Teixeira's attorney, Michael Bachrach, pushed back in court, pointing out the 11 years in prison he requested amounted to about half Teixeira's life.",
      "\"It does seem that your autism has affected your ability to make friendships and to understand other people's hurts perhaps,\" the judge told Teixeira. \"It isn't that that's something that explains what you did. I think it is something that you need to think about how you're going to avoid anything like this going forward.\"",
      "Following Teixeira's arrest, the Air Force inspector general found that individuals in his Massachusetts unit failed to take proper action after at least four separate security incidents. Members of his unit \"enabled\" the leaks by not properly supervising his access to classified information, the review concluded. The Air National Guard took action against 15 individuals for \"dereliction in the performance of duties\" as a result of the report's findings.",
      "Texeira also faces charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice in a military court martial, which are expected to be adjudicated in March.",

      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",

      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 13:29:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position.",
    "story": [
      "Last week,\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0announced his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as his White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position. Calling her \"tough, smart, innovative..., universally admired and respected,\" Trump credited her with helping him win both the 2024 and 2016 elections.",
      "Behind the scenes",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on any stage \u2014 or in front of cameras. In keeping with that, when Trump\u00a0declared victory\u00a0in the early hours of last Wednesday morning, he invited her to come to the microphones, but she politely declined.",
      "She's managed to not just curry favor, but more critically, to remain in good standing with Trump, winning his trust while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",
      "Relationship with campaign staff",
      "Wiles is beloved by the Trump campaign staff, many of whom call her a mentor.",
      "\"Susie Wiles is a tremendous advocate for President Trump and a great boss to those that work for her,\" said Trump senior adviser Danielle Alvarez. \"She knows how to bring people together.\"",
      "\"For myself and countless others, having Susie Wiles as a mentor and a friend is a gift,\" said Brian Hughes, another senior adviser. \"The nation will see that with President Trump in the White House with Susie as the COS the next four years will be America's best.\"",
      "Those who have worked for Wiles \"will take a bullet for Susie,\" said Carlos Trujillo, a campaign adviser who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. Trujillo said most people don't see Wiles' motherly and grandmotherly side. \"She always made sure her people were taken care of,\" he said. \"She's very soft spoken, but she holds everyone accountable, and it's always done through love and kindness but never a place of hate.\"",
      "Management style",
      "Staffers say Wiles runs a tight and focused ship. Trump's 2024 campaign did not go through the big, dramatic shakeups or infighting that characterized his previous campaigns. Wiles' appointment signals that as president-elect, he wants to run his administration in a similar way.",
      "Wiles' legacy, Trujillo said, is her ability to cultivate talent. \"Susie in politics is the greatest coach of all time...she's going to be able to recruit the best talent.\"",
      "And while Wiles shies away from the spotlight, she made a rare comment on X when businessman Mark Cuban, in an interview on ABC's \"The View,\" accused Trump of not associating with \"strong, intelligent women.\" In response, Wiles\u00a0posted\u00a0for the first time this year: \"I'm told [Mark Cuban] needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are!\"",
      "Background",
      "After Trump won the 2016 election, Wiles, who was the chief strategist in Florida for his campaign, was dispatched in late September of 2018 to help Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid to be Florida governor. At the time, he was trailing Democrat Andrew Gillum in several polls.",
      "After helping DeSantis win, however, Wiles was shut out of his inner circle, according to\u00a0The Atlantic's Tim Alberta. Wiles told Alberta that working for DeSantis was the \"biggest mistake\" of her career. She returned to the Trump campaign and ran his Florida campaign in 2020, and then after his loss, she went on to run Trump's Save America PAC.",
      "As Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, Wiles, along with Chris LaCivita, hatched a plan to recruit, register and turn out Trump's low-propensity voters, Alberta reported. During the primary campaign, they pursued people in the reddest areas of the country who liked Trump but weren't habitual voters and in many cases, weren't even registered to vote. During the general campaign, Wiles and LaCivita raised a volunteer army to take on the legions of canvassers paid by Kamala Harris' cash-rich coffers.",
      "Wiles is a native of New Jersey, the daughter of the renowned late NFL kicker and sportscaster Pat Summerall. Soon after she graduated from college at the University of Maryland, she worked for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, and later went on to work in Florida politics. In 2010, she helped Sen. Rick Scott win his election against Democrat Bill McCollum, and she has also been a political consultant in Florida.",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction lives on, at least for another week.",
      "A New York judge on Tuesday deferred making an immediate decision on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring \u2014 and if the verdict should be tossed.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan said he will rule next week on whether a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts precludes a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan did not directly address sentencing, which had been scheduled for Nov. 26.",
      "A prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg emailed Merchan Sunday night, saying Trump asked for a pause \"based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.\"",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" wrote the prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, who added there's a need to balance the interests of \"a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and the Office of the President.\"",
      "Trump lawyer Emil Bove followed up in his own email to Merchan, writing that a \"stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "The long-awaited ruling, on whether evidence shown at trial should have been shielded from jurors, due to presidential immunity, could have profound consequences for the case.",
      "Trump was the first former president ever to be convicted of crimes. On Nov. 5, he also became the first person with a criminal record ever to be elected president.",
      "Trump's lawyers vowed the day a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. They were given an extraordinary opportunity not long after when the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The decision said evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's legal team, which is led by Todd Blanche, seized on the landmark ruling, demanding Trump's conviction be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They argued jurors should never have heard testimony related to Trump's communications with former White House communications director Hope Hicks, or his former executive assistant and director of White House Operations Madeleine Westerhout.",
      "Prosecutors argued in response that the Supreme Court ruling didn't apply to evidence shown at trial. They also said the material protested by Trump's lawyers were \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered.",
      "The jury ultimately concluded that Trump committed 34 felonies in signing off on a scheme to cover-up reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen had paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years early. The agreement has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision in July was the latest curveball in a case that dates back to 2018, when the Manhattan District Attorney's office first began investigating the \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump, amid his first term as president, fought the investigation as it expanded into a wide-ranging probe of his finances. The case's first landmark Supreme Court ruling came in 2020, when the nation's highest court ruled the Constitution does not preclude a state criminal subpoena of a sitting president. The ruling allowed the Manhattan District Attorney, then Cyrus Vance Jr., access to Trump's tax returns.",
      "The borough's next district attorney, Alvin Bragg, took up the case but narrowed its focus, bringing it back to the \"hush money\" deal. On March 31, 2023, a grand jury made Trump the first ever former, and future, president indicted for crimes.",
      "Trump's seven-week trial began just more than a year later, on April 15. The jury returned his conviction after a day and a half of deliberations.",
      "Trump, sullen but defiant, walked out of the courtroom and in front of cameras just steps away immediately returned to his campaign for the presidency.",

Foreign nationals are barred from contributing to federal elections, and only LVMH employees who are U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents can legally donate.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his state prosecution to federal court in the case stemming from an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "The court's denial of Meadows' appeal leaves in place a lower court decision that returned the prosecution to state court. Meadows and President-elect Donald Trump, for whom he worked, were charged alongside 17 others by Fulton County prosecutors for their alleged efforts to reverse Trump's electoral loss in Georgia in 2020.",
      "They pleaded not guilty to all charges. Proceedings have been on hold for months as a Georgia appeals court is set to consider in December whether to allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies.",
      "Meadows served as Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021 and was a prominent figure in the president-elect's attempts to stay in office for a consecutive term after the November 2020 presidential election.",
      "Two counts were brought against him by Fulton County prosecutors: the first alleges that he engaged in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy with Trump, and the second alleges he participated in an effort to solicit a public officer, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to violate his oath of office.",
      "Meadows is portrayed in the indictment returned in August 2023 as a go-between for Trump and others involved in coordinating the strategy for contesting the 2020 election and disrupting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. He participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes, enough to make him the winner of Georgia's election.",
      "After Meadows was charged, he sought to transfer the case to federal court under a federal officer removal statute and argued that the actions alleged in the indictment related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "The district court, however, sent the case back to the Fulton County Superior Court. While U.S. District Judge Steve Jones conceded that some of the charged conduct involved Meadows' official duties, there was not enough evidence to establish that a \"heavy majority\" of the acts alleged against him related to his role as chief of staff.",

      "\"At bottom, whatever the chief of staff's role with respect to state election administration, that role does not include altering valid election results in favor of a particular candidate,\" Chief Judge William Pryor wrote for the three-judge panel.",
      "Meadows appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that whether a chief of staff prosecuted based on actions related to his work for the president can remove his case to federal court is not a close call.",
      "Calling the 11th Circuit's decision \"miserly and counterintuitive,\" Meadow's lawyers warned in a filing that allowing it to stand would open former federal officers up to politicized state prosecutions for unpopular federal policies.",
      "\"The chief of staff is a unique federal officer, the top aide to a coequal branch of government personified by the president,\" they wrote. \"If former officers cannot remove at all, and if even a current chief of staff cannot remove a case arising out of acts taken in the White House in service of the president, then the floodgates are open, and 'nightmare scenarios' will not take long to materialize.\"",
      "Fulton County prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to reject Meadows' appeal and leave the 11th Circuit's decision in place. They noted that Trump did not even move his case to federal court, and said Meadows failed to \"articulate any coherent source of authority for the president or his staff to supervise or affect a state's administration of elections.\"",

      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

      "During this Congress, Stefanik made headlines for her grilling of university presidents during a hearing about their response to antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel by Hamas.

      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that he's appointing a \"border czar,\" former Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director and immigration hardliner Tom Homan, to join his administration. Homan, however, may not be the only such \"czar\" in the Trump administration.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation's Borders (\"The Border Czar\"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The term \"czar\" is shorthand for a high-level executive branch official in charge of a specific policy focus.",
      "They aren't Senate-confirmed positions",
      "The \"czar\" role is one that allows a president to step over the pesky checks and balances of the three branches of government. \"Czar\" roles aren't Senate-confirmed cabinet positions, like say, the secretary of state or Health and Human Services secretary. That means a president can appoint that person to his administration without the Senate's input, and quickly.",
      "Trump wants to put his people in place, and quickly, after experiencing in his first term how congressional authority can gum up an administration's plans. Trump said as much in a social media post on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more,\" Trump wrote Sunday, saying he wants recess appointments. \"This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Trump wouldn't be the first president to use \"czars\"",
      "Trump would not be the first president to use \"czars.\" Such czars have been appointed by presidents of both parties. Former President Barack Obama had, in part, an \"energy and environment czar,\" \"Afghanistan czar,\" \"car czar,\" \"health czar\" and \"auto recovery czar.\"",
      "His use of these positions was so widespread that in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the history and legality of executive branch czars. The committee noted that some of these policy czars were at one point confirmed by the Senate, while others were in positions outside the White House that reported to a Senate-confirmed officer. But a handful worked in the White House. The use of such \"czars\" ignited a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, and even some Democrats raised concerns about their authority.",
      "But presidents before Obama had \"czars,\" too. President Bill Clinton had a \"Y2K czar,\" and President George W. Bush had an \"AIDS czar,\" \"counterterrorism czar\" and \"reading czar,\" among others. Historians believe the role dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who rapidly expanded the size and role of the federal government.",
      "Trump also had something of a \"czar\" in his first term. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive, oversaw Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's initiative to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the Obama administration, Republicans blasted the growth of the administrative state, and decisions made by unelected bureaucrats. And during the Trump administration, Trump supporters bemoaned the so-called \"deep state\" of unelected career officers.",
      "Vice President Harris was sometimes dubbed a \"border czar,\" although not by President Biden himself, since the president tasked her with tackling the influx of migrants at the southern border. Harris fought against that label as the Democratic nominee.",
      "A \"czar\" position could make room for controversial names like RFK, Jr.",
      "The Senate will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office. But Trump still may have trouble confirming a few of the most controversial names, like vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to Senate-confirmed Cabinet positions.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0is on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the\u00a0president-elect's\u00a0campaign said. But it's also possible Kennedy could serve in a less formal role, like a \"czar.\"",
      "Where did the concept of \"czars\" originate?",
      "\"Czar\" comes from the Russian word \"tsar,\" which is derived from the Latin word \"caesar,\" according to World History Encyclopedia. Specifically, the term tsar refers to Russia's rulers for hundreds of years. Ivan IV The Terrible was formally crowned the \"tsar of all Russia\" in 1547, and the title continued until Russia's monarchy was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt, who greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government, used \"czars.\" But even before his time in office, the first use of the phrase \"czar\" in the U.S. was likely Nicholas Biddle, tapped to be president of the Bank of the United States during Andrew Jackson's presidency. He was sometimes called \"Czar Nicholas,\" which overlapped with Russia's Czar Nicholas I's reign.",
      "Over time, the term in U.S. came to be used informally for people handpicked by the president for principal positions who don't undergo Senate vetting, scrutiny or confirmation.",
      "What are the pros and cons of \"czars\"?",
      "Critics of such roles have argued \"czars\" run amock of the checks and balances system the forefathers founded. The late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd criticized both Obama and Bush for creating such roles in their administrations.",
      "\"The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances,\" Byrd wrote in a publicized letter to Obama in 2009. \"At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\"",
      "The president can, of course, appoint White House employees. The constitutional issues come into question when the president selects a principal who isn't Senate-confirmed.",
      "But for a president looking to appoint an ally quickly, a \"czar\" is logistically much easier to get into office than is a Cabinet secretary.",
      "How effective a \"czar\" can really be is up for debate \u2014 especially since \"czars\" generally don't control budgets.",

      "Waves of U.S. Capitol riot defendants are citing Donald Trump's election in requests to delay their criminal prosecutions because of his public pledge to pardon some of the people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys asked federal judges in Washington, D.C., to postpone proceedings in some of the Jan. 6 cases until 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The filings complicate the Justice Department's ability to conclude its prosecutions \u2014 hundreds of which remain active \u2014 before the changeover in power.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant from Kansas, has filed a new request for a delay, blistering the Justice Department for continuing apace with his prosecution.\u00a0Pope's filing cited Trump's reelection, arguing, \"Any further action in these cases is not an 'administration of justice' in the public interest as the government claims, but a belligerent disregard for the will of the American people, from which all law and governmental power in this country is derived.\"",
      "In a new request to delay his sentencing, defendant Terry Allen's attorneys filed a motion saying, \"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says.\" Allen's attorneys noted that in Trump's first term, he \"pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 237 people,\" and \"[m]any were controversial.\"",
      "Some defendants are quoting Trump's campaign statements in their new court filings. Attorneys for defendant Larry Brock argued that Trump \"explicitly campaigned on justice for the January 6 defendants.\" They cited Trump's July 31 interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he said he'd \"'absolutely' pardon those convicted in the January 6th prosecutions because 'they were convicted by a very tough system.'\" They also quoted Trump's claim about Jan. 6 convicts: \"'[S]ome call them prisoners. I call them hostages...release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release them, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe.'\"",
      "Brock, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, was accused of rifling through papers on the desks of senators while amid the mob.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph McBride, who has defended several Jan. 6 criminal defendants told CBS News that requests would be made \"across the board\" to delay cases until Trump takes office. \"It would be foolish not to,\" he said. \"The Justice Department Is still arresting people, which is nuts and pointless. The pardon thing is looming. And I don't think any of these prosecutions will continue beyond (Trump taking office).\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Scott Fredericksen told CBS News he thinks the Justice Department is going to be forced to confront the question of what to do with the cases.",
      "\"The department will probably say, 'We're going to continue with the cases,' and that the discussion of pardons is not sufficient to warrant delays,\" Fredricksen said.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately return requests for comment. In court filings, it has opposed requests for delays. In the case of Terry Allen, prosecutors disagreed that a continuance of the case was warranted because \"the defendant's justification at this time is mere speculation.\"",
      "\"The Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution,\" prosecutors argued. \"Courts in this jurisdiction have denied similar motions.\"",
      "Opposing a request to delay the trial of defendant Stephen Baker, the Justice Department argued, \"There is a public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. The government and the Court have endeavored to deliver that interest. The government disagrees that a continuance is warranted here, and the Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution.\"",
      "But the numbers of delay requests are expected to grow significantly. McBride, the New York-based defense attorney, told CBS News requests are expected by all similarly situated defendants. He said defense attorneys must argue for all of their clients and may not \"pick and choose\" to ask for delays only for some.",
      "In his court filing, Pope included a photo of himself standing next to Trump.",
      "\"It is now up to the Court to decide if it wishes to expend judicial resources by enduring a taxing schedule in this case,\" the filing said. \"Ultimately, I will get the same result with a trial or with no trial.\"",
      "The Justice Department has launched over 1,500 criminal cases in its prosecution of the Capitol siege.\u00a0 According to federal records, approximately 950 defendants have pleaded guilty, and 200 more have been found guilty at trial.",
      "Arrests continue, including new cases unsealed over the past few weeks.",
      "Fredericksen said a Trump-appointed attorney general could move to have the department dismiss pending Jan. 6 cases \u2014 and could opt to reopen and dismiss cases against those who have already been convicted and sentenced to prison.",

      "\"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" the president-elect said.",
      "The Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause grants presidents the ability to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" The maneuver is considered to be a way to make swift appointments during the Senate's absence, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, which notes that recess appointments have also been used for political reasons \u2014 for instance, to make an appointment on a temporary basis for an individual who would not be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "With a GOP majority of at least 52 seats, Trump shouldn't have too much difficulty getting his nominations through the chamber through the regular process. But pushback from a handful of Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana or Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah could imperil some of his more controversial picks. The process could also be delayed by Democrats in the minority, who could rely on procedural maneuvers to extend the time it takes for Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed.",
      "But the recess appointment maneuver is a controversial one that both parties have combated in recent years. Recess appointments are allowed only when the Senate is out of session for 10 days. For the last decade, both chambers have headed off recess appointments by going into pro-forma sessions even when lawmakers are in recess. And a Supreme Court decision in 2014 gave the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver, after controversial recess appointments by President Barack Obama.",
      "If Trump were to make an appointment during a recess in the first session of the new Congress, the appointment could last for almost two years, after which the individual could be appointed again through a recess appointment or the regular process, according to the CRS report. But without the Senate's approval, the appointee would not be paid.",
      "Should Republicans force a change to procedure in the upper chamber, they would do so with the risk that Democrats will take the same steps in their favor when they regain the majority. Still, all three candidates for GOP leader threw their support behind Trump's demand for recess appointments on Sunday.",
      "The candidates for Senate majority leader",
      "Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn increased attention to the race.",
      "Thune, 63, is currently the No. 2 Republican and considered by some to be the favorite in the race. He's been in the Senate since 2004 and served as GOP whip since 2021. But he hasn't always had a strong relationship with Trump, and initially backed Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina for president in the GOP primaries.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has been in the Senate since 2002 and previously served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019. His fundraising chops have made him a top candidate in the Senate leadership race. But like Thune, he's previously distanced himself from Trump \u2014 a gap both senators have sought to close in recent months.",
      "Meanwhile, Scott has been angling for the position. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role after the midterm elections in 2022, when he earned the support of just 10 members of his conference. Scott is similarly expected to find support from some of the conference's conservative members in this year's contest, and the outside endorsements from those who claim Cornyn and Thune are too close to McConnell could be a boon.",
      "Electing the \"next generation of leadership\"",
      "The leadership election comes after McConnell's decision to step away after 17 years at the helm, becoming the longest serving Senate leader in history.",
      "McConnell's decision to step aside and welcome \"the next generation of leadership\" teed up a high-stakes race for leader that has been shaking out behind the scenes since February. After Republicans flipped the Senate, the leadership race took on even greater importance.",
      "\"I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor the majority,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference last week. \"I've been the majority leader, I've been the minority leader \u2013 majority's a lot better.\"",
      "Outside influence and endorsements",
      "The race, nine months in the making, has begun to draw input from outsiders in recent days. Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are among the Trump loyalists who have weighed in to back Scott, urging that he is best suited to carry out the president-elect's agenda.",
      "How the input from prominent outsiders weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors to elect the new leader, casting secret ballots, which make senators less likely to be swayed by external pressures.",
      "For months, the three candidates have been working behind the scenes to persuade their colleagues to back them for the chamber's top post. And so far, just a small portion of the Republican conference has shared publicly who they plan to support.",
      "Thune has the backing of Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, along with Steve Daines of Montana, who chaired the GOP campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, this cycle and may have valuable sway with new members whose races he buoyed. Meanwhile, Cornyn has the support of Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. And Scott has the backing of Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. In recent days, he also earned endorsements from Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee \u2014 two senators who have been floated as possible picks for Trump's cabinet.",
      "The bulk of the conference has yet to weigh in publicly, and likely won't be swayed by outsiders on a decision that will guide how the chamber operates for the next two years. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself, who will work with the leader going forward, could change the dynamic.",
      "Whether Trump endorses a particular candidate remains to be seen. Thune acknowledged on CNBC last week that Trump can \"exert a considerable amount of influence\" on the leadership race, but he cautioned him against doing so, saying, \"I think my preference would be, and I think it's in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "\"He's got to work with all of us when it's all said and done,\" Thune said. \"But whatever he decides to do, that's going to be his prerogative, as we know.\"",

    "summary": "Seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",
      "Macquarie University Professor Nathan Hart, one of the study's authors, said the lights caused a \"complex interaction\" with the shark's behavior.",
      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",
      "The study's authors released a video showing some of the research in action.",
      "Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.",
      "Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.",
      "Ryan said her research could allow less invasive mitigation methods to be used.",
      "More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks -- which have different predatory behavior \u2014 responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.",
      "There have been more than 1,200 shark incidents in Australia since 1791, of which 255 resulted in death, official data shows.",
      "Great white sharks were responsible for 94 of those deaths.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",

      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",

      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tomson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tomson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tomson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that would have required public schools statewide to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms by Jan. 1. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles of Baton Rouge, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled Tuesday that the law violates the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.",
      "The ruling found the Louisiana law was \"unconstitutional on its face and in every application,\" prohibited Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and defendants in this case from enforcing the mandate, and required them to notify public schools of the change. Tuesday's decision came alongside a preliminary injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by parents of Louisiana public school students, who are represented by a legal team from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",
      "Defendants include Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, along with members of the state education board and other local school boards, all of whom the attorney general represents.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican whose push to integrate elements of his own Christian faith into secular life has been central to his political platform, signed the Ten Commandments legislation into law in June. Referred to as HB 71 in the ongoing lawsuit, it ordered all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities in Louisiana to display a poster-sized printout of the commandments \u2014 a set of moral directives essentially meant to lay the foundation of certain religious sects, including the Christian church \u2014 in \"large, easily readable font\" starting next year.",
      "Proponents of the law argued it would reinstate a former relic of \"state and national history, culture, and tradition\" in Louisiana's public education spaces and claimed the measure was not only rooted in religion. But those who opposed the legislation raised questions about its constitutionality.",
      "In an original complaint challenging the Ten Commandments law, the ACLU claimed it amounted to a violation of church and state and would effectively discriminate against students, particularly students who are not Christian. Their lawsuit sought a court order declaring HB 71 infringed on the constitutional religious rights laid out by the First Amendment, which forbids the government from \"establishing\" a religion, or favoring one religion over others, and protects the religious liberties of individual citizens.",
      "\"The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,\" read the original complaint. \"The law's primary sponsor and author, Representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'\"",
      "The ACLU said in a statement its lawsuit represented a group of plaintiffs \"who are Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious.\" Each felt \"the newly enacted statute violates longstanding U.S. Supreme Court precedent\" along with the U.S. Constitution, the statement added.",

    "story": [
      "As Democrats work to sort out last week's election results and determine why they lost Latino men in droves, a Latino Democrat and senator-elect has some advice for party leaders and top consultants: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
      "CBS News Tuesday projected Gallego as the victor in Arizona's U.S. Senate contest against Republican Kari Lake. He believes much of his party is out of touch with a key demographic he says they can't win national elections without.",
      "\"There is no winning nationally without Latinos,\" Gallego said in an extensive interview with CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe Tuesday. \"...There's no path forward into the Democratic Party, into a national party, without Latinos.\"",
      "Exit polls show Vice President Kamala Harris lost Latino men to President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 a significant blow to a party that's long relied on them as part of a broad coalition. The results were openly feared most of the past year by Democratic Party leaders and operatives.",
      "Going forward, Gallego said candidates need to go out and find Latinos where they already are. Gallego focused on bringing his campaign to Latino voters \u2014 sometimes, without talking about politics at all. His campaign hosted rodeos, boxing match watch parties, and carne asada cookouts. His team took food to construction shift workers at work sites after they'd clocked out in the early morning. Knocking on people's doors, after shift workers are exhausted and preparing for the next day, won't work, he said.",
      "\"Talk to them. And talk to them as often as possible,\" Gallego said. \"And don't expect you to be able to talk to them one way through TV.\"",
      "There are \"millions and millions\" of Latino men out there, Gallego said, and they're not afraid to speak their mind.",
      "Democrats on the national stage also missed the mark in how they spoke about immigration. Gallego's first Spanish-language TV ad was about border security. Latinos in Arizona looked at the migration crisis at the border, with refugees pouring into the country, and called it \"chaos,\" Gallego said.",
      "While campaigning, \"We didn't actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesn't believe it anymore,\" Gallego said, meaning, Latino voters don't believe Washington will actually pass a massive immigration reform bill in the near future.",
      "Instead, Congress needs to focus on fortifying U.S.-Mexico border security first to build trust, he said.",
      "But that message, O'Keefe suggested, may be a hard pill to swallow for fellow Democrats.",
      "\"I'm a pharmacist about to give out very hard pills in the Senate,\" Gallego said.",
      "Gallego also hinted that Democrats missed the mark on addressing inflation. Born on the south side of Chicago to a Colombian mother and a Mexican father, with his mother raising four children alone, Gallego said he knows what it's like to grow up struggling. He saw the flashing warning signs on inflation, not just in the polls, but as he talked with his working-class family members and constituents.",
      "\"Growing up working class, there's nothing more hurtful than working hard and then not being able to provide for your family,\" Gallego said. \"And I instinctively knew that's what these men were going through.\"",
      "\"This is the first time I've ever seen men say I can't do this,\" Gallego said. \"I can't keep working, and it's still not making a difference, and that's when I realized it was really kind of a problem.\"",
      "Raised by his mother, Gallego became a U.S. Marine and served in the Iraq war. He moved to Arizona for a local political job, ran and won a seat in the state House before winning his first congressional race in 2014, representing most of Phoenix and Glendale.",
      "He began on Capitol Hill with an outspoken progressive reputation and was among the Democrats calling on the U.S. Senate to abandon the filibuster. But Gallego has shifted his politics to the center in recent years, a reflection of the state's roughly three-way voter registration split between Democrats, Republicans and independents.",
      "He launched his Senate campaign nearly two years ago, focusing early advertising and outreach on his military service, a key credential in a state with a hefty military and veteran population and a history of electing military veterans, including the late Republican Sen. John McCain, to Congress. With nominal Democratic primary opposition and polls giving him an early lead, independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced in March she would not run for reelection, avoiding a three-way contest.",
      "Until Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of McCain's term after his death.",
      "In his race, Gallego wasn't about to give up on Trump voters \u2014 or any voters, he said.",
      "A rising star in the party \u2014 a veteran and Latino who was victorious in a state Trump won \u2014 Gallego brushed off questions about a future bid for president.",
      "\"Can I rule out running? I can \u2014 I can rule out a lot of things,\" Gallego said. \"First thing I want to focus on is this U.S. Senate race.\"",
      "\"That's not a no,\" O'Keefe pointed out.",
      "\"It's not a yes, either,\" Gallego said, adding a Spanish word for patience: \"C\u00e1lmate.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:42:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Emergency birth control sales and appointments for IUDs spiked after Election Day over fears of what a Trump presidency could mean for women's reproductive rights.",
    "story": [
      "Online retailers and birth control providers have seen a spike in sales for emergency contraceptives since Donald Trump was elected for a second term as president of the United States.",
      "Winx Health, a sexual health company formerly known as Stix, reported a reported a 966% increase in sales of their morning-after pill, Restart, in the 60 hours after the election compared\u00a0 with the week prior.",
      "Wisp, a sexual and reproductive telehealth company, similarly reported a 1000% increase in sales for emergency contraception from Nov. 5-6, especially in states with abortion bans. Texas, Alabama and Indiana were the top three states with new patients purchasing emergency contraceptives on those dates, Monica Cepak, CEO of Wisp, said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We saw a similar situation unfold when\u00a0Roe v. Wade was overturned and are not surprised that women are once again taking their healthcare into their own hands by stockpiling these medications,\" Cepak said.",
      "Appointments and searches for long-acting reversible birth control methods also surged following the election.",
      "Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that provides sexual and reproductive health services and information, reported appointments for intrauterine devices, or IUDs, increased by 760% on Nov. 6. Appointments for birth control implants increased 350% compared with the previous day and vasectomy appointments increased by 1200%, the organization said.",
      "\"Americans may be rightfully feeling fearful and worried about the prospect of further restrictions on our freedom to control our bodies. Waking up on November 6, they rushed to Planned Parenthood for help,\" Danika Severino Wynn, vice president of care and access for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said.",
      "Wynn said Planned Parenthood tracked similar trends in 2022 following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, as well as after the 2016 presidential election. According to a 2019 study published\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicine, the daily rate of insertions of long-acting reversible contraceptives increased more than 21% in the 30 days after Trump's win in 2016, compared with the 30 days before.",
      "Trump has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution generally protected the right of women to have an abortion before the point of viability. In an interview with CBS News in August, Trump said he had \"no regrets\" over his Supreme Court picks that led to the reversal. During Trump's first term, his administration also restricted the availability of funding for contraception, leaving many worried about what a second term could bring.",
      "His stance on other reproductive rights issues has wavered. In a May interview, Trump was asked if he supports any restrictions on a person's right to contraceptives, to which he responded, \"We're looking at that.\" He later retracted this by saying on Truth Social he has \"NEVER, AND WILL NEVER ADVOCATE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON BIRTH CONTROL, or other contraceptives.\" The inconsistency left some questioning what his exact plan would be when he takes up his second term.",
      "Dr. Elise Berlan, a faculty physician at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said her advice for people who are worried is to talk to a trusted professional.",
      "\"My advice would be the same right now as it's been for a while that the best conversation to have is with a healthcare provider to really understand what a person's options are and what's going to be the best for them in a really person-centered way.\"",

      "Kraft Heinz is pulling Lunchables \u2014 prepackaged boxes of deli meat, cheese and crackers \u2014 from the program that provides free and discounted meals to about 30 million low-income school children, the food conglomerate said on Tuesday.",
      "Consumer Reports applauded the move, months after the advocacy group sounded alarms about the product popular with kids, saying its tests found troubling levels of lead and sodium in them.",
      "\"Lunchables and other lunch kits with concerning levels of sodium and harmful chemicals have no place on the school lunch menu,\" Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, stated on Tuesday. \"We're pleased that Heinz Kraft has pulled Lunchables from the school lunch program after lower than expected demand from school districts across the country.\"",
      "In an Oct. 30 earnings call, Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera called Lunchables a \"very important\" part of the company's business, while noting what he described as \"misleading\" negative publicity regarding the product.",
      "Kraft Heinz changed two of its Lunchables \u2014 Turkey & Cheddar Cracker Stackers and Extra Cheesy Pizza Lunchables \u2014 to qualify for the USDA-run program. Sales of those two products were less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales, so the business impact is negligible, according to the company.",
      "In a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch, Kraft Heinz said demand for Lunchables from school districts across the country did not meet its targets. \"Lunchables products are not available in schools this year, and we hope to revisit at a future date,\" the company said.",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he has selected former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Israel.",
      "\"Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\"",
      "The post requires approval by the Senate, though Huckabee is unlikely to face major obstacles to confirmation in the upper chamber, where Republicans are expected to hold at least 52 seats in the next Congress.",
      "Huckabee is among the early picks announced by the president-elect as he begins building out his Cabinet and other key posts. Among those are Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Rep. Michael Waltz as national security adviser. Sources say he is expected to tap Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, though the selection is not finalized.",
      "Huckabee served as Arkansas' governor from 1996 to 2007 and unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016. After leaving office, he hosted a show on Fox News and a radio program. He is a staunch defender of Israel and has said he has visited the country more than 100 times over the course of 50 years.",
      "During his first term, Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during his first term, which President Biden maintained.",
      "If confirmed next year, Huckabee will take over the post amid Isreal's war with Hamas and Hamas' holding of dozens of Israeli hostages, including four American citizens. Discussions about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly stalled, and on Saturday, Qatar, a mediator with Hamas, announced it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when \"the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\"",

More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, though it is unclear how many are civilians and how many are militants.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "summary": "Americans have struggled with high grocery costs since inflation soared during the pandemic. Now prices are falling.",
    "story": [
      "Grocery prices continue to eat a hole in household budgets, with many Americans citing the economy and inflation as top issues\u00a0behind their votes in the November 5 election. But there are signs that consumers may soon get a break on their grocery bills, with some food prices falling in October from a year earlier \u2014 the first decline in four years.",
      "Online grocery prices dipped 0.1% in October from a year \u2014 that marks the first dip since January 2020, before the pandemic shuttered the U.S. economy and sent inflation soaring, according to new\u00a0data from Adobe's Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI), which tracks online prices.",
      "Online grocery prices represent what consumers pay when they order food from retailers such as Walmart, Whole Foods and others through apps or websites.",
      "To be sure, online grocery shopping represents only a portion of Americans' overall food purchases, with about 20% of U.S. shoppers buying their provisions through an app or website in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But the October price decline signasl that shoppers could get more relief ahead in the grocery aisles, with a Credit Karma survey in May\u00a0finding that about one-quarter of Americans had skipped a meal due to food costs.",
      "Grocery inflation more broadly has also cooled after hitting a pandemic-era peak of 13.5% in August 2022. In September, the cost of food that consume at home rose 1.3%, below the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate. And grocery prices may remain relatively flat in 2025, with the USDA projecting that food-at-home costs will increase only 1.6% next year.",
      "More broadly, online prices across all product categories dropped 2.9% in October from a year earlier, Adobe said. The decline was led by drops in prices for clothing and toys, which fell about 10% and 4%, respectively.",
      "What to expect in the next CPI report",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction lives on, at least for another week.",
      "A New York judge on Tuesday deferred making an immediate decision on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring \u2014 and if the verdict should be tossed.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan said he will rule next week on whether a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts precludes a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan did not directly address sentencing, which had been scheduled for Nov. 26.",
      "A prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg emailed Merchan Sunday night, saying Trump asked for a pause \"based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.\"",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" wrote the prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, who added there's a need to balance the interests of \"a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and the Office of the President.\"",
      "Trump lawyer Emil Bove followed up in his own email to Merchan, writing that a \"stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "The long-awaited ruling, on whether evidence shown at trial should have been shielded from jurors, due to presidential immunity, could have profound consequences for the case.",
      "Trump was the first former president ever to be convicted of crimes. On Nov. 5, he also became the first person with a criminal record ever to be elected president.",
      "Trump's lawyers vowed the day a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. They were given an extraordinary opportunity not long after when the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The decision said evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's legal team, which is led by Todd Blanche, seized on the landmark ruling, demanding Trump's conviction be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They argued jurors should never have heard testimony related to Trump's communications with former White House communications director Hope Hicks, or his former executive assistant and director of White House Operations Madeleine Westerhout.",
      "Prosecutors argued in response that the Supreme Court ruling didn't apply to evidence shown at trial. They also said the material protested by Trump's lawyers were \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered.",
      "The jury ultimately concluded that Trump committed 34 felonies in signing off on a scheme to cover-up reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen had paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years early. The agreement has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision in July was the latest curveball in a case that dates back to 2018, when the Manhattan District Attorney's office first began investigating the \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump, amid his first term as president, fought the investigation as it expanded into a wide-ranging probe of his finances. The case's first landmark Supreme Court ruling came in 2020, when the nation's highest court ruled the Constitution does not preclude a state criminal subpoena of a sitting president. The ruling allowed the Manhattan District Attorney, then Cyrus Vance Jr., access to Trump's tax returns.",
      "The borough's next district attorney, Alvin Bragg, took up the case but narrowed its focus, bringing it back to the \"hush money\" deal. On March 31, 2023, a grand jury made Trump the first ever former, and future, president indicted for crimes.",
      "Trump's seven-week trial began just more than a year later, on April 15. The jury returned his conviction after a day and a half of deliberations.",
      "Trump, sullen but defiant, walked out of the courtroom and in front of cameras just steps away immediately returned to his campaign for the presidency.",

The body was removed, and the next morning, a citizen reported seeing the dog sitting in the same spot it had been.",
      "Officials took custody of the dog, which they later learned was named Titan. They found the canine had a microchip and were able to identify it as having belonged to Reynolds. This led police to suspect Reynolds was the person whose body had been found. They went to her home and found it completely empty, with all her possessions, including her car, missing.",
      "Two days later, a man was spotted driving Reynolds' car near Wichita, Kansas. Police attempted to pull the driver over, but he started a high-speed chase, reaching speeds of over 100 miles per hour before crashing into another vehicle. The driver then fled on foot, running into a grocery store and hiding behind canned goods. He was quickly found by police and taken into custody. A .380 handgun was found inside the car.",
      "The driver was identified as Derek Daigneault, 29, a cousin of Reynolds'. Police began to investigate his movements between the discovery of Reynolds' body and the car chase. Security footage from an area Wal-Mart showed Daigneault purchasing a storage container that matched the one Reynolds' body was found burning in. He had also purchased a shovel and a gas can in the same visit.",
      "Video showed Daigneault driving away from the store in Reynolds' car, officials said. In the footage, Titan can be seen sticking his head out the window of the vehicle. He also had Reynolds' phone, which police used to track his location.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his state prosecution to federal court in the case stemming from an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "The court's denial of Meadows' appeal leaves in place a lower court decision that returned the prosecution to state court. Meadows and President-elect Donald Trump, for whom he worked, were charged alongside 17 others by Fulton County prosecutors for their alleged efforts to reverse Trump's electoral loss in Georgia in 2020.",
      "They pleaded not guilty to all charges. Proceedings have been on hold for months as a Georgia appeals court is set to consider in December whether to allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies.",
      "Meadows served as Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021 and was a prominent figure in the president-elect's attempts to stay in office for a consecutive term after the November 2020 presidential election.",
      "Two counts were brought against him by Fulton County prosecutors: the first alleges that he engaged in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy with Trump, and the second alleges he participated in an effort to solicit a public officer, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to violate his oath of office.",
      "Meadows is portrayed in the indictment returned in August 2023 as a go-between for Trump and others involved in coordinating the strategy for contesting the 2020 election and disrupting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. He participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes, enough to make him the winner of Georgia's election.",
      "After Meadows was charged, he sought to transfer the case to federal court under a federal officer removal statute and argued that the actions alleged in the indictment related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "The district court, however, sent the case back to the Fulton County Superior Court. While U.S. District Judge Steve Jones conceded that some of the charged conduct involved Meadows' official duties, there was not enough evidence to establish that a \"heavy majority\" of the acts alleged against him related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "\"Meadows's alleged association with post-election activities was not related to his role as White House Chief of Staff or his executive branch authority,\" Jones wrote in his September 2023 decision.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the district court's decision, finding that the federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and \"his participation in an alleged conspiracy to overturn a presidential election was not related to his official duties.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as his nominee for Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, two sources familiar with the transition discussions confirm to CBS News.",
      "The 52-year-old second-term governor, if confirmed, would have one of the most powerful jobs in Washington, controlling a $62 billion discretionary budget (plus $23 billion for disaster response and recovery) and roughly 260,000 employees. DHS is the third largest department in the U.S. government, behind the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The sprawling department includes the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration, among others.",
      "As governor, Noem has sent several deployments of South Dakota's National Guard troops to reinforce the southern border since 2021, writing in a statement during the last, in 2024, \"the border is a warzone, so we're sending soldiers.\"",
      "Trump has already appointed two immigration hardliners to the incoming administration: Tom Homan, his former Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, will serve as \"border czar and senior adviser Stephen Miller will be deputy chief of staff for policy.",
      "CNN first reported the development, which comes as Trump makes a slew of announcements for nominations for top roles in his incoming administration. Noem, a Republican governor, had been among a list of possible running mates for Trump earlier this year. But questions swirled about her political future after she detailed in her new book a story about killing her dog decades ago, sparking intense criticism, as well as claims that appeared to be false about meeting Kim Jong Un.",
      "Noem gained national attention following a refusal to employ a mask mandate policy in the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. When she took office in 2019, she became the first woman to serve as governor of South Dakota.",
      "The president-elect has announced a number of nominees and appointments since winning a decisive victory in the 2024 election last week.",
      "On Friday, Noem criticized Democratic governors who have pledged to resist President-elect Trump's immigration policies, calling the move by politicians like California Governor Gavin Newsom \"extremely irresponsible.\"",
      "\"If I had a new president in the White House, and even if he wasn't from my political party, the first thing I would do would be call him up and see if I could get a meeting,\" Noem said on NewsNation.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers are returning to Washington Tuesday for a lame duck session after Republicans flipped the Senate and appear poised to hold onto control of the House after last week's elections.",
      "The new Congress will be seated in January, and President-elect Donald Trump's agenda is expected to be its central focus. Until then, Senate Democrats may make a push to approve their priorities with their remaining days in control of the upper chamber.",
      "Lawmakers are also facing deadlines on other must-pass legislation, including funding the government, as they lay the groundwork for the new Congress with new-member orientation and leadership elections this week and next.",
      "The new Congress",
      "House Republicans reveled in their victories last week, expressing confidence that they would retain control of the lower chamber in the new year with just a handful of seats to go. Speaker Mike Johnson wrote a letter to colleagues asking for their continued support for his leadership, now that the election has delivered a \"mandate\" for a unified Republican government.",
      "\"If we meet this historic moment together, the next two years can result in the most consequential Congress of the modern era,\" Johnson continued, noting that \"to truly make America great again, we will need to begin delivering for the people on day one.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats continued to hold onto some hopes of flipping the House, to be the only check on Republican political power in Washington. Still, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who leads the Progressive Caucus, acknowledged Monday that Democrats have a \"very slim path to the majority.\"",
      "\"We are going to do our work to help rebuild and to come back from this loss and recalibrate,\" Jayapal said at a news conference to introduce the newly elected progressives.",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised the quality of Republican candidates in Senate races this cycle, saying the day after the election that he's \"never seen a better performance.\" With the new majority of at least 52 seats, the outgoing leader argued that Republicans did \"pretty well\" with narrow majorities during the last administration, citing three new Supreme Court justices and tax reform.",
      "\"It's harder, but I think we were successful before with a narrow majority and I think we will be again,\" McConnell said.",
      "Republicans to hold leadership elections",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will vote Wednesday to elect a new leader, since McConnell announced he would step aside earlier this year. A high-stakes race to replace the longest-serving leader in the chamber's history has been taking place behind the scenes.",
      "GOP Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn more attention to the race.",
      "How the outside input weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors and cast secret ballots to elect a new leader, making them less likely to be swayed by outside pressures. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself could change the dynamic. He has already weighed in with a demand about recess appointments.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans are also set to conduct leadership elections this week. With a stronger-than-expected showing across the House races, the current leadership slate is expected to enjoy widespread support to remain at the helm of the chamber. But Trump's selection of GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik to serve as ambassador to the U.N. created another opening in the leadership races.",
      "Lame duck to-do list: funding government, Biden's judicial nominations",
      "Congress is returning to pressure to avert a government shutdown after lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20 earlier this year.",
      "The pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown is commonplace for Congress, though it frustrates some House Republicans looking to avoid a vote on a massive spending bill known as an \"omnibus.\" Johnson said in September that he opposes an omnibus funding package around the holidays, suggesting that he would work to approve the12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the new balance of power in Washington next year almost certainly changes the calculus.",
      "House Republicans have so far approved a handful of the full-year spending bills, although they've done so on a partisan basis that makes them nonstarters in the Senate. And the upper chamber has yet to vote on any individual spending bills this year. The reality makes another stopgap measure punting a broader funding fight into the new year likely.",
      "Lawmakers may also address funding for disaster relief following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the southeastern U.S. earlier this year. And an annual defense policy bill is also a top priority before the year's end.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are expected to vote on judicial nominations, as President Biden has sought to match or even surpass the total number of judicial confirmations in Trump's first term. The issue takes on heightened importance for Democrats with another Trump term on the horizon.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, head of the Anglican Church, resigned Tuesday after a review found that he and other senior church leaders had covered up the \"prolific and abhorrent\" abuse of over 100 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and other countries by a British lawyer who helped lead Christian summer camps in the U.K. and other countries.",
      "John Smyth was accused of attacking boys and young men he met at Christian camps in the 1970s and 1980s. He died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77 without ever facing any legal proceedings.",
      "\"The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,\" Welby said in a statement announcing his resignation. \"For nearly twelve years I have struggled to introduce improvements. It is for others to judge what has been done.\"",
      "An independent Church of England review into the handling of complaints against Smyth found last week that, \"despite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup,\" the leader of the review said.",
      "\"I am so sorry that in places where these young men, and boys, should have felt safe and where they should have experienced God's love for them, they were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual abuse,\" Welby said in an initial statement responding to the review's findings. \"I am sorry that concealment by many people who were fully aware of the abuse over many years meant that John Smyth was able to abuse overseas and died before he ever faced justice.\"",
      "Welby has said he was unaware of Smyth's abuse until 2013, the year he became the archbishop.",
      "\"Nevertheless the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated,\" Welby said. \"Since that time the way in which the Church of England engages with victims and survivors has changed beyond recognition. Checks and balances introduced seek to ensure that the same could not happen today.\"",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior figure in the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church. The U.S.-based Episcopal Church, which has 1.6 million members, is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion and there are over 7,000 Episcopal churches across the U.S.",
      "Welby has played a central role in many high-profile events, including officiating the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and delivering the sermon at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "\"I think, rightly, people are asking the question: 'Can we really trust the Church of England to keep us safe?' And I think the answer at the moment is 'no,'\" Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley told CBS News' partner network BBC News, calling on Welby to resign.",
      "Andrew Morse, who told the BBC he was abused for years by Smyth as a teenager, had also called for Welby to resign. He said Welby's \"admission that in 2013, which is really modern day in comparison to the 1970s and 1980s, that he didn't do enough, that he wasn't rigorous\u2026 is enough in my mind to confirm that Justin Welby, along with countless other Anglican churchmen, were part of a cover-up about the abuse.\"",
      "Morse said he was beaten several times by Smyth during his youth, and that further abuse could have been stopped if Welby had acted when he found out about Smyth's actions in 2013.",
      "\"It is those African lives and those African victims that are very much on my conscience \u2014 and I would hope on the archbishop's conscience too.\"",

    "story": [
      "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Russian lawmakers on Tuesday passed controversial legislation banning \"propaganda\" that urges people to opt against having children, the latest measure targeting what Moscow depicts as Western liberal ideas. Facing an ageing population and low birth rates, Moscow is seeking to reverse a demographic slump \u2014 accentuated by its ongoing full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 that threatens its economic future.",
      "Members of the Russian parliament's lower house, the Duma, voted unanimously in favor of the draft bill, which would apply to materials online, in media, advertising and in films that promote a \"rejection of childbearing.\"",
      "The bill targets \"destructive content\" that promotes a \"conscious\" rejection of having children.",
      "The bill's authors have said it will not be used as punishment for \"a personal choice or lifestyle\" but only for promoting such a lifestyle, although it is unclear how this would be differentiated in practice.",
      "Under the ban on \"child-free propaganda,\" violations would be punishable by fines up to 400,000 rubles (about $4,000) on individuals and up to 5 million rubles, or about $51,000, for businesses. The bill also includes a provision to deport foreigners found guilty of disseminating the banned information.",
      "\"This is a fateful law... Without children, there will be no country. This ideology will lead to people stopping giving birth to children,\" the Duma's speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said ahead of the vote.",
      "He also said the legislation was about \"protecting citizens, primarily the generation growing up, from information spread in the media space that negatively affects the development of personality.\"",
      "The effort was \"so new generations of our citizens grow up orientated towards traditional family values\", he said.",
      "Nina Ostanina, a Communist Party lawmaker who heads the Duma committee on family policy, said the bill aims to \"guard our youth from unnecessary ideologies.\"",
      "The legislation will now be considered by the upper house of parliament on November 20, before coming before President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to sign it into law.",
      "It comes on top of existing bans on \"propaganda\" of LGBTQ relationships or changing gender.",
      "The Duma also unanimously passed legislation Tuesday banning foreigners living in countries that allow gender reassignment from adopting Russian children. The bill is aimed at stopping Russian-born children being able to legally change their gender.",
      "Moscow has long portrayed itself as a bulwark against liberal values, but that trend has hugely accelerated since the Kremlin launched its Ukraine offensive, further rupturing ties with the West.",
      "The bill would ban adoption by citizens of countries that authorize \"the change of sex by medical intervention, including with the use of medicine,\" or allow individuals to change their gender on official identity documents.",
      "Since 1993, foreigners have adopted 102,403 children from Russia, Volodin said, warning that \"Western policy towards children is destructive.\"",
      "Russia previously banned all U.S. adoptions in 2012 with a bill named after a Russian toddler who died of heat stroke in 2008 after his adoptive American father forgot him in a car.",
      "Russia has created an inhospitable environment for LBGTQ people for years. In July 2023, it banned the \"international LGBT movement\" as extremist and made gender reassignment illegal.",
      "Putin himself has repeatedly mocked people who have undergone gender reassignment as well as LGBTQ people.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",

      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

      "The shipwreck was recently found by the Royal Australian Navy. The announcement of the discovery was made on November 11, which marked\u00a0Veteran's Day in the United States and Remembrance Day in other parts of the world.",
      "\"This is part of our continuing efforts to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice,\" said U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy in a statement announcing the discovery. \"We will now be able to preserve this important memorial and hope that the families of the heroes who died there will know their loved ones rest in peace. We will tell their stories, learn from their bravery, and be inspired by their sacrifice. We will always remember them.\"",
      "Little information was provided about how the ship was found. Royal Australian Navy Vice Admiral Mark Hammond said that his fleet used \"advanced robotic and autonomous systems, normally used for hydrographic survey capabilities, to locate USS Edsall on the seabed\" of the Indian Ocean. There were no details provided about what condition the ship was in, or how the wreck will be preserved.",
      "The announcement of the Edsall's discovery came just three days after U.K. military officials revealed that a shipwreck discovered off the coast of Scotland was confirmed to be a British cruiser sunk by a torpedo during World War I, killing more than 500 crew members on board.",

      "Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv's troops and had blamed Moscow for the war.",
      "A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia's Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor.",
      "Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her.",
      "Her defense argued that the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial.",
      "In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was \"painful\" to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down.",
      "\"A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child's psyche. Only a monster is capable of this \u2014 and of the words that I allegedly said to them,\" Mediazona quoted her as saying.",

    "summary": "1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led archeologists to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that was decisive in the spread of Islam in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",
      "In recent years, the digs have returned and thousands of stolen artifacts have been repatriated.",

      "On October 15, 1914, a German sub captained by U-boat ace Otto Weddigen attacked the HMS Hawke, killing 524 crew members, officials said. The ship exploded and sank in fewer than eight minutes with just 70 sailors surviving.",
      "The month before sinking HMS Hawke, the same U-boat sank three Royal Navy cruisers in one hour, killing more than 1,450 sailors and Royal Marines.",
      "HMS Hawke was located in August about six miles from where British maritime officials estimated it would be in the early 1970s. Divers found it about 360 feet underwater.",
      "The team consulted the war diary of the U-boat that sank Hawke, as well as the logs of the nearest warships to the cruiser at the time of its sinking, officials said. Divers also looked at contemporary charts of the North Sea to help pinpoint the possible wreck site.",
      "\"The wreck is in remarkable condition for a vessel of this era, likely due to the depth and having never been dived before,\" said Steve Mortimer, one of the divers. \"It's a fascinating site. You can look through the open scuttles and see artifacts just lying there on the deck. There's lots of Royal Navy crockery, including teacups, plates and bowls.

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:24:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join,\" says a researcher behind the analysis of satellite images and government documents.",
    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. China's navy is already the world's largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\" force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China's leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country's global image as a leading power.\"",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen's complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China's 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project's \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury's research.",
      "China's first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn't even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China's People's Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once - one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 - something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China's carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy's carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military's ability to 'intervene' in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country's rejuvenation.",
      "The country's most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world's largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China's shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China's rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \"growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China's shore,\" the report said.",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014 Early this fall in Gaza, aid workers doled out one food portion per mealtime, per family to starving civilians displaced by Israel's raging war with Hamas. But as Israel choked off aid deliveries to the Palestinian territory, the meals dwindled. Last week, the United Nations again warned that some Gazans are facing famine conditions.",
      "Israel's government faces a deadline this Wednesday. The Biden administration warned almost a month ago that Israel must significantly increase the amount of aid reaching Gaza's beleaguered civilian population within 30 days, or it would face restrictions on American military support to the country.",
      "The ultimatum, laid out in a letter from the administration to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his deputies, appears to have had some impact.",
      "CBS News saw aid trucks roll across the border from Israel into Gaza at one of the four land crossing points on Monday morning.",
      "Under U.S. pressure, Israel has increased the amount of aid from a low of just 30 aid trucks entering per day in October, to about 150 now. But that's still less than half of",
      "the 350 trucks the U.S. government said must be rolling into Gaza to meet the urgent needs of the enclave's 2 million-plus people.",
      "United Nations humanitarian agencies have said in recent days that far from a dramatic increase, even less food and other aid are reaching Palestinian civilians in Gaza due to ongoing Israeli restrictions and evacuation orders and ramped-up offensives in the north and center of the territory, along with chaos created by the lack of any law enforcement presence in the enclave.",
      "Netanyahu's newly appointed Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday he was confident that Israel would \"reach understanding with our American friends and that issue will be solved.\"",
      "But Michael Oren, a former Israeli Ambassador to the United States, told CBS News that if the outgoing Biden administration does determine the minimum aid threshold isn't being met and it decides to curb the flow of American military support, it could impact Israel's war effort.",
      "\"Israel has to ask itself, 'Do we have the ammunition we need to get to January 20th, 2025?'\u2026 I don't know. I served in the Army over the summer, up in the north, and there were some severe shortages back then.\"",
      "But while the vast material support from the U.S. may be crucial, Oren said there were broader implications for Israel should the U.S. government scale back its backing.",
      "\"It's a signal given to other suppliers,\" he said.",
      "In other words, if Israel's biggest ally reduces the extent of its support for the multifront war, it could prompt other nations that have continued backing the Israeli government despite major human rights concerns, including some that have already imposed some limits, to rein in their aid and diplomatic support, too.",
      "\"That signal from the United States \u2014 where you already have Canada and Great Britain withholding certain types of arms deliveries from us \u2014 the signal, saying that our primary ally in the world is not delivering these arms, [would be] a very, very dangerous signal,\" said Oren.",
      "Israel's President Isaac Herzog will be in Washington to meet with President Biden on Tuesday, and the provision of aid to Gaza is certain to be a key topic of discussion.",
      "But Netanyahu is also clearly aware that the White House is now set to change hands, and while its incoming resident, President-elect Donald Trump, has criticized the current Israeli government's tactics in communicating about the war, he's seen as less likely to keep up or increase the U.S. pressure over humanitarian concerns in Gaza.",

      "Forty-seven years later, Perigo got his ring back. The surprise reunion unfolded thanks to Alex Davis, a professional freediver who recently discovered the jewelry while using an underwater metal detector.

      "Tens of thousands of people gathered to ride bikes between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in central China after a social media post suggested a cheap night-time bike ride to get dumplings went viral. The crowds caused gridlock and prompted bike-sharing companies to lock down their services, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The idea for the event was sparked by four college students who took the same roughly 30-mile trip over the summer to get soup dumplings. It appears to have grown out of a trend that's seen young people struggling with China's difficult job market seek out inexpensive travel options.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on a popular tourist beach in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, according to a statement from the Western Australia state's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, Australia's neighbor almost entirely south of Denmark. It is believed to be the furthest north \u2014 and thus the furthest from their natural habitat \u2014 that a wild emperor penguin has ever been spotted.",
      "\"The furthest north they go from Antarctica is about 50 degrees south [latitude] from my readings and Ocean Beach is 35 degrees south,\" Cannell told Australia's national broadcaster ABC last week. \"So, a lot further north than what they've ever tracked\u00a0emperor\u00a0penguins from Antarctica before.\"",
      "Could the Arctic be ice-free within a decade?",
      "Could the Arctic be ice-free within a decade?",
      "Cannell said she had no idea why the penguin traveled to Australia's coast. She's advising seabird rehabilitator Carol Biddulph, who's caring for the penguin, spraying him with a chilled water mist to help him cope with his alien climate.",
      "The penguin is 39 inches tall and initially weighed 51 pounds. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The Western Australia biodiversity department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the animal. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that \"options are still being worked through.\"",
      "ABC said last week that the errant animal was first spotted by a local surfer from Denmark, Aaron Fowler, who told the network he and some friends were baffled when they first saw it coming out of the water.",
      "\"It stood up in the waves and just waddled straight up to us, an emperor penguin, he was probably about a meter high, and he was not shy at all,\" Fowler told ABC.",
      "\"There is always a bit of wildlife in the water but never a penguin,\" he said. \"He tried to do like, a slide on his on his belly, thinking it was snow I guess, and just face-planted in the sand and stood up and shook all the sand off.\"",
      "Emperor penguins are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",
      "The penguins breed and live on sea ice, but the\u00a0Antarctic Sea ice is disappearing\u00a0as our planet warms up.",
      "\"They show up at the breeding season and the ice isn't there, so they have nowhere to breed,\" Dr. Birgitte McDonald, an ecologist at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, which is funded and administered by San Jose State University, told CBS San Francisco last year.",

      "Scammers often ask for answers to secret questions for crucial information needed to access accounts.",
      "Phishing emails are one of the most common tricks scammers use, but they\u2019re usually easy to catch if you pay attention. Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",
      "According to the FBI, there\u2019s been a recent rise in cybercriminal services using hacked police and government email accounts to send fake subpoenas and data requests to U.S.-based tech companies.",

      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",

      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",
      "4) Verify suspicious requests:\u00a0If you get an unexpected email asking for sensitive info, contact the sender directly through an official channel to confirm the request.",

But now, since scammers can even access government emails, you need to be extra cautious. This phishing scam seems to target mostly big tech companies, so it\u2019s on them to strengthen their security and verify every request thoroughly before sharing any user information.

Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",

      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",

      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",

In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",

These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",

      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",

      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft?

A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data.

When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses OpenAI ending its safety task force, actress Scarlett Johansson claiming the company copied her voice and the growing popularity of the voice notes phone feature.",
      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly. You have control over ChatGPT\u2019s memory. You can reset it, clear specific memories or all memories, or turn this feature off entirely in your settings.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Johann\u00a0Rehberger\u2019s ChatGPT conversation. (Johann Rehberger)",
      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",
      "If you're not cool with ChatGPT keeping stuff about you or the chance that it could let a bad actor access your data, you can just turn off this feature in the settings.",
      "Open the\u00a0ChatGPT app or website\u00a0on your computer or smartphone.Click on the\u00a0profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.Go to Settings and then select Personalization.Switch the Memory option off, and you\u2019re all set.",

      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

    "story": [
      "SentinelOne's chief security adviser discusses the alarming rise in cyberattacks worldwide on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",
      "You might remember the\u00a0Ascension ransomware attack from May, one of the most devastating incidents in the health care sector, causing major issues for patients.",
      "A new report from Microsoft highlights that these attacks not only lead to data theft but also put patients' physical health at risk.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Woman working on a computer in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",
      "Mother, daughter and doctor walking in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "1. Stay informed: Keep up to date with the latest news from your health care providers and reliable sources to stay aware of any disruptions or data breaches affecting systems and services.",
      "2. Maintain personal health records: Keep copies of your health records on your own devices or printed out, including details like medications, allergies, past surgeries and other relevant health information. This can be crucial if electronic health records become temporarily unavailable.",
      "3. Prepare for medical emergencies: Have a backup plan for emergencies, including knowing nearby alternative health care facilities. Research wait times and accessibility to help avoid delays if your primary facility is impacted.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Practice cybersecurity best practices: Use strong, unique passwords for online accounts and consider a\u00a0password manager to help manage them. Enable two-factor authentication where available to add an extra layer of security.",
      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

      "\"It is one of those cases that just kind of stands out,\" licensed private investigator Steve Ridge told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Jodi was a young, vivacious anchor on television, very photogenic, very charismatic, and I think that even people that don't know her felt a certain attraction to her.

He said Huisentruit began her journalism career at a station not far from his home, and despite being such a public personality, she was very approachable to locals in her area.",
      "\"Mason City is such a small town, and Jodi was so accessible. I mean, she was everywhere\u2026she loved to go to the local pubs and enjoy herself and talk to people,\" Ridge explained. \"That's so different than most television anchors in most larger markets where there's, you know, there's a pretty big disconnect, really, between the individual you see on the air and their in-person, you know, facade\u2026 she was just an exception, and the town just adopted her and loved her.\"",

The IPC found in December 2023 that 17% of Gazans faced catastrophic phase-five hunger conditions. By March, 30% of the population had reached phase five, with onlookers predicting famine was imminent. The next report, however, found that just 15% of Gazans were in phase five.

      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\" force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\"",

      "Satellite images and public documents helped identify likely carrier project",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",

      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",

      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's third conventionally powered aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducts a maiden sea trial on May 7, 2024. (Ding Ziyu/Xinhua via AP, File)",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",

      "Trump is not reported to have signed off on any specific steps yet. But according to the Journal, some advisers are encouraging him to push Kyiv to agree to terms that would freeze the frontlines by creating an 800-mile-long demilitarized zone and allow Russia to keep the land it has illegally seized, which amounts to roughly 20% of Ukraine.",
      "It has also been suggested that Kyiv should agree not to pursue NATO membership for 20 years, a stipulation that critics of this plan argue kowtows to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "Former CIA Moscow station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital that officials making these suggestions need \"to stop treating Ukraine like they're the aggressor state.\"",
      "\"They don't need to be pushed to make a deal,\" he said. \"The question is how you induce Putin to come to the table, not Ukraine.\"",

      "In an October interview, Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine during the Trump administration, told Germany's DW that he believes that upon entering the White House for a second time Trump will look to pressure Putin to end the war, further saying that Trump \"would very likely go much further\" in aiding Kyiv than the Biden administration.",

      "Sources in the NATO alliance, Ukraine and Republicans on Capitol Hill have voiced concern to Fox News Digital over the uncertainty that remains surrounding Trump\u2019s ambiguous stance on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, though Trump\u2019s history of attacking those who disagree with him meant sources were hesitant to go on the record when speaking about these concerns with Fox News Digital.",
      "There remains a stark division among Republicans in Congress between those who are ardently opposed to arming Ukraine as security concerns over China mount and lawmakers who argue that backing Ukraine is vitally important to U.S. security as it weakens Russia, which is closely allied with Beijing.",

      "Several conservatives in the House and Senate, who have backed U.S. aid for Ukraine, did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions over the mounting concern that the proposals being put in front of Trump call for anything but better arming Kyiv.",
      "Additionally, several contacts Fox News Digital spoke with said that given Trump\u2019s unclear stance on the U.S.\u2019s role in the Russia-Ukraine war and the fact that he has not yet staffed his Cabinet, it is too soon to speculate what Washington\u2019s policy will be in Ukraine.",

Tehran has also launched two aerial drone and missile attacks on the Jewish state in 2024.",
      "U.S.-Israel Mideast expert Caroline Glick, who served as an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News Digital, \"Trump's policy of respecting the prerogatives of Israel's democratically elected government will enable Prime Minister Netanyahu and his ministers to pursue their strategy of victory over Iran and its proxies to its successful conclusion. Israel does not seek direct U.S. involvement in the war. Rather, it hopes that the U.S. will provide it with diplomatic and other support to enable it to achieve victory against foes common to the U.S. and Israel.\"",

Trump support for an Israeli victory will enable the president to preside over a post-war period of calm and unprecedented peace, which is only possible after an Israeli victory.\"",

      "He added that peace and prosperity in the Middle East \"requires dealing with the\u00a0dangers of a nuclear Iran.

Turkey's alleged involvement in facilitating Hamas\u2019s activities, including granting them passports and aiding money laundering, complicates relations further.\"",
      "\"Turkey found relief in Trump\u2019s presidency, in contrast to Biden, who had criticized Erdo\u011fan's democratic backslide, notably excluding Turkey from the 2021 Summit for Democracy,\" Aviv added. \"Under Trump,\u00a0American pastor Andrew Brunson was released from Turkish custody. However, despite Trump\u2019s generally favorable stance, tensions persist. Trump imposed sanctions on Turkey five times during his tenure, and key issues, such as U.S. support for Kurdish groups and Turkey\u2019s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system, remain divisive.\"",

Unlike Trump 1.0, he has a much more isolationist VP in JD Vance, and he also at the same time told Netanyahu to finish up the war in Gaza. And while he has expressed an interest in a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, he has a history of taking aggressive actions against it, and his communications were targeted by the regime during his campaign, which may fuel distrust and suspicion.\"",

      "Amid a presidential loss and hand-wringing over the wreckage, congressional gains for Democrats in New York state are one of the small bright spots shining out from the party\u2019s bleak results.",
      "The Democratic Party lost five competitive House races in this blue state two years ago \u2014 the exact margin by which they lost the House majority. Now, three of those districts are back in Democratic hands (plus a fourth Democrats claimed in an early 2024 special election), even as Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed her former running mate, President Joe Biden, in the state.",
      "New York\u2019s unlikely battleground state status might inform Democrats\u2019 path forward, including the receipts from early investment and sustained organizing on the ground, as well as candidates who ran ahead of the national ticket and who weren\u2019t afraid to buck the national party line.",
      "One key ingredient isn\u2019t available everywhere: Democrats redrew the state political maps early this year, though that move gave some Democrats heartburn at the time. Still, Democratic winners and leaders from the state still see broader lessons.",
      "\u201cIn places that Gov. Hochul lost by a lot, or that Vice President Harris lost by a lot, we either won or lost by less,\u201d Rep.-elect Josh Riley told NBC News days after he flipped New York\u2019s upstate 19th Congressional District. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because \u2014 I like to think anyway \u2014 that that\u2019s because my approach to this hasn\u2019t been around partisanship and political parties. It\u2019s really focused on the concerns folks have when they\u2019re sitting down at the kitchen table.\u201d",
      "In Riley\u2019s district, a win meant earning the backing of Republicans and Democrats alike. Biden carried the district by 4 points in 2020, and preliminary data suggests the presidential split was much closer this time.",
      "\u201cWe should be respectful enough of people to see what they see with their own eyes,\u201d Riley said of the conversations he had in his district. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of Democrats running around saying \u2018the economy is good,\u2019 and then I go and talk to a young family who\u2019s telling me they had to cut back on their grocery bill because the rent is too damn high. I think it\u2019s just having a dose of reality of what folks are dealing with.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a matter of having the resources to get that message across.",
      "In the aftermath of 2022, three top New York Democrats \u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries \u2014 joined together via a coordinated committee that allowed them to pool cash and staff resources through the state party to support downballot candidates. The three leaders built a political apparatus that boasted 38 offices across seven competitive districts and just shy of 100 full-time staff. By Election Day, the coordinated campaign had engaged over 23,000 volunteers, knocked more than 1 million doors, and made 5 million phone calls, according to the group, capping off an \u201cunprecedented\u201d effort in the state.",
      "\u201cNew York recognized very early on that we had become a battleground state and we needed a battleground operation,\u201d\u00a0a source directly familiar with the coordinated campaign told NBC News, speaking anonymously to give a more candid assessment.",
      "Organizers drew inspiration from other states, like Wisconsin, that had recalibrated in the face of past electoral defeats. But staffers also challenged themselves to get creative, too, like providing organizers with wagons full of Diet Coke to pull around the Syracuse University \u2014 a notorious \u201cPepsi campus\u201d where Coke is hard to come by \u2014 leading up to Election Day, giving would-be voters a dose of caffeine along with voting location information.",
      "The source directly familiar with the coordinated campaign saw New York as a place \u201cthat has actually gone against the narrative\u201d in 2024, at least at the House level.",
      "\u201cIt was a Trump wave on top,\u201d this person said, \u201cbut that couldn\u2019t save incumbent House Republicans in part because I think we had built a sophisticated voter contact operation across all of these districts\u201d and because candidates \u201cunderstood the nature of their districts.\u201d",
      "Still, a Republican strategist who worked on the New York races was quick to remind that it wasn\u2019t a clean sweep of competitive seats for Democrats, who weren\u2019t able to flip the 1st or 17th districts. \u201cClearly they though there was more ground than there was,\u201d the strategist said while predicting continued fluctuations in New York.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at an overarching realignment that started in earnest in 2022, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet,\u201d the strategist said, noting Trump's gains with voters of color and other voter groups in and around New York City.",
      "In the lead-up to Election Day, Republicans were keen to stoke concerns about Harris\u2019 negative effect on vulnerable downballot Democrats.\u00a0Internal polling from the House GOP campaign arm across the seven competitive House districts showed Harris trailing Biden\u2019s margins \u2013 and even giving Trump an edge. Ultimately, while Biden carried New York by 23 points in 2020, Harris\u2019 margin was nearly halved.",
      "\u201cI think [Harris] was helpful as compared to where we would have otherwise been, just because of how weakened Biden had been in the public eye,\u201d the source said, saying Harris energized the base. \u201cWe needed an energized base and then our candidates could go out there and persuade voters that they were the right candidates to defeat these [GOP] incumbents.\u201d",
      "Riley, one of the candidates able to do just that, says it isn\u2019t as complicated as some are making it out to be.",
      "\u201cIf all you did was talk to quote-unquote political experts and pundits, you\u2019d think there\u2019s some mystery to be solved here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you spent a day talking to people on Birdsall Street, they\u2019re going to tell you they\u2019re angry that our immigration system is broken. And they\u2019re even angrier that politicians aren\u2019t being straight with them about it.\u201d"

Part of this may be because of the county\u2019s sizable Orthodox community, which leans more to the right than the Jewish population as a whole.

      "The judge overseeing Donald Trump's New York criminal trial delayed a key ruling Tuesday on whether the president-elect's conviction should be set aside, according to correspondence between the parties.",
      "Trump\u2019s team wants the case dismissed, and the prosecution says it needs time to evaluate next steps now that Trump has been elected for a second term. The court has granted them a week's delay to provide their positions, the clerk informed them in a court filing.",
      "In a letter to state Judge Juan Merchan, prosecutors said they agreed with Trump's request for a stay to consider how to proceed given his new status as president-elect.",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances and that the arguments raised by defense counsel in correspondence to the People on Friday require careful consideration to ensure that any further steps in this proceeding appropriately balance the competing interests of (1) a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and (2) the Office of the President,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, the People respectfully request that the Court adjourn the upcoming scheduled dates to afford the People time to assess these recent developments, and set November 19. 2024 as a deadline for the People to advise the Court regarding our view of appropriate steps,\" he added.",
      "In response, Merchan's clerk said the joint request for a stay had been granted and ordered prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office to state their position by 10 a.m. on the 19th.",
      "Trump had tentatively been scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26, and it\u2019s unclear when or whether the judge would proceed with the sentencing.",
      "Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung celebrated the development in a statement, noting that Merchan has \"now stayed all previously scheduled deadlines, including sentencing in this case.\"",
      "He said Trump's election makes it \"abundantly clear that Americans want an immediate end to the weaponization of our justice system, including this case, which should have never been filed.\"",
      "Trump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "The decision Merchan was expected to hand down Tuesday was on Trump's motion to overturn the conviction and dismiss the indictment on the grounds the case included some evidence that prosecutors should not have been able to use under the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came down on July 1, days before Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced in New York.",
      "The New York case was the only one of the four criminal cases brought against Trump after he left office in 2021 to go to trial, and the jury verdict marked the first time a former president had ever been convicted of a crime.",
      "The Justice Department is winding down the two federal criminal cases against the former and future president. The Justice Department\u2019s\u00a0thinking\u00a0on Trump\u2019s federal cases\u00a0emanates\u00a0from\u00a0a 2020 memo\u00a0by the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which affirmed a\u00a0Watergate-era conclusion that a prosecution of a sitting president would \u201cunduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the presidency.\u201d",
      "The demise of those cases leaves one other pending prosecution against Trump: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' racketeering case alleging he and over a dozen co-conspirators illegally tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "That case has been on pause while Trump and some of his co-defendants seek to have an appeals court remove Willis from the case over allegations of conflict of interest. Given the status of the case, legal experts have told NBC News, any Trump trial would have to wait until he\u2019s out of office in 2029 because of constitutional issues."

      "His lawyers argued that the case should be moved because he was acting as a \u201cfederal officer\u201d at the time and could therefore argue for immunity from prosecution.",
      "The argument failed in lower courts, with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluding that because Meadows is no longer a federal official, the provision that would allow the case to be moved to federal court does not apply to him.",
      "The appeals court also found that even if he was deemed to be a federal officer, \"the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related to Meadows' official duties.\"",
      "Meadows faces two counts in the sprawling Georgia election interference case over his role in efforts to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty.",

But\u00a0the president-elect carried Florida by nearly 13 points this year, giving Trump a shot of political capital and at least the perception of leverage.",
      "\u201cI think that pick makes a lot of sense and would be great for Florida,\u201d said a Trump ally who acknowledged there is interest from Trump world in seeing DeSantis appoint Lara Trump. \u201cHe had a great night last Tuesday. He won by huge margins, including in Florida. I think it\u2019s pretty clear the move would not be controversial with Florida Republicans.\u201d",
      "But Trump's wishes are far from the only consideration when it comes to a Senate seat that hasn't been open in 14 years. Another route getting significant attention, according to five sources NBC News spoke with, would be the so-called placeholder strategy.",
      "Under that scenario, DeSantis would likely appoint James Uthmeier, his longtime chief of staff and top political adviser who also did legal work for Trump's first campaign and advised former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

      "\"I think the James option is very much open. If DeSantis wanted to run for the seat, James would get out of the way, and if he did not, a trusted DeSantis ally would run for re-election,\" a longtime DeSantis adviser said. \"DeSantis controls the outcome either way.\"",
      "How the appointment process plays out would depend on whether the nascent push for Lara Trump by some figures turns into a harder lobbying effort from Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s political home base \u2014 and then how DeSantis reacts to that pressure, if it materializes.",
      "\u201cAre they going to be able to alpha dog him?\u201d the same source said of DeSantis.",
      "DeSantis' team is aware of the dynamic.",
      "\"I have heard that too,\" a DeSantis ally said of Lara Trump getting in the mix for the Senate appointment. \"But also have heard from someone very high up that there is some dissension on whether that's a good idea.\"",
      "There's another possibility, though it's an increasingly unlikely move: DeSantis would be allowed to appoint himself, a scenario that first presented itself over the summer when Trump was considering Rubio as a potential running mate.",
      "Two DeSantis advisers told NBC News that it is very unlikely DeSantis would appoint himself, even though the option remains open.",
      "Others on the list of potential appointments include Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, state Attorney General Ashley Moody, state House Speaker Paul Renner, former state House Speaker Jose Oliva and Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., who was the first member of Congress to endorse DeSantis\u2019 presidential run, which was considered controversial because most of Florida\u2019s Republican congressional delegation backed Trump.",
      "\u201cI think there are some scenarios more likely than others,\u201d a DeSantis ally said, signaling the placeholder strategy is likely. \u201cBut no matter what direction the governor takes, there is a lot of talent available for the pick.\u201d",
      "DeSantis' rough relationship with Trump was one reason his pick of Rubio for secretary of state surprised many Florida political watchers.",
      "DeSantis and Trump were close when the then-president propelled DeSantis\u2019 once long-shot bid for governor in 2018, but there was a nasty falling out between the two as it became clear DeSantis would run against Trump in 2024. Another complicating factor: After that 2018 election, DeSantis fired his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, who has since become a mainstay in Trump\u2019s political operation and will serve as his chief of staff.",
      "Wiles and DeSantis still have bad blood, which left some to posit she did not hand him a Senate appointment without a plan.",
      "\u201cMy sense is they have a plan for the Florida angle,\u201d said a longtime Florida operative familiar with the Trump team's decision-making process. \u201cThe last thing [Trump\u2019s team] wants is to hand Ron an opportunity to really shuffle things around and create some sustained power for his crew, so I\u2019ve got to believe they will push hard if Ron is resistant.\u201d",
      "Because Trump has no ability to force DeSantis\u2019 hand, the \u201cpush hard\u201d portion of things could come in the form of Trump\u2019s huge right-wing social media and podcast ecosystem, which has helped make or break Republican political careers in the past. Most recently, this loose coalition has been trying to push Sen. Rick Scott of Florida over the finish line in his effort to become Senate majority leader, according to multiple media reports.",
      "\u201cI am actually going to make a public call for Gov. DeSantis to appoint Lara Trump to fill Marco Rubio\u2019s term in office,\u201d Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, an early Trump backer, told Benny Johnson, a prominent Trump supporter with more than 3 million followers on X. \u201cShe would avoid a really nasty primary in two years.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m giving her my full backing,\u201d she continued of Lara Trump, who is a North Carolina resident. \u201cI\u2019m giving her my full backing.\u201d"

      "Trump has told Noem that she is his pick for DHS secretary, according to two sources familiar with the decision.",
      "Noem, 52, has no significant experience with homeland security issues but has voiced support for Trump's hard-line immigration policies. She has defended her fellow Republican governors in their efforts to crack down on migrants in their states.",
      "In January, for example, she said in remarks that there was an \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and said that her administration was considering helping Texas deter immigration at the southern border by sending it security personnel and razor wire.

And that cannot continue to happen.\"",
      "Asked in the interview about Trump's possible plans to pardon convicted Jan. 6 rioters, she dodged the question and said t would be his prerogative.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as the U.S. ambassador to Israel, a high-profile diplomatic posting in a tumultuous region.",
      "Huckabee, if confirmed, will be the first non-Jewish person to hold this role since 2011. He will arrive in Jerusalem to face conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon that have raged for more than a year. On the campaign trail, Trump, a close ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to put an end to the conflict.",
      "Peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled in recent days after Qatar pulled out of its meditation efforts. Huckabee is likely to be at the center of international pressure on the U.S. to help broker a cease-fire deal.",
      "Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, elevating a longtime loyalist and former rival for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Huckabee, the host of a namesake television talk show, campaigned for Trump this election cycle, hitting the trail with the former president, including in battleground Pennsylvania in the final throes of the race.",
      "\u201cI am pleased to announce that the Highly Respected former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has been nominated to be The United States Ambassador to Israel,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
      "\u201cMike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\u201d",
      "In a statement congratulating Huckabee, the Republican Jewish Coalition praised the former governor as \"a long-time friend\" of the group, praising the former governor's \"abounding love of Israel\" and promising his appointment would \"strengthen the US-Israel relationship to even greater heights.\"",
      "Huckabee's daughter, the current Arkansas governor and a former Trump administration official, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was also a top surrogate for Trump. The elder Huckabee, 69, was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007.",
      "During his 2016 presidential run, Huckabee staked out an arch-conservative position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rejecting the notion of an \"occupied\" West Bank. Instead, he referred to the area using the biblical terms of\u00a0\u201cJudea and Samaria.\u201d",
      "At the time, he earned the Adelson Defender of Israel award at a Zionist Organization of America dinner in New York. Miriam Adelson, the wife of the late Sheldon Adelson, remains a top Trump donor who gave lavishly to his 2024 campaign.",
      "Top Israeli officials celebrated the news later Tuesday.",
      "Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar congratulated Huckabee in a post on X, saying, \"As a longstanding friend of Israel and our eternal capital Jerusalem \u2014 I hope you will feel very much at home.\"",
      "Trump, during his first term, formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the U.S. Embassy to the city from Tel Aviv, fulfilling a controversial campaign promise. The former president also brokered bilateral agreements to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Bahrain.",
      "Now, Trump has promised to bring lasting peace to the region and to \"stop wars\" amid a raging humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and a conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
      "The war in Gaza has ground on since Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023. 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019 attack, with over 250 people taken hostage, including American citizens. Over 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the outbreak of the war, according to Gaza health officials.",
      "In a separate statement Tuesday, Trump announced that he would appoint businessman Steve Witkoff, who founded a namesake real estate company in 1997, to be his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "Witkoff, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, is a longtime friend and political donor of Trump's. The two were golfing together in September during the second attempt on Trump's life.",
      "Witkoff also attended Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress in July."

    "title": "A party, a fight, then gunfire: Witnesses describe a war zone after Tuskegee's homecoming",
    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 21:29:18 GMT",
    "summary": "What started as a joyous weekend to celebrate Tuskegee University\u2019s centennial homecoming, within seconds, descended into violent tragedy early Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "As successive gunshots rang out early Sunday morning in a parking lot at Tuskegee University in Alabama, Kierra Talley thought she was going to die. Talley, a junior at Alabama State University, was visiting Tuskegee with friends to celebrate the historically Black college\u2019s centennial homecoming celebration when, she said, chaos erupted.",
      "\u201cIt was people shooting back at each other \u2014 whether it was in the crowd, outside of the crowd, inside of a dormitory \u2014 people were shooting,\u201d said Talley, 20, who added that she saw at least four gunmen with \u201cheavy ARs\u201d and guns with \u201cswitches,\u201d a small device that turns a semiautomatic gun into a fully automatic firearm.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t one person,\u201d she said. \u201cI describe it as a massacre.\u201d",
      "One person was fatally shot in the ordeal and at least 16 others were injured, including a dozen with gunshot wounds, according to local police. The person killed was 18-year-old La\u2019Tavion Johnson, the local coroner said Monday. He was not a student at Tuskegee, the university said in a statement.",
      "Videos circulating on social media show what appears to be a portion of the gunfire as dozens of people ran behind cars to take cover, some attempting to sprint to safety and others jumping to the ground. The beginning of the first shooting video in one X post captured what sounded like one shot after another initially, until seconds later there was a steady stream of gunfire that appeared to come from multiple guns lasting several minutes.",
      "Classes were canceled for students Monday and Tuesday and grief counselors were provided.",
      "In a news conference Monday, Tuskegee University President and CEO Mark Brown said the school community is \u201cheartbroken by what happened,\u201d adding that though the block party was an unsanctioned event, the school takes \u201cfull responsibility.\u201d He noted that moving forward the university would be closed to anyone who was not a student, faculty or staff member.",
      "University officials declined to provide NBC News any further comment on the shooting or investigation.",
      "Police arrested 25-year-old Jaquez Myrick of Montgomery and charged him with possession of a machine gun, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said in a news release. It was not clear if Myrick was a student. He was taken into custody while attempting to leave the scene, however, the agency did not say whether he is a suspect in the shooting. As of Tuesday afternoon, he remains in Montgomery County jail under U.S. Marshals custody, officials said. It\u2019s not clear if he has an attorney.",
      "In a newly unsealed federal complaint, according to the Associated Press, Myrick told federal agents that he shot his gun, but denied shooting at anyone.",
      "The agency said it had no additional information to provide at this time. The FBI has also joined the shooting investigation and has asked the public for tips and set up a website to accept videos and images about the incident.",
      "Celebration turned into tragedy",
      "According to Talley, people were gathered in the parking lot for the school\u2019s annual block party, which marks the final large gathering of homecoming weekend. There were a record 47,000 attendees at the football game just hours earlier on campus and hundreds, including children, remained on campus dancing to music from car speakers and enjoying drinks late into the night.",
      "Around midnight, Talley said she saw a small fight break out between a few people, which, she said, led to some people running for safety. But once the fight ended, Talley said things calmed down and after some time even more people congregated in the parking lot. Though it\u2019s been unconfirmed by law enforcement, Talley believes the fight was a precursor to the shooting.",
      "About an hour later is when the first sounds of gunfire erupted, Talley recalled, as she hid behind her car in fear for her life. One of her friends, who goes by Tony P., she said, was shot twice and as of Tuesday remains in the hospital. Talley estimates the gunfire lasted for at least eight minutes before she saw the first officer on the scene. Another 15 to 20 minutes passed, she said, until she saw additional officers.",
      "The steady stream of gunfire made the minutes feel like an eternity, she said.",
      "\u201cSeeing and hearing how close they were was very traumatic,\u201d Talley said, \u201cespecially because it was shooters everywhere.\u201d",
      "The closest hospitals that victims were taken to were more than 25 miles away \u2014 East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika, Alabama, which is a 30-minute drive from the campus, and Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, which is nearly an hour away.",
      "Talley said she saw people bleeding out at the scene, and when she went to visit her friend at Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery that night, she said she saw people with gunshot wounds on gurneys awaiting medical attention.",
      "\u201cThe medical service here is not up to par,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cpeople can\u2019t afford to have health care. \u2026 That is traumatizing and we\u2019re expected to be there and be strong.\u201d",
      "With a population of 9,000 residents, the city of Tuskegee has a median household income of $32,000. One in three residents live in poverty. Ninety percent of the community is Black and about 8% white, according to recent census data. About 2,900 students are enrolled at the university.",
      "Tuskegee freshman Joaquin Crayton Jr. believes the university holds some liability for the shooting and its aftermath, particularly in not keeping students safe. Crayton said he was on the outskirts of the party when he heard gunfire and took off running toward his residence hall, Banneker Hall. He said he ran there for safety only to learn that a gunman was searching the dormitory\u2019s hallways for someone.",
      "\u201cWhen you are fleeing and running for your life, you gain a different kind of perspective,\u201d Crayton, 19, said. \u201cI thought I was safe in my dorm. I wasn\u2019t. A man went into our dorm room with a loaded gun and was looking for someone.\u201d",
      "Crayton, an aerospace engineering major, said members of the student body and the school president held a virtual town hall on Monday to discuss the shooting, but he said it got \u201cnowhere\u201d with students consistently being muted after trying to speak up about their safety concerns. Crayton said he believes the university has not been forthcoming with information about the number of injured victims and its shortcomings in regard to student safety last weekend. Though the block party event may have been unsanctioned, he said, it happens every year and given the school\u2019s centennial celebration, he believes school leadership should have been more prepared.",
      "\u201cAs a collective we are pissed off about what the school is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a different kind of trauma for different age groups of 18- to 22-year-olds to come together to make sure this never happens again.\u201d",
      "Recent gun violence at HBCU homecomings",
      "Tuskegee is not the only HBCU reeling from gun violence during homecoming celebrations. Last month, in Nashville, one man was fatally shot and nine others wounded, including three children, during Tennessee State University\u2019s homecoming parade as two groups traded gunfire. At Albany State University in Georgia the following week, one person was fatally shot and four others injured during homecoming weekend. And at Alabama State, school officials last month reported shots fired during their homecoming activities, though there were no reported injuries.",
      "Fighting back tears, Talley said: \u201cWhen is it going to stop?\u201d",
      "The business management major blames the Tuskegee shooting on the lack of personal accountability in the Black community; the lack of gun reform in Alabama; and too little national attention that mass shootings involving African Americans get in the media.",
      "\u201cTuskegee is already a small town,\u201d she said. \u201cIf nobody is saying anything about this town, then this town is just forgotten \u2014 in a society where people already want to erase HBCUs and Black culture.\u201d",
      "More than 24 hours removed from the experience, Talley said she is filled with a mix of emotions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m pissed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that it wasn\u2019t me, but I\u2019m beyond pissed.\u201d",
      "Less than three months into his college experience, Crayton said he feels let down and the student body feels \u201cdefeated.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur security failed us, the police failed us, our campus police failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many people have to die?\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0 The \"r\" in royal will soon exclusively be lowercase \u2014 in spirit, at least.",
      "That's if Prince William gets his way.",
      "The older son of King Charles III and the late Princess Diana, and the heir to the British throne, has revealed he wants to approach official duties with \u201ca smaller r in the royal,\u201d perhaps the clearest hint yet of how he thinks the British monarchy should evolve as it seeks to navigate its place in the world after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "\u201cI can only describe what I\u2019m trying to do and that\u2019s trying to do it differently and I\u2019m trying to do it for my generation,\u201d William, 42, told Sky News on Saturday as he wrapped up a weeklong tour of South Africa in the legislative capital, Cape Town.",
      "Elaborating on what that meant to him, he said that \u201cit\u2019s more about impact philanthropy, collaboration, convening and helping people.\"",
      "William added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m also going to throw empathy in there as well, because I really care about what I do. It helps impact people\u2019s lives. And I think we could do with some more empathetic leadership around the world.\u201d",
      "William has thought about how he might make his mark and approach things differently in both his current role as the Prince of Wales and, one day, as king, NBC\u00a0News royal commentator\u00a0Daisy McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cHe will be all too aware of how dangerous it is for the royal family to be seen to be out of touch or aloof and hence the emphasis on empathy and emotional intelligence,\u201d she said.",
      "British tabloids offered positive coverage, with The Mirror describing William's comments as a \"huge royal shake-up\" and The Sun splashing: \"MONARCHY WITH EMPATHY.\"",
      "But the comments have not received a universally warm response.",
      "Graham Smith, CEO of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, told NBC News of the heir to the throne: \u201cHis \u2018r\u2019 couldn\u2019t get any smaller, to be honest. He barely does anything at all. He\u2019s an incredibly lazy man who manages to get a pretty small splashing of engagements to look like he is busy.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry\u2019s decision to step away from royal duties and his subsequent move to the United States has fueled a public conversation about the monarchy's relevance and future in Britain.",
      "\u201cWhat Harry has done is shown that royals can walk away and do the right thing under their own steam. They can fund their own lifestyles and get celebrity endorsements and do just fine,\u201d Smith said.",
      "\u201cSo why his brother feels that he needs to hang on to the titles and the status and the public money, I think, is a question that is only highlighted by Harry\u2019s departure,\u201d he added.",
      "Kensington Palace did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dressing down",
      "William\u2019s effort to appear less formal even extends to his choice of clothes, McAndrew suggested.",
      "He sparked a debate on social media during his South Africa trip when he wore white trainers and an open-necked shirt.",
      "Royal fashion is a subject of intense scrutiny, so \u201cbeing out of touch also extends to actions as well as words and even to what clothes the royals wear,\u201d McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cDressing down ticks two boxes \u2014 less extravagant and more \u2018normal\u2019. But, some members of the public actively want their royals to be as glamorous\u00a0as possible, so it\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she added.",
      "But for Smith, this highlights a broader contradiction.",
      "Because their status comes from the institution itself, the public\u2019s interest in the royals isn\u2019t about seeing them as regular people, he  said.",
      "\u201cI guess what he\u2019s trying to say is he wants to look less royal. But, you know, if you look less royal, then what\u2019s the point of being a royal?\u201d Smith said.",
      "William's comments about changing the royals' approach follow a particularly difficult time for the family.",
      "He also spoke last week about how \u201cbrutal\u201d the past year has been, with his wife and his father diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been dreadful. It\u2019s probably been the hardest year in my life,\u201d he told Sky News.",
      "Charles led Remembrance Day commemorations in London on Sunday as the\u00a0United Kingdom remembered British and Commonwealth service members who have\u00a0lost their lives in conflicts.",
      "He was joined by William and Princess Kate, who has slowly returned to public duties following her treatment for cancer.",
      "Queen Camilla missed the occasion after\u00a0falling ill with a chest infection\u00a0that forced her to withdraw from public duties. She was set to return to duties Tuesday, though with a slightly reduced schedule."

    "story": [
      "Former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years for stealing classified information from the Pentagon and sharing it online, the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts announced.",
      "Teixeira was sentenced before Judge Indira Talwani in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.",
      "Attorneys representing Teixeira didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In court, the airman apologized, according to coverage of the hearing by NBC affiliate WJAR of Providence, R.I.",
      "\"All of the responsibility falls on my shoulders,\" Teixeira said. \"And I accept what that may bring.\"",
      "The office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts argued for a 200-month sentence, or roughly 17 years, the maximum under an agreement between Teixeira and federal prosecutors.",
      "Talwani noted the document leak happened after extensive training that covered the consequences for leaks and after Teixeira was warned about the way he handled classified material, according to WJAR.",
      "\u201cDespite that, you posted on the internet hundreds of documents over the period of a year,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The defendant's attorneys argued for a sentence on the low end of the range, noting that the maximum of 200 months would be more than the government sought against Julian Assange, who is accused of publishing a trove of classified documents.",
      "They argued that Teixeira's autism and isolation during the pandemic contributed to his behavior.",
      "In March, the national guardsman pleaded guilty to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. The plea was part of the agreement, which included a recommended sentence of 11 to 17 years. He was arrested by the FBI in North Dighton, Massachusetts, in April 2023 and has been in federal custody since mid-May 2023.",

      "Joshua S. Levy, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said the defendant's crimes put U.S. personnel abroad at mortal risk, damaged relationships with allies and may have revealed some of the ways the country gathers such material.",
      "\"He leaked information that the government determined was likely to cause grave damage to the United States,\" he said at the news conference.",
      "Among the documents exposed was information on troop movements, he said.",
      "According to court documents, Teixeira transcribed classified documents that he then shared on Discord, a social media platform mostly used by online gamers. He began sharing the documents in or around 2022, in part to impress peers on the platform, prosecutors alleged.",
      "A document he was accused of leaking included information about providing equipment to Ukraine, while another included discussions about a foreign adversary's plot to target American forces abroad, prosecutors said.",
      "Teixeira entered the Air National Guard in 2019 and held the rank of airman first class. He was based at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, where he was assigned to the 102nd Intelligence Wing as a cyber transport systems journeyman.",
      "He was able to access the documents because he held a top-secret security clearance since around July 2021 and had received training in the definition of classified information, classification levels and proper handling of the material, according to the indictment.",
      "While the documents were discovered online in March 2023, Teixeira had been sharing them online for more than a year, according to prosecutors.",
      "Levy said the sentence could serve as a warning to anyone pondering such a leak. \"The judge recognized the gravity of this conduct and the enduring nature of the harm,\" he said.",
      "While sentencing closed a chapter of the case, Levy argued wreckage caused by the defendant will continue to resonate.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t know the full extent of Jack Teixeira\u2019s damage for several years,\" he said."

      "Crews in New Jersey and New York were continuing to battle a wildfire in Passaic and Orange counties. The inferno \u2014 dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service \u2014 had grown to 3,500 acres and was 20% contained as of Tuesday morning.",
      "Two residential structures in New Jersey were threatened by the fire, the agency said in an update just after 9 a.m. Tuesday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday afternoon that there was a statewide \"burn ban.\"",
      "\"What that means is completely avoid outdoor burning, don't leave any campfires ... unattended, don't have them, exercise extreme caution with outdoor grills and report fires immediately,\" she said.",
      "The fall has been historically dry, said Jackie Bray, commissioner of the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services. She told reporters that in an average year, about 1,400 acres are burned in New York.",
      "The Jennings Creek fire has already burned about 2,700, said Bray, noting that it is \"well above normal.\"",
      "Another fire in Passaic County, New Jersey, the Cannonball 3 Wildfire, was fully contained Sunday, the state's forest fire service said.",
      "In Massachusetts, more than a dozen brush fires were burning, NBC Boston reported. Dave Celino, chief fire warden for the state Department of Conservation and Recreation, told the news station that in November there have been 247 fires across the state with almost 700 acres burned.",
      "\"Some of them have grown, some of them have come out of containment because of the wind event,\" Celino said.",
      "Across the country in California, the Mountain Fire continues to burn in Ventura County. The blaze, which started Nov. 6, has grown to 20,630 acres and is 48% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.",
      "At least 200 structures have been destroyed and there have been six confirmed fire personnel and civilian injuries, Cal Fire said.",
      "There will be a wind event this week, but nothing like the conditions that caused the fire to explode in size last week, officials said. Firefighters have made great progress since then, Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said Monday.",
      "\"The fire is looking really good,\u201d he said. He sought to allay fears of residents who feel the wind change.",
      "\"The Mountain Fire, we all feel comfortable, is buttoned up,\" Gardner said. \"You may see flare-ups, you may see dust-ups and you\u2019re going to feel a lot of ash and dust if you\u2019re downwind from this fire. So let's get ready for that.\""

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:30:55 GMT",
    "summary": "A woman in Kentucky who is seeking an abortion filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to strike down the state\u2019s near-total ban.",
    "story": [
      "A woman in Kentucky who is seeking an abortion filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to strike down the state\u2019s near-total ban.",
      "The suit, filed by a woman referred to in the documents as Mary Poe, alleges that two Kentucky abortion laws violate the state constitution\u2019s rights to privacy and self-determination. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday afternoon in the Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement and complaint shared first with NBC News that the lawsuit reflects \u201cthe severe harms that Mary Poe, who is approximately seven weeks pregnant, is suffering because the government has denied her access to the care she needs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal. This involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me,\u201d Poe said in a statement. \u201cThis is my personal decision, a decision I believe should be mine alone, not one made by anyone else. I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community.\u201d",
      "Kentucky enacted two laws after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision in 2022 overturned the right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade. The first law prohibits seeking or administering an abortion in almost all instances. The second makes it a felony for doctors in Kentucky to perform the procedure after the sixth week of pregnancy except to prevent the death or \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\u201d of the pregnant woman. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or a fatal fetal condition.",
      "Poe's lawsuit seeks a ruling that finds the two laws unconstitutional and unenforceable.",
      "The suit names the attorney general of Kentucky and other state officials as defendants.",
      "Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican who supports adding exceptions to the state's ban for rape and incest, said his office will do as it is tasked and \u201czealously work to uphold these laws in court.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy position has not changed. After listening to prosecutors, crime victims and my family, I believe the law should be amended to include exceptions for rape and incest in addition to the existing exception for life and health of the mother,\u201d Coleman said in the statement. \u201cThis mainstream position is consistent with my faith, and I believe is shared by most Kentuckians, including so many who consider themselves pro-life.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of more than a dozen states where abortion is essentially banned or unavailable, and additional states have moved to restrict the procedure since Roe was overturned.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement that \u201cas we have seen in Kentucky and across the country, abortion bans have wreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Poe\u2019s lawsuit is also requesting class-action status for all pregnant people in Kentucky who are seeking access to abortion in the state but are not allowed to receive the medical treatment because of the abortion laws.",
      "The lawsuit said that Poe and other potential future class members \u201care suffering medical, constitutional, and irreparable harm because they are denied the ability to obtain an abortion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe threat of criminal penalties from the Bans has forced health care providers to stop providing abortions to Mary Poe and all others seeking this time-sensitive healthcare and they have been forced to turn away all patients seeking abortion in Kentucky since the two challenged laws were allowed to take effect,\u201d the suit said.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot proposal that would have changed the state constitution to explicitly say that it does not protect a right to abortion.",
      "Amber Duke, executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in the statement that the organization has been \u201cfighting tirelessly\u201d to restore access to abortion in the state and that she applauds \u201cMary\u2019s bravery in partnering with us to renew this legal fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope for an ultimate victory that aligns with the will of the people and overturns these unconstitutional bans,\u201d she said.",
      "In 2022, the ACLU was involved in a lawsuit brought by abortion providers on behalf of their patients. The Kentucky Supreme Court decided in that case that abortion providers as plaintiffs were not able to raise the constitutional rights of their patients.",
      "Another case\u00a0brought by a pregnant Kentuckian in 2023\u00a0was ultimately unable to proceed and was dismissed, according to the ACLU."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:09:50 GMT",
    "summary": "First Amendment advocates are concerned that Musk could use his sway as a Trump adviser to retaliate against a long list of enemies.",
    "story": [
      "In July, tech billionaire Elon Musk said he hoped some states would consider criminal prosecutions of people participating in what he called an advertiser \u201cboycott\u201d of platforms like his social media app, X.",
      "In October, Musk turned his attention to a former State Department official, Victoria Nuland, saying she should be \u201cprosecuted\u201d after she went on television and criticized him as a tool of the Kremlin.",
      "And then last week, Musk revived a long-running feud with a group that monitors hatred online, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, saying that its members should be prosecuted for \u201ctheir many crimes.\u201d",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, has in the past two years called for several of his opponents to be prosecuted, and it\u2019s something that free speech advocates say they could overlook if he were only an ordinary private citizen.",
      "But now that Musk is gaining political power as a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, his demands for criminal charges against critics are much more worrisome, according to scholars and groups devoted to the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cIf Elon Musk is appointed to some position within the administration, he will continue to jawbone \u2014 pressure others to be punished for their speech \u2014 and that raises very serious free speech concerns,\u201d said Nadine Strossen, a past president of the American Civil Liberties Union and a professor of law emerita at New York Law School.",
      "\u201cIn our system, the idea of holding somebody criminally liable for something they say is so antithetical to the concept of free speech,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the owner of X, has positioned himself as an intimate adviser of Trump after helping to propel the former president to a remarkable political comeback. Musk contributed at least $130 million of his own money and the megaphone of X, where he is listed as having 204 million followers.",
      "Strossen and other free speech advocates said they\u2019re concerned that Musk could use his influence to strike out at his enemies, or make sweeping changes that would help him do so, such as suggesting personnel for the Justice Department. Trump has already said he wants Musk to advise him on federal spending and efficiency.",
      "\u201cMusk\u2019s actions over the past few years call into question his stated commitment to free speech,\u201d Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an email. He cited X\u2019s increasing compliance with foreign governments\u2019 demands to censor content on the platform and the lawsuits against the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Media Matters.",
      "\u201cAny disputes Musk has with his critics should play out in the court of public opinion, not a court of law,\u201d Terr said.",
      "Musk and representatives at X did not respond to requests for comment on his calls for prosecution.",
      "According to NBC News' review of Musk\u2019s public statements, there\u2019s an established pattern of him attacking nonprofit groups, journalists and others who produce information that he disagrees with or that may not be helpful to his goals or image \u2014 a pattern that runs counter to frequent vows by him that he\u2019s a defender of the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech.",
      "An NBC News review of Musk\u2019s statements identified seven critics whom he has accused of criminal conduct: the three examples above, as well as the progressive news site Media Matters, lawyers who represent dissident Tesla shareholders, investors who have sold Tesla stock short and journalists who share details about where his private jet has traveled, which is publicly available information.",
      "Musk has also attempted to silence critics through civil lawsuits, suspensions on X, calls for ending donations and one call for unspecified general \u201crecrimination.\u201d",
      "Of the cases in which Musk pursued legal action, he has not won a court judgment against any of those critics or persuaded a prosecutor to bring criminal charges. X has a pending lawsuit against Media Matters and a pending appeal in a lawsuit that X lost against the Center for Countering Digital Hate. Musk and X have sometimes found allies among members of Congress or state attorneys general who have launched investigations.",
      "Media Matters and Nuland declined to comment. A Tesla shareholder lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Now, some First Amendment scholars say Musk\u2019s statements may chill speech further if they carry the weight of an implied threat from an incoming government official.",
      "Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said that there\u2019s often a large power difference between Musk and his critics \u2014 and that the difference is growing.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment obviously protects both Musk and his critics in making public pronouncements about each other,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cYet, Musk has the bigger bully pulpit, by virtue of his wealth and allies, and his relationship with Trump likely will allow him more leverage to drown out \u2014 and if necessary \u2014 to use his economic power to wear them down financially and to get Justice Department support in harassing and punishing them,\u201d he said.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Musk has for years buried certain critics under an avalanche of legal troubles. Sometimes courts have stood in the way. This year, when X lost its lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a federal judge called the suit an attempt by X to use the courts to silence a critic.",
      "\u201cThis case is about punishing the Defendants for their speech,\u201d U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote.",
      "The ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed an amicus brief in support of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.",
      "The feud between Musk and the Center for Countering Digital Hate  has continued. A report last month from a conservative news site, Racket News, said it obtained internal CCDH documents that listed the group\u2019s annual priorities as including \u201cKill Musk\u2019s Twitter,\u201d referring to the app now known as X.",
      "Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said in a phone interview that Musk\u2019s accusation of \u201cmany crimes\u201d was baseless. He said that the organization would not be intimidated into silence, and that he has faith in the ability of U.S. courts to protect his group and other critics of Musk.",
      "\u201cElon Musk is an incredibly thin-skinned man who\u2019s incapable of taking honest criticism, even when based on verifiable facts, and has already weaponized courts to try and punish his perceived enemies,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe live in a country of checks and balances, and we have faith in our judicial system and in the freedoms afforded to us by the Constitution,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed did not dispute the authenticity of the documents published by Racket News, but he said the phrase \u201cKill Musk\u2019s Twitter\u201d appeared to be from an individual\u2019s meeting notes, not an official policy document.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also criticized the Center for Countering Digital Hate on Thursday, sending the organization a demand for documents related to the \u201cKill Musk\u2019s Twitter\u201d language. Jordan\u2019s House subcommittee, the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, posted the demand on X.",
      "\u201cOur censorship investigation isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d the subcommittee\u2019s X account said. \u201cAll gas. No brakes.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said the center had received Jordan\u2019s letter \u201cand we intend to comply in a manner consistent with our legal obligations and constitutional rights, as we have in the past.\u201d",
      "The Center for Countering Digital Hate is only the latest in a long line of Musk\u2019s targets.",
      "X has an ongoing lawsuit in federal court in Texas against Media Matters over its reporting about neo-Nazi content on the platform. Musk\u2019s company alleges that Media Matters unlawfully interfered with X\u2019s contracts with advertisers, something Media Matters denies.",
      "In August, X successfully sued one critic out of existence: The advertising industry group GARM closed its doors two days after X sued it alleging it organized an illegal ad boycott.",
      "\u201cI strongly encourage any company who has been systematically boycotted by advertisers to file a lawsuit,\u201d Musk posted in August.",
      "\u201cThere may also be criminal liability via the RICO Act,\u201d he said, referring to an anti-racketeering law.",
      "A lawsuit by X against GARM\u2019s parent organization, the trade group World Federation of Advertisers, is ongoing in federal court in Texas. The federation declined to comment.",
      "X has suspended the accounts of some of Musk\u2019s critics including Travis Brown, a researcher of far-right influencers who developed several research tools that gathered data from the Internet Archive, X\u2019s API and other sources. X said Brown\u2019s account was suspended for violating its rules around data usage, according to Wired. Brown later said he was suing X in a German court, though he said in an email last week that the court had dismissed his claim for lack of jurisdiction. X has not commented on the suit. Brown\u2019s X account remains suspended.",
      "Also last year, X suspended the accounts of Aaron Greenspan and PlainSite, a website that Greenspan founded with a free database of hard-to-get public records. Greenspan, a critic of Musk, sued X and Musk and said in court papers that he was wrongly suspended for \u201cposting private information\u201d but not told any additional details. Lawyers for X said in court papers that the company had a right to suspend him under its terms of service. The accounts remain suspended, and Greenspan\u2019s suit is pending in federal court in San Francisco. Greenspan declined to comment.",
      "In 2022, Musk said he planned to take unspecified \u201clegal action\u201d against Jack Sweeney, a college student who had set up social media accounts to track the private jets of celebrities including Musk using publicly available flight data. Musk accused Sweeney of enabling an alleged stalker and banned his account from X, although police found no link between the reported stalking incident and the jet-tracking account, The Washington Post reported.",
      "Sweeney, whose work has angered other private jet users such as Taylor Swift, said in an interview last week that Musk never sued and that he\u2019s not worried.",
      "\u201cIf there was any grounds for these people to do so, they would have already,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t worry that I have an account for his. They are newsworthy people. It kind of just comes with the territory that people are interested in where you go.\u201d"

      "\u201cYour body, my choice\u201d \u2014 a phrase popularized by white nationalist Nick Fuentes \u2014 became the reigning chant among men on the far-right who commented on women\u2019s posts across social media, especially those who expressed sorrow at the election results, the report found.",
      "The phrase \u2014 a retaliatory play on \u201cmy body, my choice,\u201d which for decades has been a rallying cry for advocates of reproductive rights \u2014 surged shortly after Fuentes posted last Tuesday on X: \u201cYour body, my choice. Forever.\u201d",
      "The phrase was mentioned thousands of times per day on various social platforms in the week after the election, peaking at more than 12,000 mentions on Friday, according to the report, which was published Friday. Within a 24-hour period late last week, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found a 4,600% increase in mentions of the terms \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d and \u201cget back in the kitchen\u201d on X, the report stated.",
      "The institute said that it also observed reports of people using misogynistic language to harass women offline, including alleged instances of young boys repeating \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d on school campuses. Hats and T-shirts featuring the phrase have also popped up on some e-commerce sites.",
      "\u201cOne of the alarming characteristics of this trend is how quickly online influencers, known for propagating hate, can influence both online and offline behaviors, most especially the behaviors of young men,\u201d report co-author Isabelle Frances-Wright, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue\u2019s U.S. director of technology, wrote in an email statement.",
      "The report adds to some other examples of hateful rhetoric spreading after Trump\u2019s victory. Last week, scores of Black Americans across the country began receiving racist text messages telling them they had been chosen to pick cotton \u201cat the nearest plantation\u201d \u2014\u00a0prompting an investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement. (The source and motivation of these texts have not been established.)",
      "Gender played a central role in this year\u2019s election as Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign emphasized reproductive rights. Polls prior to the election had found a widening gender gap between the two candidates.",
      "Trump ended up outperforming many of those polls. NBC News Exit polling found that he drew 45% of all female voters compared to 53% for Harris \u2014 a significant improvement from 2020 when he lost women voters by 15 percentage points to Joe Biden. Trump also made gains with young women.",
      "Even before his election, Trump and his supporters had targeted Harris with misogynistic comments throughout her campaign. Trump said in July that world leaders would view Harris \u201clike a play toy\u201d based on her appearance, and his allies have suggested that Harris\u2019 political success is attributable to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. One now-deleted ad from Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC called Harris the \u201cC-word\u201d before going on to call her a \u201cCommunist.\u201d",
      "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue report found that many extremist politicians and influencers from the \u201cmanosphere\u201d \u2014 a network of online spaces where men often preach traditional notions of masculinity and espouse misogynistic stereotypes about women \u2014 were\u00a0emboldened after the re-election of Trump.",

      "In the days since President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0won the\u00a0presidential race, Nicole Bivens Collinson\u2019s phone has barely stopped ringing.",
      "Collinson, who helps lead the international trade and government relations division at the lobbying firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said she is fielding \u201cdozens and dozens and dozens\u201d of calls from anxious U.S. companies looking to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s hardline tariff plans by finding loopholes and exemptions.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely everyone is calling,\u201d Collinson told CNBC. \u201cIt is nonstop.\u201d",
      "Over the course of the 2024 campaign, Trump made universal tariffs a core tenet of his economic platform, floating a 20% tax on all imports from all countries with a specifically harsh 60% rate for Chinese goods.",
      "That hyper-protectionist trade approach sent chills up the spines of economists, Wall Street analysts and industry leaders who warned that across-the-board tariffs could make production \u2014 and in turn, consumer prices \u2014 more expensive, just as they were recovering from pandemic-era inflation spikes.",
      "\u201cThe threat of tariffs has alarmed retailers and a wide range of other U.S. businesses,\u201d David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, told CNBC.\u00a0\u201cOur members have been working on contingency plans since President Trump secured the nomination.\u201d",
      "Ron Sorini, a principal at the lobbying firm Sorini, Samet & Associates, echoed that sentiment, noting that he takes at least two to three calls a day to field companies\u2019 concerns about the proposed tariff ramp-up, especially in China.",
      "\u2033[Companies] question where they should go, and how do they get the components out [of China]? How do they get the whole supply chain out?\u201d Sorini said.",
      "When Trump unleashed his first set of\u00a0China tariffs\u00a0in 2018, securing an exemption became a golden ticket in corporate America, a way to safeguard a company\u2019s China-based supply chains rather than paying the hefty price of relocation.",
      "And to obtain that golden ticket, it paid to know the right people.",
      "A 2021\u00a0research study\u00a0found that applications for Trump\u2019s first-term tariff exemptions were more likely to be approved when they came from lobbying firms whose employees had made political contributions to the Republican Party.",
      "Now, with Trump set to retake the White House in a matter of weeks, tariff escalation is becoming a more likely reality.",
      "And in corporate America, the race is on to find the right lobbyists to help companies rub shoulders with the right people, to give them an advantage in securing tariff loopholes.",
      "\u201cFirms are prepared,\u201d SUNY Buffalo finance professor Veljko Fotak, one of the authors of the 2021 study, told CNBC. \u201cThe real winners of this process are going to be the lawyers and lobbyists.\u201d",
      "What tariffs will look like in the next Trump administration, and whether exemptions will be available at all, are both unknown.",
      "\u201cUntil that clarity comes, businesses will have to plan for a variety of scenarios,\u201d Tiffany Smith, vice president of global trade policy at the National Foreign Trade Council, told CNBC.",
      "In response to CNBC\u2019s request for comment about the Trump team\u2019s plan for exemptions and companies\u2019 concerns of the tariff proposals, Trump transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt doubled down on the president-elect\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\u201d Leavitt told CNBC in a statement.",
      "In the meantime, companies have been trying to set up defenses against Trump\u2019s more aggressive trade approach. These include stockpiling goods in the short run, readying price hikes so they can pass the cost of import duties on to customers, and trying to move their production out of China.",

      "Who would you put on your Mount Rushmore of guitarists?",
      "Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to need more than four faces, probably. (Jimi) Hendrix, No. 1 for sure. No. 2 is always hotly contested: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Angus Young. I could go on and on. It\u2019s too many, way too many.",
      "Where is the most unusual place you've performed?",
      "The most unusual place I\u2019ve performed? On the baggage carousel at an airport on the little carpeted strip in between where the bags go around. Yeah, totally humiliating.",
      "What\u2019s your most fun song to perform onstage?",
      "All of them, because I feel really grateful that I don\u2019t have to do a song that I don\u2019t like. I feel really, really lucky that that\u2019s happened to me: to have such a long career and have certain songs like \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color,\u201d or \u201cSomebody Like You,\u201d or some of these songs, that I couldn\u2019t not do them. But I love them just as much as I did when I recorded them.",
      "When did your iconic hairstyle become part of your look?",
      "I've never decided to make hair a part of my look. God bless my mom. I got my mom\u2019s hair, and my dad really didn\u2019t have much, and I\u2019m grateful that I got her gene. Go, mom.",

I\u2019m just as excited to write the next song, put on the next tour, make another album \u2014 like, literally giddy with excitement to do that. That\u2019s never changed.

      "\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.",
      "Duchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.",
      "\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"",
      "Later in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.",
      "\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"",
      "\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.",
      "After Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.",
      "\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"",
      "Duchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.",
      "\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.",
      "\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Duchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.",
      "\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"",
      "Another source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.",
      "\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.",
      "\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"",
      "\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.",
      "\"The world,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.",
      "\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"",
      "\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.",
      "During their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, big deal.\u2019 And I saw it, and I must say, I was overcome,\" he tells TODAY.com in a recent interview.",

Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",

      "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut and far from the areas in southern and eastern Lebanon where the militant Hezbollah group has a major presence. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",
      "Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said the dead include nine women, and that the toll was likely to rise as rescue efforts continue.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a site where militants were operating in Jabaliya, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review.",
      "A separate strike on Sunday hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders organization that operates under the government.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in\u00a0only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said\u00a0famine is imminent in the north\u00a0or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as\u00a0the deadline approaches\u00a0for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or\u00a0risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel\u2019s ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019 attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel\u00a0has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups\u00a0have long accused\u00a0the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent.\u00a0Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and\u00a0killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s strike in Aalmat, some 25 miles north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250.\u00a0Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the fatalities were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions\u00a0have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins\u00a0and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people,\u00a0often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of\u00a0when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",

      "The diplomat noted that Qatar may resume its role if both sides reach an impasse and show genuine intent to negotiate.",
      "Under U.S. pressure, Qatari officials had warned Hamas\u2019 political bureau earlier that it was no longer welcome in the country amid frustration over stalled hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Israel, according to a senior U.S. administration official and two diplomats briefed on the matter.",

      "\u201cQatar has become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress toward a cease-fire by both Hamas and Israel,\u201d one of the diplomats told NBC News Saturday morning.",
      "Later, a diplomat added that Qatar had informed the Israelis and Hamas that \u201cas long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate. As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.\u201d",
      "The officials did not say whether Hamas had been given a deadline, how its diplomats had responded to the warning to leave, or where they would go.",
      "The move is one of multiple indications that the Biden administration is intensifying efforts to achieve a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal before leaving office.",
      "The U.S. asked Qatar to kick out Hamas about two weeks ago when the group rejected another hostage proposal after Israel killed Hamas\u00a0leader Yahya Sinwar, the senior U.S. administration official told NBC News late Friday.",
      "Qatar agreed and told Hamas\u2019 political leaders about the decision about 10 days ago, the U.S. official said.",

      "According to one of the diplomats briefed on the matter, once the Qataris had made their decision, they notified Israel and Hamas as well as the U.S. administration.",
      "\u201cAll sides were given no advance warning and were informed after the decision was made,\u201d they said.",
      "A Hamas official contacted for comment did not respond. Israeli officials were not immediately available for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Majed bin Mohammed Al Ansari, said on X that reports about the Hamas office in Doha were \"inaccurate,\" adding that the office's purpose is to be a \"channel of communication between the concerned parties.\" He characterized Qatar's efforts to mediate between the parties as \"currently stalled.\"",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has played a key role in mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, alongside Egypt and the U.S.",
      "While housing Hamas representatives in Qatar has long been considered an advantage by negotiators, the country is under growing pressure from the U.S., with the outgoing Biden administration anxious to force Hamas and Israel into a deal before leaving office.",
      "Meanwhile, Qatari leaders face the prospect of a hawkish Trump presidency and more powerful Republican lawmakers with little tolerance for rounds of unsuccessful talks or patience with the kingdom\u2019s role as a go-between for militants.",
      "The U.S. request to oust Hamas came partly because of the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and it coincided with the unsealing of indictments for Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, who is known to be living in Qatar, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The official said the U.S. is still trying to secure the release of hostages \u2014 and that the administration believes that expelling Hamas from Doha will place more pressure on the organization.",
      "\u201cQatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cHowever, following Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which killed around 1,200. Of those, about 100 remain in captivity, with a third believed to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing war, and Israeli forces have destroyed much of the blockaded enclave.",
      "The two diplomats told NBC News that Hamas was also asked to leave Qatar and relocate to Turkey in April. But after officials there failed to compel Hamas to agree to a hostage deal, that decision was quickly reversed, they said.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to bring them back to Qatar because they needed to continue the talks and couldn\u2019t do it while in Turkey,\u201d one diplomat said.",

      "Qatar has housed Hamas\u2019 political bureau for over 20 years, and before the war, provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual assistance, with the knowledge and cooperation of the Israeli government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.",

The \u201cZionist entity today in Gaza and Lebanon pierce the heart of every human being,\u201d President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the time. \u201cThis pain is even greater for those of us who consider the oppressed Palestinian people as our brothers in faith.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe show that the individuals\u2019 sexes and family relationships do not match traditional interpretations,\u201d wrote the authors of the research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cModern assumptions about gendered behaviors may not be reliable lenses through which to view data from the past,\u201d they added.",
      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",
      "\u201cThe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, professor David Reich, said in interview Thursday with the Harvard Medical School, where he lectures.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby resigned Tuesday after an independent investigation found that he failed to alert authorities about a serial physical and sexual abuser who preyed on more than 100 young boys and men at Christian holiday camps on two continents.",
      "Welby learned in 2013, shortly after taking the reins of the global Anglican church, that John Smyth had victimized about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 more in Africa over five decades, the independent Makin Review found.",
      "But the abuse allegations against Smyth weren't made public until 2017 when police, prompted by a report by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television station, launched an investigation.",
      "Welby, the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide, said in a statement he was stepping down \"in sorrow\" and \"having sought the gracious permission of His Majesty The King.\"",
      "In his resignation letter, Welby acknowledged \u201cpersonal and institutional responsibility\u201d for \u201cwrongly\u201d believing that there wasn\u2019t a need to make a formal report to police when he was first told about Smyth.",
      "He said the exact timing of his departure would be decided at a later date since \u201cit is my duty to honor my constitutional and church responsibilities.\u201d",
      "But Welby has faced mounting calls to resign since the damning, 251-page report on Smyth, a prominent lawyer who volunteered at Christian holiday camps, was published last Thursday.",
      "\u201cJohn Smyth was an appalling abuser of children and young men,\" the report stated. \"His abuse was prolific, brutal and horrific. His victims were subjected to traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks.\u201d",
      "It found that from July 2013, the Church of England knew \u201cat the highest level\u201d about Smyth and should have \u201cproperly and effectively\u201d reported him to the relevant authorities.",
      "\u201cThere was a distinct lack of curiosity shown by these senior figures and a tendency toward minimization of the matter, demonstrated by the absence of any further questioning and follow-up,\" the report stated.",
      "The independent investigators also reported that Welby and Smyth crossed paths at Christian holiday camps run by a British trust between 1975 and 1979 and exchanged Christmas cards for several years.",
      "\"He knew John Smyth from the Iwerne camps and was in John Smyth\u2019s dormitory for two camps,\" excerpts of the report that were stated. \u201cHe has described being \u2018impressed\u2019 by John Smyth and reacting to his apparent power of intellect and charismatic [in the lay sense] personality. He says that they were never close, however.\u201d",
      "Smyth was already under investigation by police in the United Kingdom when he died in 2018 at age 77 in Cape Town, South Africa.",
      "Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, second only to the archbishop of Canterbury, said Welby\u2019s resignation was \u201cthe right and honorable thing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a church, we continue to work towards and must achieve a more victim-centred and trauma-informed approach to safeguarding within the Church of England, and this must address the broader questions of culture and leadership,\" he added in a statement.",
      "Andrew Morse, who said he was abused by Smyth as a teenager, told The Guardian that Welby\u2019s resignation was \u201ca positive step in a very bleak situation that has existed ever since Smyth started beating me and my friends more than 40 years ago.\"",
      "A petition calling for Welby's resignation, created by members of the national assembly of the Church of England, had garnered over 13,000 signatures at the time of his announcement on Tuesday.",
      "When asked if Welby should resign,\u00a0British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the matter was ultimately for the Church to address but he emphasized the \u201cclearly horrific\u201d allegations of abuse, adding that it was evident the victims had been \u201cfailed very, very badly.\u201d",
      "While Welby said he wasn't made aware of Smyth's abusive behavior until 2013, the Makin Review found that back in 1982 there had been an internal investigation into Smyth and that recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa, the review found. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival less attractive this year due to a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 such as JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a\u00a0real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",
      "Since the festival began in late October, \u201cI have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the Chinese capital, Beijing.",

      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi\u2019an, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion that they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the Covid-19 pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s\u00a0recent stimulus measures\u00a0have had little impact on increasing consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round; 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival\u2019s transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before Covid-19."

      "This year is on track to be the hottest on record. Rich and poor countries alike have been challenged by extreme weather events, including\u00a0flooding disasters in Africa, coastal\u00a0Spain\u00a0and the U.S. state of\u00a0North Carolina, and drought gripping\u00a0South America,\u00a0Mexico and the\u00a0U.S. West.",
      "But even agreeing on one of COP29\u2019s first tasks has proved a challenge: setting the agenda for negotiations has been delayed for several hours.",
      "Countries were also at odds over a proposal from\u00a0China\u00a0to include trade on the COP29 agenda.",
      "Trade has gained importance as an issue for China, already facing European Union tariffs, because of\u00a0Trump\u2019s campaign promise\u00a0to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods, and 60% on Chinese goods.",

      "\u201cPeople will be saying, well, the U.S. is the second-biggest emitter. It\u2019s the biggest economy in the world ... If they don\u2019t set themselves an ambitious target, why would we?\u201d Marc Vanheukelen, the E.U.\u2019s climate ambassador from 2019 to 2023, told Reuters.",

      "The Summary",
      "A new report describes the dire state of Earth\u2019s snow and ice.Among other findings, it warns that several key climate tipping points appear more likely to be reached than previously thought.They include ice melt that could cause severe sea-level rise and the collapse of a crucial ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "A new report describes the dire state of Earth\u2019s snow and ice.",
      "Among other findings, it warns that several key climate tipping points appear more likely to be reached than previously thought.",
      "They include ice melt that could cause severe sea-level rise and the collapse of a crucial ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Venezuela lost its final glacier this year. The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing, on average, 30 million tons of ice per hour. Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \u201cDoomsday\u201d glacier because its collapse could precipitate rapid Antarctic ice loss,\u00a0may be unstoppable.",
      "These are just a few of the stark findings from more than 50 leading snow and ice scientists, which are detailed in a new report from the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative.",
      "The report summarizes the state of snow and ice in 2024: In short, experts agree, it\u2019s been a horrible year for the frozen parts of Earth, an expected result of global warming. What\u2019s more, top cryosphere scientists are growing increasingly worried that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean, is on a path toward collapse.",
      "A rapid halt to the current would cause rapid cooling in the North Atlantic, warming in the Southern Hemisphere and extreme changes in precipitation. If that happens, the new report suggests, northern Europe could cool by about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a decade.",
      "The report highlights a shift in consensus: Scientists once thought tipping points \u2014 like the collapse of AMOC \u2014 were distant or remote possibilities. Now, some of those thresholds are appearing more likely to be crossed, and with less runway to turn the situation around.",
      "\u201cThe latest science is not telling us that things are any different to what we knew before, necessarily, but it\u2019s telling us with more confidence and more certainty that these things are more likely to happen,\u201d said Helen Findlay, an author of the report and a professor and biological oceanographer at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England. \u201cThe longer we record these things, and the longer we\u2019re able to observe them and start to understand and monitor them, there\u2019s more certainty in the system and we start to really understand how these tipping points are working.\u201d",
      "Last month, 44 leading scientists wrote in an open letter to leaders of Nordic countries that the collapse of AMOC remained \u201chighly uncertain\u201d but that evidence in favor of such a collapse was mounting, and risks have been underestimated. Dramatic changes to the AMOC, they warned, would \u201clikely lead to unprecedented extreme weather\u201d and \u201cpotentially threaten the viability of agriculture in northwestern Europe.\u201d",
      "The new report similarly draws attention to the risk of AMOC collapse.",
      "Additionally, it projects that roughly two-thirds of glacier ice in the European Alps will be lost by 2050 if global greenhouse gas emissions keep their pace. Already, an estimated 10 million people are at risk of glacial outburst floods in Iceland, Alaska and Asia \u2014 a phenomenon already occurring as meltwater collapses ice dams and rapidly floods downstream. If high emissions continue, the report adds, models suggest that sea level could rise by roughly 10 feet in the 2100s, imperiling parts of many coastal cities.",
      "The report was released as world leaders gathered Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, for the United Nations\u2019 COP29 climate conference.",
      "\u201cTiming is everything,\u201d said Julie Brigham-Grette, a geosciences professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and an author of the new report.",
      "She said the group hopes to rattle world leaders to attention: \u201cThe sense of urgency couldn\u2019t be higher. We\u2019ve been talking about urgency for a decade. It almost starts to feel like a useless word. What\u2019s more than \u2018urgent?\u2019 \u2018Catastrophic?\u2019 We\u2019ve run out of ways to describe it.\u201d",
      "To date, the report says, world governments are falling short on the pledges they made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris Agreement.",
      "Even if they were on track, those commitments\u00a0are insufficient to reach global climate goals, the authors say. On paper, the world\u2019s pledges would limit the rise in global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. That\u2019s well short of the goal to cap warming at 1.5 degrees C.",
      "Global temperatures are currently on pace to rise more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), on average.",
      "\u201cI feel quite frustrated,\u201d Findlay said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand how they\u2019re missing the severity of the issue.\u201d",
      "In Baku on Monday, world leaders did agree to new rules for a global market to trade carbon credits. In a news release, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev, who has been Azerbaijan\u2019s minister of ecology and natural resources since 2018, said the agreement was a \u201cgame-changing\u201d tool to direct climate financing to the developing world.",
      "But he also acknowledged, in a speech to delegates, that the world is \u201con a road to ruin\u201d under current climate policies.",
      "That warning and the new report both come amid fears the U.S. will backslide on its climate commitments and pull out of the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump wants to remove the U.S. from the international treaty, and he began that process during his first presidential administration. President Joe Biden reversed the move in 2021.",
      "Peter Neff, a glaciologist and climate scientist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the new report, said its authors clearly communicated the scientific consensus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing surprising for a glaciologist. Across the board, there\u2019s not good news with respect to ice on Earth. It\u2019s all, for the most part, going in one direction,\u201d Neff said.",
      "But he added that he still found the report\u2019s findings to be staggering: \u201cThese documents can hit you like a ton of bricks, and that\u2019s intentional.\u201d"
