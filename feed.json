      "Five new movies opened in wide release in North American theaters this weekend.",
      "Five new movies opened wide in North American theaters this weekend including a starry spy picture from Steven Soderbergh, an A24 thriller, a Looney Tunes movie and a high concept action-comedy with \u201cThe Boys\u201d star Jack Quaid. But the myriad options did not result in box office gold. When final receipts are tallied Monday, it\u2019s likely going be the lowest-grossing weekend of the year to date with around $54 million in total ticket sales.",
      "\u201cNovocaine\u201d led the pack with $8.7 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, which was slightly lower than expected. The film starring Quaid as a man who literally can\u2019t feel pain was released by Paramount Pictures in 3,365 locations this weekend. The studio also had early access showings the weekend prior, which are included in the total.",
      "The R-rated movie, directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, got generally positive reviews with an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. Exit polls were a bit more tempered with 4/5 on PostTrak and a B CinemaScore. It also made $1.8 million from 19 international territories bringing its total weekend to $10.5 million.",
      "The Bong Joon Ho and Robert Pattinson sci-fi \u201cMickey 17 \" and the spy pic \u201cBlack Bag\u201d were neck and neck for second and third place, both reporting $7.5 million weekends. \u201cMickey 17\" had the slight edge. It's still playing in 3,807 theaters, was down a steep 60% from its opening. That brings its domestic total to $33.3 million and its global total to $90.5 million against a reported $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d the well-reviewed Soderbergh film with Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender, opened in 2,705 theaters to take third place. Audiences skewed male (56%) and over 35 (59%). The film, released by Focus Features, currently carries a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It also got a B CinemaScore.",
      "Other new openers included \u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie,\u201d an animated film starring Porky Pig and Daffy Duck originally intended for the streaming service Max, and the faith based \u201cThe Last Supper.\u201d Ketchup Entertainment handled the Looney Tunes theatrical release in 2,827 theaters where it earned $3.2 million. Pinnacle Peak Pictures released \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d in 1,575 theaters to $2.8 million in ticket sales. Both came in behind Disney and Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which earned $5.5 million in its fifth weekend in theaters.",
      "The new A24 movie, \u201cOpus,\u201d opened outside of the top 10 with an estimated $1 million from 1,764 screens. Starring Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich as a legendary pop star who has suddenly reemerged on the scene after decades away, \u201cOpus\u201d premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to generally poor reviews. It's the first film from writer-director Mark Anthony Green.",
      "After a strong start to the year in which the box office was up 22%, several slow weekends that haven\u2019t surpassed $60 million in total ticket sales have left the domestic box office at a 5% deficit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a momentum business,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019ll ratchet up with \u2018Snow White\u2019 next weekend. And the good news is we probably won\u2019t see the 50s again until August.\u201d",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",
      "1. \u201cNovocaine,\u201d $8.7 million.",
      "2. \u201cMickey 17,\u201d $7.5 million.",

      "NOME, Alaska -- Jessie Holmes, a former reality television star, won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Friday, celebrating with fist pumps to a cheering crowd and posing for photos with his two floral wreath-adorned head teammates, Hercules and Polar.",
      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s a magical feeling,\" Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this moment now. It\u2019s about all those moments along the trail.\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly amazing 10 days and I soaked in every part of it \u2014 the lows, the highs, the in-betweens. ... I\u2019m really proud of these dogs and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit,\" Holmes said.",
      "He gave a special salute to his two lead canines, Hercules, his half-sprint dog, and Polar, saying, \u201cHe's the brains behind the operation.\u201d",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive."

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A representative for the estate of actor Gene Hackman is seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports, especially photographs and police body-camera video, related to the recent deaths of Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa after their partially mummified bodies were discovered at their New Mexico home in February.",
      "Authorities last week announced Hackman died at age 95 of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 took the life of his 65-year-old wife.",
      "Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed signs of activity on Feb. 18, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm on the day he likely died. The couple's bodies weren't discovered until Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the Santa Fe home and alerted police, leaving a mystery for law enforcement and medical investigators to unravel.",
      "Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.",
      "The request, filed Tuesday, also described the couple's discrete lifestyle in Santa Fe since Hackman's retirement. The state capital city is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "The couple \"lived an exemplary private life for over thirty years in Santa Fe, New Mexico and did not showcase their lifestyle,\u201d the petition said.",
      "New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased, said Amanda Lavin, legal director at the nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government. Some medical information also is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "At the same time, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability, she said.",
      "\u201cI do think it does infringe on transparency if the court were to prohibit release of all the investigation records, including the autopsies,\u201d Lavin said Thursday. \u201cThe whole idea of those records being available is to ensure accountability in the way those investigations are done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is also a public health concern given that hantavirus was involved,\u201d Lavin said.",
      "She said the preemptive request to prevent the release of government records on constitutional grounds is unusual.",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post."

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "The Russo brothers bring Simon St\u00e5lenhag's illustrated novel \u201cThe Electric State\u201d to life in the new big budget Netflix film",
      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "There's a crackling patter to \u201cBlack Bag\u201d \u2014 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller",
      "If you\u2019re hosting a dinner for half a dozen British intelligence agents with the aim of ferreting out a mole, what should you cook?",
      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "British billionaire Ratcliffe paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in United last year and made a new stadium one of his priorities.",
      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",
      "Twickenham, which is home to the national rugby team, holds 82,500.",
      "Old Trafford is the country\u2019s biggest dedicated soccer stadium with a capacity of just over 74,000, but is dated in comparison to the likes of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, which regularly hosts NFL games.",
      "\u201cOur long-term objective as a club is to have the world\u2019s best football team playing in the world\u2019s best stadium,\" United chief executive Omar Berrada said.",
      "Managerial great Alex Ferguson said the club \"must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday morning.",
      "The 64-year-old was a respected heart surgeon who turned into a popular TV pitchman. Now he has his sights on overseeing health insurance for about 150 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or Affordable Care Act coverage.",
      "Republicans, who have coalesced around Trump's nominees for the health agencies, are likely to ask Oz about his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, including the Trump administration's focus on eliminating fraud from the $1 trillion programs.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, will question Oz's tax filings, which they say show he has used a tax code loophole to underpay taxes by thousands of dollars on Medicare, the program he'll oversee. They will also grill Oz on any cuts he would make to the health insurance coverage as well as comments on his TV show supporting privatized Medicare.",
      "The U.S. Office of Government Ethics has done an \u201cextensive review\u201d of Oz's finances, spokesman Christopher Krepich said in a statement about Oz\u2019s taxes. He added that the office has indicated \u201cany potential conflicts have been resolved and he is in compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "Oz has hawked everything from supplements to private health insurance plans on his former TV series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d which ran for 13 seasons and helped him amass a fortune.",
      "Oz\u2019s net worth is between $98 million and $332 million, according to an analysis of the disclosure, which lists asset values in ranges but does not give precise dollar figures. His most recent disclosure shows he also holds millions of dollars worth of shares in health insurance, fertility, pharmaceutical and vitamin companies. He has promised to divest from dozens of companies that would pose conflicts for him as the CMS administrator.",
      "In the job, he could wield significant power over most health companies operating in the U.S. because he can make decisions about who and what are covered by Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Oz's hearing comes as the Trump administration seeks to finalize leadership posts for the nation\u2019s top health agencies. On Thursday, Senate committees voted to advance the nominations of Marty Makary, poised to lead the Food and Drug Administration, and Jay Bhattacharya, set to helm the National Institutes for Health, for a full Senate vote. The nomination of Dave Weldon to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was abruptly withdrawn Thursday.",
      "Those men have all leaned into Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's call to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d a controversial effort to redesign the nation's food supply, reject vaccine mandates and cast doubt on some long-established scientific research.",
      "\u201cAmericans need better research on healthy lifestyle choices from unbiased scientists,\u201d Oz wrote late last year in a social media post praising Kennedy's nomination to be the nation's health secretary.",
      "This isn't Oz's first time testifying before senators. In 2014, several senators scolded him during a hearing about the questionable weight loss products he hawked on his television show.",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",
      "The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.",
      "\u201cOur picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,\u201d Yigra said. \u201cThat image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.\u201d",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",
      "Much of the funding to the Africa CDC and regional governments was lost with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate most foreign aid contracts and cut $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance abroad. Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

      "Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir analyzed data from 40,000 air quality monitoring stations in 138 countries and found that Chad, Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India had the dirtiest air. India had six of the nine most polluted cities with the industrial town of Byrnihat in northeastern India the worst.",
      "Experts said the real amount of air pollution might be far greater as many parts of the world lack the monitoring needed for more accurate data. In Africa, for example, there is only one monitoring station for every 3.7 million people.",
      "More air quality monitors are being set up to counter the issue, the report said. This year, report authors were able to incorporate data from 8,954 new locations and around a thousand new monitors as a result of efforts to better monitor air pollution.",
      "But last week, data monitoring for air pollution was dealt a blow when the U.S. State Department announced it would no longer make public its data from its embassies and consulates around the world.",
      "Breathing in polluted air over a long period of time can cause respiratory illness, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, said Fatimah Ahamad, chief scientist and air pollution expert at Malaysia-based Sunway Centre for Planetary Health. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution kills around 7 million people each year.",
      "Ahamad said much more needs to be done to cut air pollution levels. The WHO had earlier found that 99% of the world\u2019s population lives in places that do not meet recommended air quality levels.",
      "\u201cIf you have bad water, no water, you can tell people to wait for half an hour a day, the water will come. But if you have bad air, you cannot tell people to pause breathing,\u201d she said.",
      "Several cities like Beijing, Seoul, South Korea, and Rybnik in Poland have successfully improved their air quality through stricter regulations on pollution from vehicles, power plants and industry. They've also promoted cleaner energy and invested in public transportation.",
      "Another notable effort to curb severe air pollution was the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreement on transboundary haze pollution. Even though its had limited success so far, ten countries in the region pledged to work together to monitor and curb pollution from large forest fires, a common occurrence in the region during dry seasons.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said many of the regions witnessing the worst air pollution are also places where planet-heating gases are released extensively through the burning of coal, oil and gas. Slashing planet-warming emissions to slow the heating up of the planet can also improve air quality, she said.",

      "New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people in the country",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting ready to appear before Congress",
      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "Kurti\u2019s leftist Vetevendosje! has been looking for allies to form a government, a much tougher job than four years ago when he needed only three seats to pass his new Cabinet.",
      "The Central Election Commission stated late Saturday that the Vetevendosje! won 42.30% of the vote, or 48 seats in the 120-seat parliament, on Feb.9. The center-right Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, followed with 20.95%, or 24 seats, and the conservative governing Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, with 18.27%, or 20 seats. The right-wing Alliance for Kosovo\u2019s Future garnered 7.06%, or 8 seats.",
      "The commission also said the turnout was 46.54%, slightly lower than the 2021 election.",
      "Ten seats are reserved in parliament for Kosovo\u2019s Serb minority and another 10 for other minorities in the European country.",
      "To form a cabinet, Kurti needs a simple majority in parliament, or 61 votes. While campaigning, he vowed not to ally himself with either the PDK or the LDK. However, it has been over a month since the vote and if Kurti fails, the president is entitled to tap another from any of the winning parties to do the job. If the other person doesn't come through, the country goes into an early parliamentary election.",
      "Kurti has been in power since 2021, the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo\u2019s parliament completed a full four-year mandate. However, he now faces the challenge of reviving an ailing economy after the United States and the European Union, Kosovo\u2019s main supporters and contributors, have suspended their financial assistance.",
      "Meanwhile, normalizing ties with Serbia, a condition for both countries to join the EU, remains stalled.",
      "The 2026 presidential election may pose yet another challenge for Kurti; the winning party usually elects the president, which needs at least 81 votes in parliament, two-thirds of the electoral body.",
      "Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a decade since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbia and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia doesn\u2019t recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence."

      "SRINAGAR, India -- Farooq Ahmad Shaksaaz presses a button on his 1970 Sharp cassette player, and with a hefty clack the machine whirrs to life. As the Kashmiri tailor stitches, the machine crackles for a moment before Ghulam Ahmad Sofi's otherworldly voice fills his shop with verses about divine love and the pain of separation from the beloved creator of the universe.",
      "Shaksaaz, a tailor in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar, inherited his passion for local Sufi music from his grandfather along with a meticulously preserved collection of audio cassette tapes from the 1970s, which he often listens to as he works.",
      "He's part of a small, dedicated community that believes cassette tapes are the best way to listen to and archive the Sufi music of Indian-controlled Kashmir, where music inspired by local and central Asian Muslim saints has long been a deep expression of spirituality and emotion. Many people turn to the music for spiritual guidance, or seeking an escape from the region\u2019s long periods of street battles, shutdowns and security clampdowns.",
      "For decades, cassette players have carried the soul-stirring poetry of Sufi saints and the mystical melodies of Kashmiri instruments like the sarangi and santoor, and it's long been a local ritual for families to gather around the warm hum of a tape player. Even today, the region\u2019s traditional Sufi music gatherings are often recorded only on the disappearing audio format, which was widely used from the 1970s to the 1990s.",
      "While the music is increasingly available on digital formats, many Kashmiris say that it's best heard on cassette tapes.",
      "\u201cThere is something unique about this machine that for me plays recordings of spiritual guides,\u201d said Abdul Ahad, a carpet weaver. \u201cIt is a sacred ritual in itself to press the play button of a cassette player to listen to a song on spiritual moorings.\u201d",
      "Many of the most beloved albums were released by local record labels during the heyday of the audio cassette, but dedicated devotees of the genre are still bringing tape recorders to gatherings. Digital recorders are often unwelcome at these nightly music sessions, as Sufi music lovers say they blur together the distinct sounds of the different instruments.",
      "\u201cIt is a different experience to listen to music on a tape recorder,\" said Abdul Hamid Khan. \"Tapes are smooth and you can feel the sound of every instrument, you don\u2019t get that feel in these new players.\u201d",
      "Still, as tapes wear out and more music moves to digital streaming platforms and smartphones, the tactile and deeply personal listening experience of cassettes is becoming harder to keep going.",
      "Many families have been forced to part with their players due to mechanical failures, while others struggle to preserve their cherished cassette collections, some of which hold rare and irreplaceable recordings passed down through generations. Some collectors have turned to digitizing their old recordings to safeguard them for future generations.",
      "Only a few shops in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, sell tape recorders or blank tapes, and the availability of spare parts and skilled repair technicians has drastically dwindled.",
      "A handful of mechanics in the Kashmir Valley still cater to a dedicated population of Sufi music lovers, painstakingly restoring machines made by beloved Japanese brands like Sharp and Kenwood in the last century.",
      "Mohammad Ashraf Matoo, a self-taught mechanic, has spent years keeping decades-old cassette players running even as spare parts become increasingly scarce. He purchases non-functional recorders to extract usable components, and manufactures some parts himself to keep his customers' devices going. Once repaired, a well-functioning tape recorder is sold for a price between $150 and $850, depending on its brand and condition.",
      "Shaksaaz, a lifelong Sufi music devotee, called it a \u201cpersonal mission\u201d to preserve the legacy of cassette tapes.",
      "\u201cIt is a bridge to the past, a way to remain connected to our spiritual and cultural roots in this ever modernizing and digital world,\u201d he said."

      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts in foreign aid have impacted programs in northern Ivory Coast to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group",
      "KIMBIRILA-NORD, Ivory Coast -- With its tomato patches and grazing cattle, the Ivory Coast village of Kimbirila-Nord hardly looks like a front line of the global fight against extremism. But after jihadis attacked a nearby community in Mali five years ago and set up a base in a forest straddling the border, the U.S. committed to spending $20 million to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group here and in dozens of other villages.",
      "The Trump administration's sweeping foreign aid cuts mean that support is now gone, even as violence in Mali and other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara has reached record levels and sent tens of thousands refugees streaming into northern Ivory Coast.",
      "Locals worry they have been abandoned. Diplomats and aid officials said the termination of aid jeopardizes counterterrorism efforts and weakens U.S. influence in a part of the world where some countries have turned to Russian mercenaries for help.",
      "In Kimbirila-Nord, U.S. funding, among other things, helped young people get job training, built parks for cattle to graze so they are no longer stolen by jihadis on Malian territory, and helped establish an information-sharing system so residents can flag violent encounters to each other and state services.",
      "\u201cWhat attracts young people to extremists is poverty and hunger,\u201d said Yacouba Doumbia, 78-year-old chief of Kimbirila-Nord. \u201cThere was a very dangerous moment in 2020. The project came at the right time, and allowed us to protect ourselves.\u201d",
      "Over the last decade, West Africa has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have conquered large areas and killed thousands in the Sahel and have been spreading into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo.",
      "In 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Global Fragility Act that led to the initiatives in northern Ivory Coast. The U.S. goal in this area was to \u201cseize a narrowing prevention window,\u201d according to this year\u2019s congressional report about the implementation of the bipartisan legislation.",
      "Experts say local concerns help drive the popularity of extremist groups: competition for land and resources, exclusion, marginalization and lack of economic opportunities. Across the region, Islamic extremists have recruited among groups marginalized and neglected by central governments.",
      "\u201cIvory Coast is one of the few countries that still resist the terrorist threat in the Sahel,\u201d said a U.N. official working in the country who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. \u201cIf we do not continue to support border communities, a minor issue could send them into the arms of extremists.\u201d",
      "Trump issued an executive order in January directing a freeze on foreign assistance and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. He charged that much of foreign aid was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "In 2020, when the jihadis struck a Malian village 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, Kimbirila-Nord in many ways fit the description of a community susceptible to extremism.",
      "The lives of Malians and Ivorians were intertwined. People crossed the border freely, making it easy for extremists, who like residents spoke Bambara, to access Kimbirila-Nord. Many residents did not have identity cards and few spoke French, leaving them with no access to states services or official information. Different ethnic groups lived next to each other but were divided by conflicts over scarce natural resources and suspicions toward the state. And young people did not have opportunities to make money.",
      "\u201cWe were very scared\u201d when the extremists attacked, said Aminata Doumbia, the head of the village's female farmers cooperative. \u201cEveryone was just looking out for themselves.\u201d",
      "The Ivorian government runs a program that provides professional training, grants and microloans. But access is difficult in villages such as Kimbirila-Nord.",
      "Kimbirila-Nord is home to refugees from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. Sifata Berte, 23, fled there with his family two years ago from Mali. He is not eligible for the government-run program, but got training through the project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and now works as an apprentice in an iron workshop.",
      "Other things the USAID-funded project set up included a network of community radios in local languages, so people could get access to information. It also used mobile government trucks to help tens of thousands of people across the region get their identity documents. And it brought people together with microcredit cooperatives and with a special committee of ranchers and farmers that helps resolve tensions over land.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the project that we can sleep at night,\u201d Doumbia, the village chief, said. \u201cWe learned how to be together.\u201d",
      "Equal Access International, an international nonprofit, designed and implemented the U.S.-funded project.",
      "The USAID project also has been the only direct source of information on the ground in northern Ivory Coast on violent events for the U.S.-based Armed Conflict and Location & Event Data Project, the main provider of data on violence in the Sahel.",
      "Ivory Coast became known as a target for extremists in 2016, when an attack on the seaside resort of Grand Bassam killed tourists. In 2021, a string of attacks occurred near the country's northern border, but the violence has been largely contained after Ivorian authorities, Western governments and aid groups rushed into this impoverished and isolated part of the country with military build up and development projects.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. Africa Command provided over $65 million to projects in Ivory Coast, most of which \"focused on counterterrorism and border security\" in the northern part of the country, according to the group's website. The Pentagon said in a statement that it was \u201cnot aware of any budget cuts that have undermined counterterrorism training or partnership programs in Africa.\u201d",
      "Ivory Coast has the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, but according to the U.N. it remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries. Many in remote villages like Kimbirila-Nord do not have access to running water.",
      "\u201cAt first we thought that we only had to solve these problems with a military solution,\u201d Famy Rene, the prefect of Korhogo, the region\u2019s capital, said. \u201cBut we saw that this was not enough. We had to put in place programs that strengthen the resilience of the population.\u201d",
      "Residents of Kimbirila-Nord had big plans before the U.S. froze aid. The U.S. was supposed to finance the first well in the village, help create a collective farm, and expand vocational training,",
      "Now they fear they have been left alone to deal with extremists.",
      "\u201cIf you forget, they will come back,\u201d said Doumbia, the village chief. \u201cAs long as there is war on the other side of the border, we must remain on a high alert.\u201d",

      "HAVANA -- Electricity service in Cuba was gradually restored Sunday, more than 36 hours after a substation failure left the entire island in the dark.",
      "Union Electrica, the state agency responsible for the electric grid, reported that most of the capital, Havana, and eastern parts of the country had power. It expected service to return to western areas on Sunday, too.",
      "The massive blackout that began Friday night was the fourth in the last six months as a severe economic crisis plagues the Caribbean country. The Ministry of Energy and Mines attributed it to a failure at a substation in the suburbs of Havana.",
      "The latest power outage affected phone, internet and water services. Many families also could not cook because they use electric equipment to prepare their meals.",
      "Cuba suffered similar blackouts in October, November and December. The latest was the first of 2025 but in mid-February authorities suspended classes and work activities for two days due to a shortage of electricity generation that exceeded 50% in the country.",
      "The outages come as Cubans are experiencing a severe economic crisis that analysts have blamed on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a program of domestic measures that triggered inflation and, above all, the tightening of sanctions by the United States.",
      "Experts have said the electricity disruptions are a result of fuel shortages at power plants and aging infrastructure. Most plants have been in operation for more than 30 years.",
      "The government has contracted floating power generating plants from Turkey in recent months to meet peak demand, especially during the sweltering tropical summer. The government has also promised that dozens of solar power parks would begin operating in 2025.",

      "Jhoan Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all",
      "MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- Jhoan Bastidas was deported from the United States and spent 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, watched by cameras and eating small meals that left him hungry.",
      "\u201cI was locked up all day in a little room \u2014 I counted the feet: 7 wide and 13 long \u2014 without being able to do anything, without a book, looking at the walls,\u201d Bastidas, 25, said in his father\u2019s middle-class home in the western city of Maracaibo, Venezuela.",
      "Three weeks after he was returned to Venezuela under President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all \u2014 how he is back in the once-prosperous hometown that he left as a teenager; how tattoos on his chest earned him a reputation as a criminal; and how he became one of the few migrants to set foot on the naval base best known for housing terrorism suspects.",
      "Bastidas and roughly 350 other Venezuelans who migrated to the U.S. are trying to piece their lives together after they were deported to their troubled country over the past few weeks. About 180 of them spent up to 16 days at the base in Guantanamo before being flown to Honduras by U.S. authorities and, from there, to Venezuela by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "It is part of the White House\u2019s efforts to deport a record number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump\u2019s government has alleged Venezuelans sent to the naval base are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the South American country, but it has offered little evidence to back that up.",
      "\u201cIt was all very hard; all those experiences were very hard,\u201d Bastidas said.\u202f\u201cYou have to be strong in the face of all those problems, you know, but I saw so much hate.\u201d",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuela has refused to take back its own citizens from the U.S. for years, with brief, limited exceptions such as the recent flights.",
      "Over the weekend, the U.S. government transferred hundreds of immigrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador after Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to speed up deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua members. The Trump administration, however, has not provided any evidence to back up the gang-membership claim.",
      "The immigrants were transferred even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to expedite mass deportations.",
      "Bastidas, his mother and siblings left Maracaibo in 2018, one of the harshest years of the country\u2019s protracted crisis. As they tested their luck in Peru and then settled in Colombia, people living in Venezuela lost jobs, formed long lines outside near-empty grocery stores and went hungry.",
      "Their hometown saw businesses shutter and entire families sell their belongings and move away. The hourslong power outages that became everyday occurrences starting in 2019 pushed even more people to abandon Maracaibo.",
      "He set off for Texas in November 2023, bankrolled by a brother whose promise of a car and a food delivery job in Utah convinced him to migrate.",
      "Bastidas turned himself in to U.S. authorities after reaching the border with Mexico and was taken to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas. He remained there until early February, when one morning he was handcuffed, driven to an airport and put in an airplane without being told where it was headed.",
      "After the aircraft landed, fellow passengers thought they were in Venezuela, but when he reached the door and only saw \u201cgringos,\u201d Bastidas said, he concluded they were wrong. When he saw \u201cGuantanamo\u201d written on the floor, it did not mean anything to him. He had never heard that word before.",
      "When inside the cell, Bastidas said, he could never tell the time of day because its only window was a small glass panel at the top of the door looking into the building. He said he only saw sunlight every three days for an hour, which was the recreation time he was allowed to spend in what he described as a \u201ccage.\u201d",
      "Bastidas said his hands and feet were shackled whenever he left his cell, including when he went to shower every three days.\u202f At one point, he and other detainees were given small Bibles, and they began praying together, reading Scripture loudly and placing their ears against the door to hear each other.",
      "\u201cWe used to say that the one who was going to get us out was God because we didn\u2019t see any other solutions. We didn\u2019t have anyone to lean on,\u201d Bastidas added.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond\u202fto requests for comment.",
      "Trump has said he planned\u202f to send \u201cthe worst\" to the base in Cuba, including members of the Tren de Aragua. Bastidas said he is not part of the gang and believes the U.S. authorities used his tattoos to wrongly catalog him as a member of the criminal organization.",
      "When asked which tattoos he thinks authorities misjudged, his father pulled down the neck of Bastidas\u2019 white T-shirt and pointed to two black, eight-pointed stars, each inked on one side of the chest, below the collarbones.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit attempting to block further transfers to Guantanamo alleging cruelty by the guards and suicide attempts by at least three people held there.",
      "Bastidas and other Venezuelans returned to Venezuela from Guantanamo on Feb. 20. Armed state intelligence service agents dropped them off at their homes.",
      "Bastidas spent the next two weeks resting. He then began working at a hot dog stand.",
      "Abandoned storefronts and homes are everywhere in Maracaibo, which once was a magnet for immigrants looking for good-paying jobs in and around nearby oil fields. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production \u2014 and population \u2014 decline steadily.",
      "Few people might know Bastidas by name in his sweltering hometown, but practically everyone in Maracaibo knows someone who has migrated. So, news of the Venezuelans\u2019 transfer to Guantanamo was shared seemingly endlessly on social media and WhatsApp, setting off debates over their living conditions and alleged gang affiliations as well as the complex crisis that drove them to migrate in the first place.",
      "Bastidas is leaning into faith to ignore the noise and move forward.",
      "\u201cI see it as a kind of test that the Lord put me through,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has another purpose for me. It wasn\u2019t for me to be (in the U.S.), and he kept me there (in detention) for some reason.\u201d",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has fleshed out some possible missions that could be undertaken by a military support force for Ukraine that Paris and London are working to put together with other nations, in a so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d that could deploy after any ceasefire with Russia.",
      "Speaking to French media ahead of an online summit that the U.K. hosted on Saturday, Macron said the French-British blueprint doesn\u2019t aim to deploy a \u201cmass\u201d of soldiers in Ukraine and instead envisages stationing troop contingents in key locations.",
      "Macron\u2019s office said Sunday that it couldn\u2019t provide a recording of the French leader\u2019s exchange with reporters from regional French newspapers on Friday night.",
      "But according to La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi and Le Parisien, the French president spoke of participating nations each deploying several thousand troops to \u201ckey points\u201d in Ukraine. Their missions could include providing training and supporting Ukrainian defenses, to demonstrate long-term support for Kyiv, the reports quoted Macron as saying.",
      "Macron added that the proposed contingents from countries that are members of the NATO alliance would serve as \u201ca guarantee of security\u201d for Ukraine and that \u201cseveral European nations, and also non-European, have expressed their willingness to join such an effort when it is confirmed,\u201d La D\u00e9p\u00eache reported.",
      "Le Parisien cited Macron as saying that Moscow\u2019s agreement wasn't needed for such deployment. \u201cUkraine is sovereign. If it asks for Allied forces to be on its territory, it\u2019s not up to Russia to accept or not,\" he said.",
      "Following Saturday\u2019s two-hour virtual meeting, Starmer challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign up to a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine if he is serious about peace, and said allies will keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an \u201coperational phase.\u201d",
      "Around 30 leaders were involved in the call, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as well as officials from NATO and the European Union.",
      "It was the second such meeting in two weeks, meant to help Ukraine face a change of approach by the U.S. following the return of President Donald Trump, as well as gauging support for any future possible peacekeeping mission. Many more countries were involved this time than the previous meeting on March 2.",
      "According to Starmer, military planners will convene again in the U.K. on Thursday to progress practical plans to support Ukraine\u2019s future security."

      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Ordnance from Syria's 13-year conflict exploded in the coastal city of Lattakia, collapsing a building and killing more than a dozen people, the Syrian Civil Defense said Sunday.",
      "The paramedic group, known as the White Helmets, said it worked overnight, searching through debris and recovered 16 bodies, including five women and five children, and that 18 others were injured. The group and residents said the explosion occurred in a metal scrap storage space on the ground floor of the four-story building.",
      "The United Nations said in February that about a hundred have been killed from exploding ordnance during the last 13 years, adding that since the ouster of Bashar Assad in December, over 1,400 unexploded devices across Syria have been safely disposed of and 138 minefields and contaminated areas identified in Idleb, Aleppo, Hama, Deir-ez-Zor and Lattakia.",
      "Lattakia, a key port city, and Syria's coastal province recently witnessed a surge in violence, after gunmen loyal to Assad ambushed a security patrol. While the government's counter-offensive, alongside allied factions, crushed the insurgency, it led to widespread destruction and numerous cases of retaliatory attacks against members of the Alawite community, which the Assad family is part of.",

      "Since the mid-1980s, a number of organizations, primarily in northern Mexico, have launched informational campaigns and community-oriented interventions aimed at addressing drug use from a public health and social justice perspective, rather than a sec...",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Under warm strobe lights and pulsing house beats, a recent festival in Mexico City offered more than music, food and booze. Amidst the usual festival fare, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing.",
      "The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), is one of several recent efforts by Mexican civil society to reduce risk among people taking drugs. Spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization, it aims to address drug use from a public health and social justice perspective, rather than a security one.",
      "In a well-lit corner of the festival, members of the Instituto RIA used reagents and laboratory porcelain plates to test substances that some of the partygoers planned to use and recorded the data. Their analysis uses color changes to indicate what\u2019s in the drug: It can reveal the presence of adulterants but not their exact proportion.",
      "They also offered test strips that can detect the presence of fentanyl and nasal sprays of naloxone, a medication designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose.",
      "Also available were informational flyers detailing the effects of various psychoactive substances and what to do to reduce the risks associated with using them, including simple but critical measures like staying hydrated and eating well.",
      "While some partygoers seemed wary of the initiative, others approached it with curiosity.",
      "\u201c(There is) amazement, but also a little bit of fear, because there is a whole context of criminalization,\u201d said social psychology student Jessica Reyes Moreno, 27, a volunteer with Checa tu Sustancia.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users receive detailed information on what they are, about their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "When people understand that the focus is not on prohibiting but on offering information and safe, non-judgmental spaces where they can be heard, trust is built, said Reyes Moreno.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s information we should have. Because (drug use) is taboo, and if we're uninformed, we can overdose,\u201d said a 34-year-old Mexican partygoer, who requested anonymity due to his use of illicit substances.",
      "He said he feels there isn't enough information about illegal drugs in Mexico, and when there is, it's either confusing or all stigma. \"It\u2019s just \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 but there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018If you do it, take this precaution.\u2019\u201d",
      "The \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d approach sees abstinence as the solution. In contrast, harm reduction, as defined by Harm Reduction International, aims to minimize the negative health, social and legal effects of substance use by working with people without judgment or requiring them to stop using drugs.",
      "The approach focuses more on people \u2014 and their communities\u2014 than on the substance.",
      "\u201cWe never say, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t consume this,\u2019\u201d said Zara Snapp, a political scientist and director of the Instituto RIA. \u201cThe best way to reduce your risks is not to consume at all. But if you have made the decision to consume, we want you to have as much information as possible so you can take care of yourself.\u201d",
      "The prohibitionist, hardline approach of the war on drugs in Mexico has led to the perception of the user as someone who is necessarily associated with drug trafficking or criminal activities.",
      "Earlier this year, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled her government\u2019s latest anti-drug campaign, \u201cStay away from drugs. Fentanyl kills,\u201d which centers on the synthetic opioid responsible in its deadliest year for more than 70,000 overdose deaths each year in the U.S. \u2014 now down to an estimated 52,000 deaths a year.",
      "Aimed at young Mexicans, the campaign frames drug use as a public health issue, but some of the videos and glowing neon billboards show scenarios in which death and loneliness (drug use) are contrasted with life and family (not using drugs). They read, \u201cChoose to be happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that if I use drugs I won\u2019t be happy, or if I stop using drugs I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d said Lilia Pacheco, operational director of PrevenCasa A.C., a Tijuana-based organization that runs harm-reduction initiatives for opioid users, mostly deportees from the United States who report that they started using in that country.",
      "\u201cHow can we say that to someone who is using because they are cold, hungry or in withdrawal?\u201d she said.",
      "Mexico's health department did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding concerns that its latest campaign stigmatizes drug use.",
      "Dr. Carlos Magis, a professor at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University\u2019s medical school and member of a working group on opioids, said that stigma poses serious challenges. He cited examples of health workers refusing treatment without abstinence, limited access to naloxone or the scarcity of public methadone clinics.",
      "A recent report by the Mexican Observatory of Mental Health and Drug Use, found that between 2013 and 2024, 5,901 people in Mexico were treated for emergencies related to opioid use, with it trending up.",
      "PrevenCasa reduces harm not by asking users to stop using, but by showing that their lives matter by providing them with safe injection equipment, showers, toiletries and social events like Friday movie nights.",
      "\u201cThese interventions improve quality of life, unlike a sign that says \u2018fentanyl kills you,\u2019\" said Pacheco. \u201cThe right to health should be universal.\u201d",
      "Both Pacheco and Snapp emphasized that collective care is at the heart of harm reduction efforts. Whether practiced in the facilities of organizations working on the border or at electronic music festivals, the goal is to break down social isolation and fear in concrete ways.",
      "\u201cThis is a service that will save lives...it\u2019s very forward-thinking,\u201d said a 43-year-old man, who requested anonymity because he is a user of illicit substances, after members of Instituto RIA tested his ecstasy at a recent festival.",
      "He said that drug testing kits are available in the United States, where he\u2019s from, but that in his experience so far, it\u2019s something people mostly do on their own or behind closed doors.",
      "The visibility and organization of Checa tu Sustancia was a surprise to him.",
      "\u201cI feel good that I\u2019m not doing anything wrong. I\u2019m just here to have fun, but now with peace of mind,\u201d he said with a smile. He then rejoined his friends and disappeared into the dancing crowd.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will seek to dismiss the head of the internal security service",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will seek to dismiss the head of the internal security service this week, deepening a power struggle focused largely on who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s effort to remove Ronen Bar as director of the Shin Bet comes as the security service investigates close aides of the prime minister. Netanyahu said he has had \u201congoing distrust\u201d with Bar, and \u201cthis distrust has grown over time.\u201d",
      "Bar responded by saying he planned to continue in the post for the near future, citing \u201cpersonal obligations\u201d to finish \u201csensitive investigations,\" free the remaining hostages in Gaza and prepare potential successors.",
      "Bar also criticized Netanyahu\u2019s expectation of a personal loyalty that contradicts the public interest. But he emphasized that he would respect any legal decision regarding his tenure.",
      "Israel\u2019s attorney general said Netanyahu must clarify the legal basis for his decision before taking any action.",
      "The Shin Bet is responsible for monitoring Palestinian militant groups, and recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. It also criticized Netanyahu, saying failed government policies helped create the climate that led to it.",
      "While the army concluded in a recent report that it underestimated Hamas\u2019 capabilities, Shin Bet said it had a \u201cdeep understanding of the threat.\u201d In veiled criticism of the government, the agency said its attempts to thwart the threat were not implemented.",
      "\u201cThe investigation reveals a long and deliberate disregard from the political leadership from the organization\u2019s warnings,\u201d Bar's statement said.",
      "Netanyahu has resisted calls for an official state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack and has tried to blame the failures on the army and security agencies. In recent months, a number of senior security officials, including a defense minister and army chief, have been fired or forced to step down.",
      "Bar has been one of the few senior security officials since the Oct. 7 attack to remain in office.",
      "If successful in removing him, Netanyahu would be expected to appoint a loyalist in his place, slowing any momentum for the commission of inquiry. The prime minister said removing him would help Israel \u201cachieve its war goals and prevent the next disaster.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s proposed resolution for Bar\u2019s dismissal would need the approval of parliament, the Knesset, and it is likely he has support to pass it.",
      "However, a personnel decision of this magnitude must get the attorney general\u2019s approval, said Amichai Cohen, a senior research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute think tank.",
      "In her letter to Netanyahu warning he could not go ahead without clarification, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara added that he should \u201cpay attention to the fact that the role of the Shin Bet is not to serve the personal trust of the prime minister,\u201d according to a statement from her office.",
      "The two have a combative relationship, with the prime minister accusing Baharav-Miara of meddling in government decisions. Earlier this month, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, one of Netanyahu\u2019s biggest supporters, initiated the process of firing her.",
      "Cohen also called Netanyahu\u2019s decision \u201cvery problematic.\" He said it illustrates the conflict of interest regarding the Shin Bet findings around the Oct. 7 attack and the agency's investigations into connections between the prime minister\u2019s office and Qatar, a mediator in talks on the war in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu is angry that the Shin Bet is investigating members of his staff for their dealings with Qatar.",
      "Eli Feldstein, Netanyahu\u2019s former spokesperson, was reported by Israel\u2019s Channel 12 to have worked for a Doha-based firm that recruited Israeli journalists to write pro-Qatar stories. Israel\u2019s left-leaning daily, Haaretz, has reported that two other Netanyahu staffers, Jonatan Urich and Yisrael Einhorn, allegedly built a campaign to bolster Qatar\u2019s image ahead of the 2022 World Cup there.",
      "The Shin Bet, and Bar, have been closely involved with the Gaza hostage negotiations. Netanyahu recently removed Bar from the negotiating team and replaced him with a loyalist, Cabinet minister Ron Dermer. Israeli media have reported on policy differences between the negotiators, who have pushed for a hostage deal, and Netanyahu, who threatens to resume the war.",
      "The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good-governance civil society group, called Netanyahu\u2019s announcement a \u201cdeclaration of war on the rule of law\u201d and claimed that he does not have the authority to take the step against Bar because of the investigations into his office.",
      "The group's chair, Eliad Shraga, called the announcement unlawful and \u201can extreme example of conflict of interest.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid said he would appeal Bar\u2019s dismissal, calling the resolution \u201cshameful\u201d and politically motivated.",
      "Since Netanyahu was indicted on corruption charges in 2019, he has claimed to be the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy by the media, judiciary and other unelected civil servants.",

      "Sexual assault is a constant risk for many women in South Sudan",
      "JUBA, South Sudan -- After being gang-raped by armed men while collecting firewood, the 28-year-old tried in vain to get help. Some clinics were closed, others told her to return later and she had no money to access a hospital.",
      "Five months after the assault, she lay on a mat in a displacement camp in South Sudan's capital, rubbing her swollen belly. \u201cI felt like I wasn't heard ... and now I'm pregnant,\u201d she said. The Associated Press does not identify people who have been raped.",
      "Sexual assault is a constant risk for many women in South Sudan. Now one aid group is trying to bridge the gap with technology, to find and help survivors more quickly. But it's not easy in a country with low connectivity, high illiteracy and wariness about how information is used.",
      "Five months ago, an Israel-based organization in South Sudan piloted a chatbot it created on WhatsApp. It prompts questions for its staff to ask survivors of sexual assault to anonymously share their experiences. The information is put into the phone while speaking to the person and the bot immediately notifies a social worker there's a case, providing help to the person within hours.",
      "IsraAID said the technology improves communication. Papers can get misplaced and information can go missing, said Rodah Nyaduel, a psychologist with the group. When colleagues document an incident, she's notified by phone and told what type of case it is.",
      "Tech experts said technology can reduce human error and manual file keeping, but organizations need to ensure data privacy.",
      "\u201cHow do they intend to utilize that information, does it get circulated to law enforcement, does that information cross borders. Groups need to do certain things to guarantee how to safeguard that information and demonstrate that,\u201d said Gerardo Rodriguez Phillip, an AI and technology innovation consultant in Britain.",
      "IsraAID said its data is encrypted and anonymized. It automatically deletes from staffers' phones. In the chatbot's first three months in late 2024, it was used to report 135 cases.",
      "When the 28-year-old was raped, she knew she had just a few days to take medicine to help prevent disease and pregnancy, she said.",
      "One aid group she approached scribbled her information on a piece of paper and told her to return later to speak with a social worker. When she did, they said they were busy. After 72 hours, she assumed it was pointless. Weeks later, she found she was pregnant.",
      "IsraAID found her while doing door-to-door visits in her area. At first, she was afraid to let them put her information into their phone, worried it would be broadcast on social media. But she felt more comfortable knowing the phones were not personal devices, thinking she could hold the organization accountable if there were problems.",
      "She's one of tens of thousands of people still living in displacement sites in the capital, Juba, despite a peace deal ending civil war in 2018. Some are afraid to leave or have no homes to return to.",
      "The fear of rape remains for women who leave the camps for firewood or other needs. Some told the AP about being sexually assaulted. They said there are few services in the camp because of reduced assistance by international aid groups and scant government investment in health. Many can't afford taxis to a hospital in town.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID funding during a 90-day review period is exacerbating the challenges. Aid groups have closed some services including psychological support for women, affecting tens of thousands of people.",
      "Technology isn't widely used by aid groups focused on gender-based violence in South Sudan. Some organizations say that, based on survivors' feedback, the ideal app would allow people to get help remotely.",
      "Stigma surrounding sexual assault further complicates efforts to get help in South Sudan. It\u2019s especially hard for young girls who need to get permission to leave their homes, said Mercy Lwambi, gender-based violence lead at the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\"They want to talk to someone faster than a physical meeting,\u201d she said.",
      "But South Sudan has one of the lowest rates of mobile access and connectivity in the world, with less than 25% of market penetration, according to a report by GSMA, a global network of mobile operators. People with phones don't always have internet access, and many are illiterate.",
      "\"You have to be thinking, will this work in a low-tech environment? What are the literacy rates? Do they have access to devices? If so, what kind? Will they find it engaging, will they trust it, is it safe?\u201d said Kirsten Pontalti, a senior associate at Proteknon Foundation for Innovation and Learning, an international organization focused on advancing child protection.",
      "Pontalti has piloted two chatbots, one to help youth and parents better access information about sexual reproductive health and the other for frontline workers focused on child protection during COVID.",
      "She said technology focused on reporting abuse should include an audio component for people with low literacy and be as low-tech as possible.",
      "Some survivors of sexual assault say they just want to be heard, whether by phone or in person.",
      "One 45-year-old man, a father of 11, said it took years to seek help after being raped by his wife after he refused to have sex and said he didn't want more children they couldn't afford to support.",
      "It took multiple visits by aid workers to his displacement site in Juba before he felt comfortable speaking out.",
      "\u201cOrganizations need to engage more with the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they hadn't shown up, I wouldn't have come in.\"",

      "The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 31 people, including women and children, and wounded over 100.

      "Social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",
      "___",
      "Illustrations are based on hundreds of videos posted on TikTok examined by the AP that advertise travel to the U.S. to migrants. Videos are often laced with emojis, make bold promises of success and promise safe travel."

      "The European Union is hosting a donor conference to garner support for a peaceful transition in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union hosts a donor conference for Syria on Monday to muster support to ensure a peaceful transition after President Bashar Assad was ousted by an insurgency last December.",
      "Ministers and representatives from Western partners, as well as Syria\u2019s regional neighbors, other Arab countries and U.N. agencies will take part in the one-day meeting in Brussels which will be chaired by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.",
      "Syria will attend the conference \u2014 the ninth edition of its kind \u2014 for the first time, and will be represented by Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani. The event was organized in haste by the EU to try to take advantage of the change sweeping the country.",
      "The gathering comes at a precarious time. Syria's new leaders are trying to consolidate control over territory that was divided into de facto mini-states during nearly 14 years of civil war and to rebuild the country\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The United Nations in 2017 estimated it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria, while experts say that number could reach at least $400 billion.",
      "The prospects of economic recovery have been hampered by harsh Western sanctions that were imposed during Assad\u2019s rule and largely have not been lifted.",
      "The interim government will likely be looking to the Brussels conference to shore up its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community in hopes that the sanctions will be lifted, while also seeking short-term aid.",
      "But the EU in particular is in a quandary as not all has gone well recently.",
      "Last week, an ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to Assad triggered clashes. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks -- primarily targeting members of Assad\u2019s Alawite minority sect -- that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days.",
      "In a statement, the EU called \u201cfor the full respect of Syria\u2019s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,\u201d saying that it will only support \u201ca peaceful and inclusive transition, away from malign foreign interference, which guarantees the rights of all Syrians without distinction of any kind.\u201d",
      "Syria is also on the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign ministers that Kallas will chair separately Monday. The 27-nation bloc has begun to ease energy, transport and financial sector sanctions to encourage the new authorities, but remains wary.",
      "The country\u2019s interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of Syria since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency against Assad.",
      "Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now interim president, and on Thursday he signed a temporary constitution that leaves Syria under Islamist rule for five years during a transitional phase.",
      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of more than 50 years, religious and ethnic minorities are skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new leadership to assert control over their areas.",
      "The EU can reintroduce the sanctions if things do not go to the liking of Western backers. At the same time, Syria's economy, infrastructure and institutions lie in tatters. As a failed state it could become another haven for extremists.",
      "People must make do with only a few hours of electricity each day, water supplies are unreliable and often unsafe, unemployment runs to 80% or 90%, and destruction is widespread. Many government employees and experts needed to rebuild fled after the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapsed into conflict and authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency said that last year some 7 million people had left their homes but remained in Syria. More than 4.7 million refugees are registered in neighboring countries, most in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Since Assad\u2019s fall though, almost 302,000 have returned.",
      "Despite the challenges, U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who will attend the conference, is upbeat. \u201cIt is now easier for us to operate in Syria and across Syria than it was under the Assad regime,\u201d Fletcher told reporters last week.",
      "\u201cI had excellent conversations with the caretaker authorities,\u201d he said, noting that al-Shibani in particular had helped to keep border crossings open.",
      "While the aim of Monday's conference is to generate aid pledges, it\u2019s also focused on meeting Syria\u2019s economic needs, and that requires calm. Infrastructure, health and education must be scaled up. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living.",

      "\u201cIt wasn't very successful before we met Krakakoa,\u201d Santoso said. \u201cBut then, we received training ... things are much better.\u201d",
      "Krakakoa has trained more than 1,000 cocoa farmers in Indonesia according to its founder and CEO, Sabrina Mustopo. The company also provides financial support.",
      "Santoso and other farmers in Sumatra said the partnership helped them to form a cooperative provides low-interest loans to farmers, with interest paid back into the cooperative rather than to banks outside of the community.",
      "Cocoa farmers who need bigger loans from government-owned banks also benefit from partnering with businesses, as the guaranteed buyer agreements can provide collateral needed to get loans approved, said Armin Hari, a communications manager at the Cocoa Sustainability Partnership, a forum for public-private collaboration for cocoa development in Indonesia.",
      "Dozens of other businesses, the government and nongovernmental organizations and cooperatives are also working with cocoa farmers to better cope with climate change, benefiting thousands, Hari said. He pointed to a collaboration between Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Agency and the local division of international chocolate maker Mars, which have released a new variant of cocoa that produces more pods per tree.",
      "Challenges still remain, said Rajendra Aryal, the FAO's country director for Indonesia. Fewer people see cocoa farming as a lucrative business and instead are planting other crops such as palm oil. And many small-scale farmers still cannot get loans, he said.",
      "But Aryal said he hopes that continued collaboration between farmers and others will help.",
      "\u201cIf we can look at the major issues these (farmers) are facing ... I think this sector could be, again, very attractive to the farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the challenges in Indonesia, I see that there are opportunities.\"",

      "Social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",
      "___",
      "Illustrations are based on hundreds of videos posted on TikTok examined by the AP that advertise travel to the U.S. to migrants. Videos are often laced with emojis, make bold promises of success and promise safe travel.",

      "The jury will deliberate after the closing arguments and jury instructions. Nine jurors and two alternates have heard the case.",
      "North Dakota District Court Judge James Gion told the jury last month when the trial began, \u201cYou are the judges of all questions of fact in this case,\u201d and to \u201cbase your verdict on the evidence.\u201d",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access alleged defamation, trespass, nuisance and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, its American branch Greenpeace USA, and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. The pipeline company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline and its Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe for years has opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline has transported oil since mid-2017.",
      "Trey Cox, an attorney for the pipeline company, previously said Greenpeace \u201cplanned, organized and funded a game plan to stop construction\u201d of the pipeline, \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d",
      "Cox also alleged Greenpeace paid outsiders to come into the area to protest, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue statements to stop the line from being built.",
      "He said a letter signed by leaders of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA and sent to Energy Transfer's banks contained an allegedly defamatory statement that the company desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\u201d and the company lost half its banks, Cox said.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech."

    "story": [
      "In the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea, people have long feared crocodiles",
      "BUDONG-BUDONG, Indonesia -- Nearly seven months after a crocodile attack almost took her life, Munirpa walked to the estuary outside her home with her husband and her children, ready to brave a reenactment.",
      "Munirpa, who like many Indonesians only uses one name, recounted how one early morning in August, she threw her household garbage into a creek about 50 meters (164 feet) away from her house, as she normally would.",
      "She didn't see what was coming next.",
      "By the time she realized a crocodile had attacked her, the four-meter-long (13-foot) beast had already sunk its teeth into most of her body, sparing only her head. She fought hard, trying to jab its eyes. Her husband, hearing her screams, ran over and tried to pull her by the thigh out of the crocodile's jaws. A tug-of-war ensued; the reptile whipped him with its tail. Fortunately, he saved Munirpa in time, eventually dragging her out of the crocodile's grip.",
      "People have long feared the ancient predators in the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea. For Munirpa, 48, that fear turned into a brutal reality when she became one of nearly 180 recorded crocodile attack victims in Indonesia last year. Residents like her are learning to coexist with the crocodiles, a legally protected species in Indonesia, as they balance conservation with looking out for their safety. But as attacks rise, several residents and experts have called for better government interventions to stop the problem from getting even worse.",
      "Following the attack, Munirpa was hospitalized for a month and has had two surgeries. By February this year, her fear was still clearly visible, as were the scars on her legs and thighs.",
      "\u201cI am so scared. I don\u2019t want to go to the beach. Even to the back of the house, I don\u2019t dare to go,\" said Munirpa. \u201cI am traumatized. I asked my children not to go to the river, or to the backyard, or go fishing.\"",
      "In the villages surrounding the Budong-Budong River, like Munirpa's, crocodiles have become a daily topic of conversation. Their presence has become so common that warning signs now mark the areas where they lurk, from the river mouth to the waterways which were once a popular swimming spot for children.",
      "In 2024, there were 179 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the highest number of crocodile attacks in the world, with 92 fatalities, according to CrocAttack, an independent database. Social media videos showing crocodile appearances and attacks in Sulawesi and other regions in Indonesia are also on the rise.",
      "The increase in attacks began about 12 years ago with the rise of palm oil plantations around the river mouth, said 39-year-old crocodile handler Rusli Paraili. Some companies carved artificial waterways, linking them to the larger part of the Budong-Budong River. That was when the crocodiles started straying, leaving the river and creeping to nearby residential areas, such as fish and shrimp ponds, he explained.",
      "Palm oil plantations now dominate the landscape in West Sulawesi, from the mountains to the coast, and patrolling for crocodiles has become part of people's daily routine. When residents check the water pumps in their ponds, they have no choice but to keep out an eye for the beasts \u2014 flashlights in hand, scouring up, down and across canals and waterways \u2014 resigned to the uneasy reality of sharing their home with a predator.",
      "The saltwater crocodile has been a legally protected species in Indonesia since 1999, making it an animal that cannot be hunted freely. As a top predator, there is also no population control in nature.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, said that while the law protects crocodiles from being killed, the rise in attacks is a major concern. In response, he's taken care of some of the crocs in a specially-designed farm away from human populations. He's received some financial support from the government and community donations, as well as support from palm oil companies for the last five years.",
      "The farm has four ponds and around 50 reptiles. Some have names: Tanker, the largest, shaped like a ship, or Karossa, named after the sub-district the animal was caught after fatally attacking someone.",
      "When funds run low, he uses his own money to ensure they\u2019re fed, at least once every four days.",
      "Amir Hamidy, who studies reptiles at the National Research and Innovation Agency, worries the rise in attacks indicates that crocodile numbers are becoming far too dangerous. Hamidy supports better population control.",
      "Being a protected species \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the population cannot be reduced when it is at a level that is indeed unsafe,\" he said.",
      "Around a year ago in Tumbu village, Suardi, who goes by one name, was harvesting coconuts when they fell into the river. When he went to retrieve them, he was attacked by a crocodile he initially didn't notice. He's since made a full recovery.",
      "Still, the experience has made him more cautious. \u201cYes, I am worried. But what else can we do,\" Suardi said. \u201cThe important thing is that we are careful enough.\u201d",
      "Along with Munirpa, Suardi is one of 10 people in the region who was attacked by a crocodile last year. Three of those attacked were killed.",
      "Suyuti Marzuki, who's head of West Sulawesi Marine and Fisheries Agency, said the crocodile habitat shift is making people's everyday activities \u2014 like harvesting coconuts, fishing or even disposing of garbage like Munirpa \u2014 very risky.",
      "Marzuki said the government is looking at possible options that can provide both safety and economic alternatives for residents.",
      "While he acknowledged that crocodile population numbers and ecosystems need to be protected, Marzuki also raised the possibility of bolstering the local economy through the crocodile skin trade. That industry is controversial because of conservation and animal welfare issues.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, also urged serious government interventions.",
      "\"This is a matter of human lives. So when the government is not serious, then our brothers and sisters in the future \u2014 in 5 or 15 years \u2014 there will be even more who will die from being attacked by crocodiles,\u201d he said.",
      "Residents like Munirpa and Suardi are waiting for more immediate and realistic steps from the authorities to ensure their community's and families' safety.",
      "\u201cIt is enough that I've been bitten by a crocodile,\" Munirpa said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen to my children.\u201d",

      "Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday.",
      "The bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.",

Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.",
      "In the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.",
      "\u201cA shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cDonald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\u201d",
      "Passage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats \u2014 something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past."

      "A groundbreaking climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, as Peruvian farmer Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya challenges German energy giant RWE",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- As a crucial climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, experts say the case brought by Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya against German energy giant RWE could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the first cases of its kind \u2014 a case brought by someone directly affected by climate change against a major greenhouse gas emitter \u2014 that has made it all the way to trial,\u201d said Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and an adviser to the non-profit Germanwatch, which has been advising Lliuya.",
      "Lliuya\u2019s lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and painful to see the glaciers melting,\u201d Lliuya, 45, told Associated Press in a video call from Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of concern from people in my community about the future, about the issue of water, because all the rivers that come down from the mountains are used for farming.\u201d",
      "Walker-Crawford said of all these cases around the world, this is the one that\u2019s gone the furthest.",
      "\u201cIt has already set a partial precedent in that the courts found it admissible in 2017, which means that the judges said the case is solid in legal terms,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the court is hearing evidence, and we\u2019ll see whether the company\u2019s responsibility can be proven in this specific case.\u201d",
      "Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, says the reason why the case is so significant is not the decision itself or the amount of damages sought, but the precedent it would set.",
      "\u201cIf we could use tort law to say that any fossil fuel corporation that has contributed significantly to climate change can be held liable for climate-related costs in proportion to their emissions, it could open the door for many similar cases worldwide,\u201d he said.",
      "The case could be \u201ca game changer\u201d, according to Murray Worthy, from Zero Carbon Analytics, a research group on climate change.",
      "\u201cThis case is absolutely crucial,\" Worthy said. \u201cWhile this is just one case focused on this one place in Peru, the wider implications are huge. The costs and damages from climate change could run to tens of trillions of dollars a year, and if fossil fuel companies at large are found to be responsible for those and need to pay those costs, it would completely change the finances and outlook for the entire fossil fuel industry.\u201d",
      "RWE is one of Germany\u2019s largest energy companies, historically recognized as a major producer of electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "RWE says the lawsuit is legally inadmissible and that it sets a dangerous precedent by holding individual emitters accountable for global climate change.",
      "\u201cIn our view, there is no legal basis for holding individual issuers liable for global phenomena such as climate change. Due to the large number of global emissions of greenhouse gases from both natural and human sources, as well as the complexity of the climate, it is not possible, in our opinion, to legally attribute specific effects of climate change to a single issuer,\u201d the company said in response to questions posed by AP.",
      "The company insists climate solutions should be addressed through state and international policies, not the courts.",
      "Walker-Crawford said the court is entering the evidence-gathering phase, examining whether Lliuya's home actually faces a significant risk of flooding.",
      "\u201cIf the court decides that the risk is high enough, it will then assess whether RWE\u2019s emissions can be scientifically linked to that risk,\u201d he said.",
      "Regardless of the case\u2019s final outcome, Walker-Crawford said it\u2019s likely to reinforce the legal foundation for future lawsuits.",
      "\u201cEven if the specific risk in this case isn\u2019t deemed high enough, the precedent that companies can be held liable for their climate impacts would still stand,\u201d he said.",
      "The case\u2019s outcome could also have financial repercussions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already starting to see the impact of climate litigation on financial markets,\u201d Walker-Crawford said. \u201cResearch has shown that when climate cases against corporations move past major hurdles, it negatively affects the stock market value of the companies being sued. Investors are starting to take note of the significant financial liability climate litigation can pose.\u201d",
      "Lliuya, who also works as a mountain guide for tourists, said he started the lawsuit with little hope. Ten years on, that hope has grown.",
      "\u201cWhen the German judges visited my home and the lake in 2022, it gave me hope \u2014 hope that our voices were being heard and that justice might be possible,\" he said. \u201cWhatever the outcome, we have come a long way and I feel good about that,\u201d he said.",
      "The hearing will begin Monday.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The replacements for NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday night, paving the way for the pair\u2019s return after nine long months.",
      "Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams need SpaceX to get this relief team to the space station before they can check out. Arrival is set for late Saturday night.",
      "NASA wants overlap between the two crews so Wilmore and Williams can fill in the newcomers on happenings aboard the orbiting lab. That would put them on course for an undocking next week and a splashdown off the Florida coast, weather permitting.",
      "The duo will be escorted back by astronauts who flew up on a rescue mission on SpaceX last September alongside two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.",
      "Reaching orbit from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the newest crew includes NASA\u2019s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, both military pilots; and Japan\u2019s Takuya Onishi and Russia\u2019s Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint, after springing Wilmore and Williams free.",
      "\u201cSpaceflight is tough, but humans are tougher,\" McClain said minutes into the flight.",
      "As test pilots for Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched from Cape Canaveral on June 5. A series of helium leaks and thruster failures marred their trip to the space station, setting off months of investigation by NASA and Boeing on how best to proceed.",
      "Eventually ruling it unsafe, NASA ordered Starliner to fly back empty last September and moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight due back in February. Their return was further delayed when SpaceX\u2019s brand new capsule needed extensive battery repairs before launching their replacements. To save a few weeks, SpaceX switched to a used capsule, moving up Wilmore and Williams\u2019 homecoming to mid-March.",
      "Already capturing the world\u2019s attention, their unexpectedly long mission took a political twist when President Donald Trump and SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk vowed earlier this year to accelerate the astronauts\u2019 return and blamed the former administration for stalling it.",
      "Retired Navy captains who have lived at the space station before, Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly stressed that they support the decisions made by their NASA bosses since last summer. The two helped keep the station running \u2014 fixing a broken toilet, watering plants and conducting experiments \u2014 and even went out on a spacewalk together. With nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for women: the most time spent spacewalking over a career.",
      "A last-minute hydraulics issue delayed Wednesday's initial launch attempt. Concern arose over one of the two clamp arms on the Falcon rocket\u2019s support structure that needs to tilt away right before liftoff. SpaceX later flushed out the arm's hydraulics system, removing trapped air.",
      "The duo's extended stay has been hardest, they said, on their families \u2014 Wilmore\u2019s wife and two daughters, and Williams\u2019 husband and mother. Besides reuniting with them, Wilmore, a church elder, is looking forward to getting back to face-to-face ministering and Williams can\u2019t wait to walk her two Labrador retrievers.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate all the love and support from everybody,\u201d Williams said in an interview earlier this week. \u201cThis mission has brought a little attention.

    "story": [
      "Florida\u2019s citrus growers are struggling to survive the one-two punch of hurricanes and disease",
      "LAKE WALES, Fla. -- As Trevor Murphy pulls up to his dad's 20-acre (8-hectare) grove in one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, he points to the cookie-cutter, one-story homes encroaching on the orange trees from all sides.",
      "\u201cAt some point, this isn't going to be an orange grove anymore,\" Murphy, a third-generation grower, says as he gazes at the rows of trees in Lake Wales, Florida. \"You look around here, and it's all houses, and that's going to happen here.\u201d",
      "Polk County, which includes Lake Wales, contains more acres of citrus than any other county in Florida. And in 2023, more people moved to Polk County than any other county in the country.",
      "Hit in recent years by hurricanes and citrus greening disease, which slowly kills the trees, many growers are making the difficult decision to sell orange groves that have been in their families for generations to developers building homes to house the growing population.",
      "Others, like Murphy, are sticking it out, hoping to survive until a bug-free tree or other options arrive to repel the disease or treat the trees.",
      "When Hurricane Irma blasted through the state's orange belt in 2017, Florida's signature crop already had been on a downward spiral for two decades because of the greening disease. Next came a major freeze and two more hurricanes in 2022, followed by two hurricanes last year. A tree that loses branches and foliage in a hurricane can take three years to recover, Murphy said.",
      "Those catastrophes contributed to a 90% decline in orange production over the past two decades. Citrus groves in Florida, which covered more than 832,00 acres (336,698 hectares) at the turn of the century, populated scarcely 275,000 acres (111,288 hectares) last year, and California has eclipsed Florida as the nation's leading citrus producer.",
      "\u201cLosing the citrus industry is not an option. This industry is ... so ingrained in Florida. Citrus is synonymous with Florida,\u201d Matt Joyner, CEO of trade association Florida Citrus Mutual told Florida lawmakers recently.",
      "Nevertheless, Alico Inc., one of Florida\u2019s biggest growers, announced this year that it plans to wind down its citrus operations on more than 53,000 acres (21,000 hectares), saying its production has declined by almost three-quarters in a decade.",
      "That decision hurts processors, including Tropicana, which rely on Alico\u2019s fruit to produce orange juice and must now operate at reduced capacity. Orange juice consumption in the U.S. has been declining for the past two decades, despite a small bump during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A prominent growers group, the Gulf Citrus Growers Association, closed its doors last year.",
      "Pressure on citrus farming is also growing from one of the state's other biggest industries: real estate.",
      "Florida expanded by more than 467,000 people last year to 23 million people, making it the third largest state in the nation. And more homes must be built to house that ever-growing population.",
      "Some prominent, multi-generational citrus families each have been putting hundreds of acres (hectares) of groves up for sale for millions of dollars, or as much as $25,000 an acre.",
      "Murphy owns several hundred acres (hectares) of groves and says he has no plans to abandon the industry, though last year he closed a citrus grove caretaking business that managed thousands of acres for other owners.",
      "However, he also has a real estate license, which is useful given the amount of land that is changing hands. He recently sold off acres in Polk County to a home developer, and has used that money to pay off debt and develop plans to replant thousands of trees in more productive groves.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that we\u2019re at the bottom, and we\u2019re starting to climb back up that hill,\u201d Murphy says.",
      "A whole ecosystem of businesses dependent on Florida citrus is at risk if the crops fail, including 33,000 fulltime and part-time jobs and an economic impact of $6.8 billion in Florida alone. Besides growers, there are juice processors, grove caretakers, fertilizer sellers, packing houses, nurseries and candy manufacturers, all hoping for a fix for citrus greening disease.",
      "Tom Davidson, whose parents founded Davidson of Dundee Citrus Candy and Jelly Factory in Lake Wales in 1966, says the drop in citrus production has impacted what flavor jellies the business is able to produce and the prices it charges to customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that the scientists can get this figured out so we can we can get back to what we did,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "Researchers have been working for eight years on a genetically modified tree that can kill the tiny insects responsible for citrus greening. The process involves inserting a gene into a citrus tree that produces a protein that can kill baby Asian citrus psyllids by making holes in their guts, according to Lukasz Stelinski, an entomology professor at the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' Citrus Research and Education Center.",
      "It could be at least three years before bug-resistant trees can be planted, leaving Florida growers looking for help from other technologies. They include planting trees inside protective screens and covering young trees with white bags to keep out the bugs, injecting trees with an antibiotic, and finding trees that have become resistant to greening through natural mutation and distributing them to other groves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a Lions fan before the Detroit Lions started to win games,\u201d Stelinski says. \u201cI'm hoping that we are making that turnaround.\u201d",

      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \u201cget a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\u201cTry saying something like, \u2018I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I\u2019m entitled to under the law,\u2019\u201d Ba\u00f1ez said. \u201c\u2018Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower\u2019s financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\u201cYou can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\u201d she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was a less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\u201cIt's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\u201d said Fugate, 42. \u201cAnd it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\u201d",
      "As of February, Fugate notified that her application was received and she had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\u201cAnd when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\u201d she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don\u2019t do it for the glory,\u201d she said. \u201cI've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\u201d",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\u201cI was months away from ending this nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think that's going to happen. I\u2019m kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re dealing with the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s absolutely scary.\u201d",

There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d He then added, \u201cIt takes a little time. It takes a little time.\u201d",

      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate its businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",

      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled Japan for Lebanon.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Nishida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",

And I think the market was going to go very, very bad. If anything, I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessmen. They're not investing because of what I've done.\u201d",
      "On whether he thinks there will be a recession: \u201cI don't see it at all. I think this country's going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater. Remember, Trump is always right.\u201d"

      "Steve Kerr became the Warriors' regular-season victory leader, passing late Hall of Famer Al Attles with his 558th victory in his 11th season. He was recognized on the scoreboard after the final buzzer followed by congratulations from some of his coaching colleagues.",

      "Despite it all, the Los Angeles Marathon's Legacy Runners have stuck to their mission: finish the race.",
      "On Sunday, the group of 92 marathoners, including 10 women, marked their 40th LA Marathon, participating in the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race every year since the city's iconic event began in 1986.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re legacy runners, we just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d 77-year-old Lou Briones said.",
      "Briones even has finished the race on crutches after surgery. Since getting both knees replaced, he walks the race.",
      "\u201cYou gotta do it,\u201d Briones said. \u201cNo matter what the conditions are, you gotta be there at the starting line on race day.\u201d",
      "When Briones and others gathered at the starting line for the first LA marathon, President Ronald Reagan had just been reelected and few weeks prior the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, shocking the country. Tom Bradley was serving as the first Black mayor of Los Angeles and the city was grappling with the spread of HIV/AIDS.",
      "Los Angeles was inspired to start its own marathon after the success of hosting the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, much like the beginning of the Boston Marathon in 1897 after the first marathon competition was held in the 1896 Summer Olympics. Los Angeles is now preparing to host its next Olympics in 2028.",
      "Five years after the LA Marathon started, event organizers began recognizing runners who had completed every race with a plaque. They continued to hold celebrations for the dedicated runners every five years.",
      "Around the 15th year, Briones decided he wanted to formalize the group. He and a friend printed out stickers with an email address and brought them to the marathon in 2002.",
      "\u201cWe went to the race and we just started yelling out,\u201d Briones said. \u201cWe\u2019d stick it right on their bib, and then after the race, most of them immediately sent an email. That was the beginning.\u201d",
      "Some Legacy Runners said they were inspired by U.S. runner Joan Benoit, who won the first Olympic women\u2019s marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.",
      "May DuBois, 80, remembers watching the race on TV and seeing Benoit finish far ahead of the rest of the pack of runners. A classical pianist, she had never run in her life.",
      "Two years later, DuBois ran the same path as Benoit \u2014 starting and ending at the Memorial Coliseum \u2014 since back then, the LA Marathon route was the same as the Olympics. She said it felt just \u201clike running in the Olympics with everybody cheering us on.\u201d",
      "Now, she can\u2019t imagine going a day without running 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8 km).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I look good, and I don\u2019t get tired. I never get sick, I don\u2019t even catch colds,\u201d said DuBois, who hosts a brunch to celebrate after each marathon.",
      "Each year, Legacy Runners are given the same bib number. They start meeting monthly for training about six months before the marathon.",
      "Cliff Housego, 76, started running after his father died at 48 from a heart attack. He decided he wanted to live long enough to see his grandchildren and even great-grandchildren.",
      "Over the years, Housego has gone through two divorces and lost his daughter. Through it all, the marathon has been a constant in his life.",
      "\u201cMany, many things could\u2019ve stopped me from being there,\u201d Housego said.",
      "At 83, Sharon Kerson realizes that, too.",
      "After a year of dealing with sickness and vertigo, Kerson completed her training last week at the West Los Angeles College track, the same place she first started running more than 40 years ago. She has run more than 600 marathons.",
      "She wore a rain jacket from the St. George Marathon in Utah, shorts from the San Francisco Marathon and a T-shirt from the 30th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI never was fast and I\u2019m not competitive at all,\u201d Kerson said, adding that her only goal each time is to finish.",
      "Rick Bingham began racing in a wheelchair a decade ago after injuring his Achilles tendon during a triathlon. At 87, he swims half a mile (0.8 kilometer) every other day and lifts weights. To train, he went 5 miles (8 kilometers) one day around his ranch in a wheelchair.",
      "Bingham has no plans to slow down. He wants to reach his 50th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll only be 97 when I do that,\u201d he said.",
      "Bingham's commitment to remaining in the race has inspired Luis Gallardo to continue.",
      "Gallardo, 71, was planning to quit after his 38th marathon, when his knees gave out. But he began training again when Bingham offered him his extra racing wheelchair.",
      "\u201cWe went through too many things over the years, too many hardships,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cTo do it with him is just a blessing.\u201d",
      "Gallardo\u2019s goal is now to reach the 50th LA marathon with Bingham.",
      "After that, he said, he will find a way to finish the race with his friend, even carrying him across the finish line if he has to."

      "Every year, millions of people fill out their own brackets in hopes of correctly guessing who will win each round. It\u2019s a nationwide phenomenon that takes over offices, families and friend groups, with spectators and sports bettors competing to see who will have the most accurate bracket.",
      "A huge reason why March Madness is so popular is its unpredictability. Lower-seeded teams regularly beat the higher-seeded ones, throwing brackets and predictions completely out of the window.",
      "Thirty-one of the 68 teams automatically qualify to play in the NCAA Tournament because they won their respective conference tournaments. The remaining 37 teams are chosen by that 12-person committee mentioned earlier.",
      "Next, the committee will seed all of the teams. It determines seeding by wins, losses, strength of schedule and other metrics.",
      "The teams are seeded 1-16 within each of the four regions. The top-seeded team will play the bottom-seeded team, and so on.",
      "In 2011, when the tournament expanded from 64 to 68 teams, it also introduced the First Four round. That pits the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams against each other. The winners enter the traditional bracket.",
      "Well, you\u2019d be the first.",
      "The odds of doing so are pretty absurd. The closest anyone has ever gotten on the men's side was an Ohio man in 2019 who predicted the entire tournament into the Sweet 16.",
      "If you do happen to make a perfect bracket, there could be more in it for you than just bragging rights.",
      "Perfect bracket pickers have been offered as much as $1 billion. That's the figure Warren Buffett offered to his Berkshire Hathaway employees in 2014 if any of them picked it perfect.",
      "Every game of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments will be broadcast live. The men\u2019s will air on CBS, TBS, TNT or TruTV and their digital platforms, including Paramount+. CBS will handle the Final Four and national title game. The women\u2019s will air on ESPN\u2019s networks and streaming services with select games on ABC.",
      "Selection Sunday is on March 16, the Sunday before the First Four, beginning at 6 p.m. ET.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 25 years after Ichiro Suzuki embarked on a Hall of Fame career for the Seattle Mariners, the impact of Japanese players in Major League Baseball is at a high point",
      "TOKYO -- Ichiro Suzuki was having his typical day on a baseball field in 2000, putting on a power display during batting practice before ripping line drives all over the field for the Orix BlueWave during a preseason doubleheader.",
      "American infielder Torey Lovullo \u2014 who was in the other dugout playing the final year of his career in Japan with the Yakult Swallows \u2014 couldn't believe his eyes.",
      "The 26-year-old's combination of speed, power and skill was off the charts. How did he not know about this guy?",
      "\u201cI told my translator, get me three baseballs,\u201d the current Arizona Diamondbacks manager said. \u201cHe needs to sign them. That\u2019s the best hitter I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Lovullo was ahead of the curve in identifying a future Major League Baseball legend. Suzuki came to the United States the following year, signing with the Seattle Mariners, and embarked on a Hall of Fame career that included 3,089 MLB hits and a lasting legacy.",
      "Nearly 25 years after Suzuki's MLB debut, the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers will face the Chicago Cubs in two regular-season games in Tokyo, and Japanese players will be the centerpiece of the experience. Two-way Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is widely considered the best player in the world while teammates Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki are important parts of the pitching staff.",
      "Over on the Cubs, Seiya Suzuki is one of the best hitters in the lineup, while Shota Imanaga is the ace pitcher. He'll face Yamamoto on Tuesday in the first all-Japanese starting pitcher duel in MLB history.",
      "It's quite a moment for Japan, Japanese baseball and the dozens of players who slowly paved the road for today's generation to be such a big part of the American baseball scene.",
      "\u201cVery excited \u2014 my family's very excited,\u201d Seiya Suzuki said. \u201cI think it's a great opportunity to make memories over there.\u201d",
      "The first Japanese-born player in the big leagues was Masanori Murakami, who pitched for the San Francisco Giants during the 1964 and 1965 seasons.",
      "But it was thirty years later when pitcher Hideo Nomo came to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995 that Japan's presence in the big leagues really started to be felt. His unorthodox delivery \u2014 turning his back toward home plate during his windup \u2014 helped make him an immediate sensation and he won National League Rookie of the Year and made the All-Star team after finishing with a 13-6 record and 2.54 ERA.",
      "\u201cIt was on TV, so as a kid growing up, you'd see him pitch in the major leagues and that became a thing in Japan,\u201d said Atsuya Furuta, who was a star catcher in Japan from 1990-2007. \u201cBaseball kids wanted to play in the major leagues.\u201d",
      "At first, it was mostly pitchers who came from Japan to play in the U.S. Shigetoshi Hasegawa was a quality reliever for the Angels and Mariners starting in the late 1990s, and Kazuhiro Sasaki was an All-Star closer for the Mariners in the early 2000s.",
      "But Suzuki was the one who opened the door for Japanese hitters, signing with the Mariners in 2001.",
      "\u201cWhen Ichiro finally came over and began his rise in this game, it showed the way for other young Japanese players to see it was possible to come here,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cThere was always an insecurity that they weren\u2019t big enough or strong enough and couldn\u2019t compete at this level.",
      "\"But that\u2019s certainly never been the case in my opinion.\u201d",
      "After Suzuki's arrival, several Japanese hitters found success in the big leagues. Outfielder Hideki Matsui was an integral part of the New York Yankees from 2003-12, making two All-Star teams, hitting 175 homers and helping the franchise win the 2009 World Series.",
      "Outfielder So Taguchi helped the Cardinals win the World Series in 2006 and the Phillies earn the title in 2008. Kosuke Fukudome was an All-Star for the Chicago Cubs in 2008.",
      "That paved the way for the current generation that includes Ohtani, Seiya Suzuki and Boston's Masataka Yoshida, who has hit 25 homers over the past two seasons. Once a curiosity, players who come over from Japan are no longer a curiousity for American fans, instead becoming part of the game's landscape.",
      "It's no accident that the Dodgers are at the forefront of showcasing Japanese baseball excellence.",
      "The franchise has a long history of seeking out racially and ethnically diverse talent. Jackie Robinson \u2014 baseball's first Black player \u2014 debuted with the franchise in 1947 when they were located in Brooklyn. In 1981, Mexican pitcher Fernando Valenzuela turned into a sensation and ended up having a stellar 17-year career. Then in 1994, pitcher Chan Ho Park was the first Korean in the big leagues.",
      "Nomo's arrival in 1995 was an extension of the franchise's ethos. Grace McNamee \u2014 who worked for the Dodgers in the mid-1990s \u2014 was one of Nomo's translators during his first few seasons and said former owner Peter O'Malley was always a champion for the sport's worldwide growth.",
      "\u201cWith the O'Malley family, they were all about globalizing the game,\u201d McNamee said. \u201cIt was really important for Peter to make sure that everyone \u2014 including the Japanese media \u2014 was able to be accommodated.\u201d",
      "Current Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has been a good caretaker of that legacy. His father was Black, his mother Japanese and the former MLB outfielder was born in Okinawa, Japan, on a U.S. military base. That background didn't hurt when recruiting the likes of Ohtani, Yamamoto and Sasaki.",
      "The Dodgers manager visited Japan over the winter, dining with legendary slugger Sadaharu Oh, and takes pride in knowing the franchise is a destination for Japanese players.",
      "\u201cTheir experiences here playing in the states with the Dodgers has been truly a good one, and I think it\u2019s a responsibility for the Dodgers because I do think we\u2019re the epicenter globally for baseball,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "The current generation of Japanese baseball players in America might be the deepest ever.",
      "Even outside of the Dodgers and Cubs, there are plenty of other players making their mark. Yu Darvish is a five-time All-Star who is still an important part of the San Diego Padres pitching rotation, while Yoshida is a key cog of the Red Sox lineup.",
      "Veteran Kenta Maeda is trying to have a bounce back season with the Detroit Tigers and finished second in the AL Cy Young award voting in 2020 when he was with the Minnesota Twins. The New York Mets are hoping Kodai Senga can regain his 2023 form, when the right-hander was an All-Star at the top of the rotation.",
      "Lefty Yusei Kikuchi \u2014 a 2021 All-Star \u2014 signed a $63 million, three-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels during the offseason. Kikuchi actually made his MLB debut in Japan with the Seattle Mariners when they played against the Oakland Athletics in the first two games of the 2019 season. He said the trip was a great chance to build camaraderie with teammates as they traveled the country.",
      "That trip was defined by the last two games of Ichiro Suzuki's career \u2014 a retirement party celebrating a baseball legend. This week, Ohtani will be the centerpiece.",
      "\u201cIt's a chance to showcase some Japanese talent over there and I think all of Japan is pretty excited about that,\u201d Kikuchi said.",
      "Even in American baseball's lower levels, Japanese players are making their presence felt. Two young stars \u2014 19-year-old Rintaro Sasaki and 18-year-old Shotaro Morii \u2014 have made an early move to the U.S.",
      "Sasaki's a slugging first baseman who plays at Stanford while Morii is a potential two-way player who signed a $1.5 million minor-league deal in January with the Athletics.",
      "Lovullo \u2014 who was so in awe of Suzuki 25 years ago \u2014 can rightfully say he saw the revolution coming.",
      "\u201cI felt like it was just a matter of time before more started to emerge,\" Lovullo said. \"We want to have the greatest players in the world playing here in America and they come and represent themselves very well and make our game better.\u201d",

But JGR changed the throttle body on the No. 20 Toyota after qualifying, resulting in Bell forfeiting his starting spot.",

Emeka Eneli notched his first assist this season on the score. He collected the first three assists of his career last year.",
      "The Dynamo (0-3-1) pulled even when Ezequiel Ponce took a pass from Jack McGlynn and found the net in the 16th minute. It was Ponce's first goal this season after scoring five times in 10 appearances as a rookie last season. McGlynn's assist was his first in his first season with Houston. McGlynn had seven goals and 13 assists over four prior seasons with the Philadelphia Union.",
      "Luna's winner came in the fifth minute of stoppage time with some help from Dominik Marczuk.

      "The next time you get a call about an upcoming medical appointment you may not be talking to a human",
      "The next time you\u2019re due for a medical exam you may get a call from someone like Ana: a friendly voice that can help you prepare for your appointment and answer any pressing questions you might have.",
      "With her calm, warm demeanor, Ana has been trained to put patients at ease \u2014 like many nurses across the U.S. But unlike them, she is also available to chat 24-7, in multiple languages, from Hindi to Haitian Creole.",
      "That\u2019s because Ana isn\u2019t human, but an artificial intelligence program created by Hippocratic AI, one of a number of new companies offering ways to automate time-consuming tasks usually performed by nurses and medical assistants.",
      "It\u2019s the most visible sign of AI\u2019s inroads into health care, where hundreds of hospitals are using increasingly sophisticated computer programs to monitor patients' vital signs, flag emergency situations and trigger step-by-step action plans for care \u2014 jobs that were all previously handled by nurses and other health professionals.",
      "Hospitals say AI is helping their nurses work more efficiently while addressing burnout and understaffing. But nursing unions argue that this poorly understood technology is overriding nurses' expertise and degrading the quality of care patients receive.",
      "\u201cHospitals have been waiting for the moment when they have something that appears to have enough legitimacy to replace nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon of National Nurses United. \u201cThe entire ecosystem is designed to automate, de-skill and ultimately replace caregivers.\u201d",
      "Mahon\u2019s group, the largest nursing union in the U.S., has helped organize more than 20 demonstrations at hospitals across the country, pushing for the right to have say in how AI can be used \u2014 and protection from discipline if they decide to disregard automated advice. The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses \u201cas good as any doctor\u201d could help deliver care in rural areas. On Friday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who\u2019s been nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, said he believes AI can \u201cliberate doctors and nurses from all the paperwork.\u201d",
      "Hippocratic AI initially promoted a rate of $9 an hour for its AI assistants, compared with about $40 an hour for a registered nurse. It has since dropped that language, instead touting its services and seeking to assure customers that they have been carefully tested. The company did not grant requests for an interview.",
      "Hospitals have been experimenting for years with technology designed to improve care and streamline costs, including sensors, microphones and motion-sensing cameras. Now that data is being linked with electronic medical records and analyzed in an effort to predict medical problems and direct nurses' care \u2014 sometimes before they've evaluated the patient themselves.",
      "Adam Hart was working in the emergency room at Dignity Health in Henderson, Nevada, when the hospital's computer system flagged a newly arrived patient for sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Under the hospital's protocol, he was supposed to immediately administer a large dose of IV fluids. But after further examination, Hart determined that he was treating a dialysis patient, or someone with kidney failure. Such patients have to be carefully managed to avoid overloading their kidneys with fluid.",
      "Hart raised his concern with the supervising nurse but was told to just follow the standard protocol. Only after a nearby physician intervened did the patient instead begin to receive a slow infusion of IV fluids.",
      "\u201cYou need to keep your thinking cap on\u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re being paid as a nurse,\u201d Hart said. \u201cTurning over our thought processes to these devices is reckless and dangerous.\u201d",
      "Hart and other nurses say they understand the goal of AI: to make it easier for nurses to monitor multiple patients and quickly respond to problems. But the reality is often a barrage of false alarms, sometimes erroneously flagging basic bodily functions \u2014 such as a patient having a bowel movement \u2014 as an emergency.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to focus on your work but then you\u2019re getting all these distracting alerts that may or may not mean something,\u201d said Melissa Beebe, a cancer nurse at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even tell when it\u2019s accurate and when it\u2019s not because there are so many false alarms.\u201d",
      "Even the most sophisticated technology will miss will miss signs that nurses routinely pick up on, such as facial expressions and odors, notes Michelle Collins, dean of Loyola University\u2019s College of Nursing. But people aren't perfect either.",
      "\u201cIt would be foolish to turn our back on this completely,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe should embrace what it can do to augment our care, but we should also be careful it doesn\u2019t replace the human element.\u201d",
      "More than 100,000 nurses left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one estimate, the biggest staffing drop in 40 years. As the U.S. population ages and nurses retire, the U.S. government estimates there will be more than 190,000 new openings for nurses every year through 2032.",
      "Faced with this trend, hospital administrators see AI filling a vital role: not taking over care, but helping nurses and doctors gather information and communicate with patients.",
      "At the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences in Little Rock, staffers need to make hundreds of calls every week to prepare patients for surgery. Nurses confirm information about prescriptions, heart conditions and other issues \u2014 like sleep apnea \u2014 that must be carefully reviewed before anesthesia.",
      "The problem: many patients only answer their phones in the evening, usually between dinner and their children\u2019s bedtime.",
      "\u201cSo what we need to do is find a way to call several hundred people in a 120-minute window -- but I really don\u2019t want to pay my staff overtime to do so,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Sanford, who oversees the center\u2019s health IT.",
      "Since January, the hospital has used an AI assistant from Qventus to contact patients and health providers, send and receive medical records and summarize their contents for human staffers. Qventus says 115 hospitals are using its technology, which aims to boost hospital earnings through quicker surgical turnarounds, fewer cancellations and reduced burnout.",
      "Each call begins with the program identifying itself as an AI assistant.",
      "\u201cWe always want to be fully transparent with our patients that sometimes they are talking to a human and sometimes they\u2019re not,\u201d Sanford said.",
      "While companies like Qventus are providing an administrative service, other AI developers see a bigger role for their technology.",
      "Israeli startup Xoltar specializes in humanlike avatars that conduct video calls with patients. The company is working with the Mayo Clinic on an AI assistant that teaches patients cognitive techniques for managing chronic pain. The company is also developing an avatar to help smokers quit. In early testing, patients have spent about 14 minutes talking to the program, which can pickup on facial expressions, body language and other cues, according to Xoltar.",
      "Nursing experts who study AI say such programs may work for people who are relatively healthy and proactive about their care. But that\u2019s not most people in the health system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the very sick who are taking up the bulk of health care in the U.S. and whether or not chatbots are positioned for those folks is something we really have to consider,\u201d said Roschelle Fritz of the University of California Davis School of Nursing.",

      "Renault is testing a new driverless mini-bus in Barcelona this week. The autonomous vehicle is running on a 2.2-km (1.3-mile) circular route with four stops in the center of the Spanish city. Adventurous commuters can jump on free of charge.",
      "The French carmaker has teamed up with WeRide, a company specializing in autonomous vehicles, to make the prototype. It unveiled the driverless bus at the French Open venue last year, but now it is testing it on the open road in Barcelona. It also has testing projects going in Valence, France, and at the Zurich airport.",

And this is why we want to show that this works and prepare Europe to this route in public transportation.\u201d",
      "The electric bus can run for 120 kilometers without a recharge and reach 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph). It is equipped with 10 cameras and eight lidars (sensor arrays) to help it navigate the streets filled with cars, motorbikes and pedestrians. The company says the bus is able to drive safely on a given course through a busy downtown like that of bustling Barcelona.",
      "Carlos Santos, of Renault\u2019s autonomous driving group, said that he has seen all types of reactions from riders.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.",
      "In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA.",
      "To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security.",
      "Medusa developers and affiliates \u2014 called \u201cMedusa actors\u201d \u2014 use a double extortion model, where they \u201cencrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,\u201d the advisory said. Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information.",
      "\u201cRansom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cAt this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.\u201d",

Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage",
      "ROME -- The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to the hospital, the most serious suffering contusions after part of a ceiling collapsed, officials said.",
      "The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.",
      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.",
      "Inspectors were checking buildings for further damage, Manfredi said. \u201cWe are following with the greatest attention all of our structures, and are monitoring all events in real time,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said.",
      "In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said.",
      "Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.",
      "The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.",
      "At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.",
      "During the 1984 event, 40,000 residents were evacuated during a period of intense seismic activity as a precaution against a feared eruption that did not occur.",

      "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant\u2019s radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday",
      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",

      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",

      "It was unclear what caused her death, but colleagues say she had complained of fatigue and was \u201cdesperate to go back home.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war.",
      "T he fall for the S&P 500 is steep enough that Wall Street has a name for it: a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Such drops have happened regularly for more than a century, and market pros often view them as potentially healthy wipeouts of overdone euphoria, which could send stock prices too high if unchecked.",
      "But corrections are frightening in the moment, particularly for every new generation of investors that gets into the market at a time when it seems like stocks only go up.",
      "The S&P 500 is coming off two straight years with gains of more than 20%. Such stellar gains left the market looking too expensive to critics, who pointed to how prices rose faster than corporate profits.",
      "Culling too-high enthusiasm among day traders is one thing. The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming \"bear market,\" which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward.",
      "The U.S. stock market initially jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November on hopes he'd bring lower taxes, less regulation for businesses and other policies that would drive corporate profits higher. All those gains have since disappeared, as Wall Street faces the potential downsides of Trump's White House for the economy.",
      "The president has been making announcements on tariffs at a dizzying pace, first placing them on trading partners, then exempting some and then doing it all over again. The tariffs could hit every country that trades with the United States, which would raise prices for U.S. households and businesses when high inflation has already proven stubborn to fully subdue.",
      "The fear is that tariffs could slow or even halt the solid growth the U.S. economy was showing when it ended 2024. Even if Trump ultimately goes forward with less painful tariffs, all the uncertainty around the will-he-or-won't-he rollout could prove damaging by freezing economic activity. Such concerns have shown up in the latest readings on consumer confidence, as well as companies' forecasts for future profits.",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged his plans could affect the U.S. economy's growth.",
      "All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024.",
      "Most of the other big stocks in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year.",
      "Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks.",
      "The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon.",
      "The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came.",
      "Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12.",
      "Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses.",
      "For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example.",
      "A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak.",
      "The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse.",
      "No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain.",
      "The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns."

      "Shares have plummeted 45% in 2025 and on Monday tumbled more than 15% to $222.15, the lowest since late October, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.",
      "In an overnight post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Musk is \u201cputting it on the line\u201d to help the country. Trump claimed in the post that \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d were attempting to \u201cillegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's \u2018baby.\"",
      "The stock climbed more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday.",
      "Numerous auto industry analysts have attributed Tesla's recent sagging stock \u2014 and auto sales \u2014 to Musk's support of Trump and other far right candidates around the world. In recent days, Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized on the street. Tesla owners, perhaps in a bid to avoid being targeted, have placed bumper stickers on their cars with messages like, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d",
      "Federal prosecutors charged a woman in connection with a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership, which included Molotov cocktails being thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray painted on the building.",
      "Musk pumped $270 million into Trump's campaign heading into the 2024 election, appeared on stage with him and cheered Trump's victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November. Tesla stock soared to $479 per share by mid-December, but have since lost 45% of their value.",
      "Musk has become the face of the Trump administration's slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending.",
      "Analysts have said Musk's shift to right-wing politics doesn't appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy and progressive consumers.",
      "Tesla sales are falling precipitously in California, the company's biggest U.S. market, and the company recorded its first annual global sales decline last year. Similarly, Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France.",
      "The latest auto sales figure from China show that Tesla sales there have been nearly halved from February a year ago, although the decline is largely due increased competition from domestic EV companies.",
      "But sales in the U.S. have fallen due to competition, and a country sharply divided about Trump.",
      "U.S. Analysts at UBS Global Research expect deliveries to fall 5% in the first quarter and full year compared to the same periods for 2024.",
      "\u201cOur UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within two weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand,\u201d they wrote.",
      "In addition to backing Trump, Musk has also shown support for the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d and called Canada \u2014 a major Tesla market \u2014\"not a real country.\u201d",
      "Tesla is not the only Musk-led company to run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a \u201cmassive\" cyberattack. But like the clear-cutting he's done with federal jobs, Musk slashed the number of employees at X and technology experts warned of increased vulnerability.",
      "Last week, a rocket launched by Musk's SpaceX exploded and broke apart over Florida, about two months after another of the company's rockets failed."

      "\"Maybe we can. Maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance,\" he said, speaking onboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington, D.C., on Sunday night.",
      "The Trump administration has in recent weeks been pushing Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage on ending the 3-year-old war, high-stakes diplomatic maneuvering that included negotiating a potential 30-day ceasefire with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Kremlin has yet to agree, with Putin saying he was \"for it\" but also that he sought further security guarantees. Zelenskyy over the weekend accused Putin of \"prolonging\" the war.",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday reiterated that sentiment, saying in his nightly address that \"Russia stole almost another week -- a week of war that only Russia wants.\" He said Ukraine would do anything to further diplomacy that would end the war, but that \"defense and resilience are paramount\"",
      "\"We must remember -- as long as the occupier is on our land, and as long as air raid sirens sound, we must defend Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said, according to a translated transcript provided by his office.",
      "Zelenskyy has long held that a Ukrainian victory against the Russian invasion would include the country taking back the territory captured by Russia during the war. The Kremlin also annexed the Crimean Peninsula after Russia's 2014 invasion.",
      "Putin last week echoed Zelenskyy's words, saying he would seek a total victory in Kursk, the Russian border region captured by Ukraine in a surprise incursion late last summer, by regaining every inch of it.",
      "Asked what sort of concessions the U.S. would be seeking from Moscow and Kyiv to strike a ceasefire agreement, Trump indicated discussions around land and power plants were on the table, as well as \u201cdividing up\u201d assets between the two countries.",
      "\u201cWell, I think we'll be talking about land. It's a lot of land,\" he said on Sunday. \"It's a lot different than it was before the wars, you know. And we'll be talking about land, we'll be talking about power plants. That's a big question, but I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much by both sides.\"",

      "The Houthis then launched a successful counterstrike on Sunday.",
      "The United States airstrikes that bombarded Yemen over the weekend targeted and \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday.",
      "Speaking on ABC's \"This Week,\" Waltz argued to co-anchor Martha Raddatz that these latest strikes differed from the countless strikes former President Joe Biden's administration launched against the rebel group, explaining that President Donald Trump's administration has taken the extra step of designating the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth -- what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Waltz accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack U.S. warships and global commerce. Some 70% of global commerce is now diverting around South Africa to avoid the Houthis, resulting in higher shipping costs and supply chain issues, Waltz said.",
      "\"President Trump has found it unacceptable. What we inherited was -- was a terrible situation, and this is one of what will be a sustained effort to right that wrong and to reopen global commerce,\" Waltz said.",
      "A source told ABC News on March 15 that the strikes are not expected to be a single-day event. On social media, Trump warned the Houthis that if their attacks do not stop, \"HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\"",
      "Trump also issued a warning to Iran, calling on the Islamic Republic to stop supporting the Houthis, and adding: \"Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won\u2019t be nice about it!\"",
      "The Houthis retaliated against U.S. Navy ships on Sunday, but the drones and missile fired at them did not come close to striking the ships, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The official also said that it is safe to say that the Houthis fired the weapons for more than 12 hours.",
      "Saying that the group was committed to \"responding to escalation by escalation,\" the Yemeni Armed Forces released a statement on Monday, local time, saying that it had launched a second offensive, lasting several hours.",
      "It said that they had once again attacked the USS Harry S. Truman on Sunday \"with a number of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones in an engagement that lasted for several hours.\"",
      "According to their statement, the second advance was successful.",
      "\"The Yemeni Armed Forces succeeded in thwarting a hostile attack the enemy was preparing to launch against our country,\" the statement claimed.",
      "However, the fact of the second attack and the matter of its success are yet to be verified.",
      "Highlights from Waltz's interview",
      "\"Well, all actions are always on the table with the president. But Iran needs to hear him loud and clear. It is completely unacceptable and it will be stopped. The level of support that they\u2019ve been providing the Houthis, just like they have Hezbollah, just like they have the militias in Iraq, Hamas and others. The difference here is the Houthis have incredibly sophisticated air defenses, and they also have anti-shipping cruise missiles, drones, sea skimming types of attack drones and other ballistic missiles even. They\u2019ve launched dozens of attacks on multiple war ships, dozens of attacks, over 175 on global commerce, sank multiple ships. ... We will hold not only the Houthis accountable, but we\u2019re going to hold Iran, their backers, accountable as well. And if that means they\u2019re targeting ships that they have put in to -- to help their Iranian trainers, IRGC and others, that intelligence, other things that they have put in to help the Houthis attack the global economy, those -- those targets will be on the table, too.\"",
      "\"What the president has completely -- has repeatedly said is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one. And that\u2019s all aspects of Iran's program. That\u2019s the missiles, the weaponization, the enrichment. They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences. But, either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button. We cannot have a situation that would result in an arms race across the Middle East in terms of nuclear proliferation. ... Iran has been offered a way out of this to make sure that we don\u2019t have a world that can be threatened by a radical regime, not only our ally Israel, but the entire world that would be threated with a \u2013 with \u2013 by a radical regime that could destroy, not only Israel, but its neighbors, and have the capability to hit the United States.\"",
      "\"A fundamental aspect of the approach here from President Trump is that, you know, this has to be permanent. That\u2019s what we continue to hear from the Ukrainians, that, you know, we cannot have a situation where this continues to break down. At the same time, we are engaging with the Russians. What we heard from President Putin was that he will absolutely consider a ceasefire. There are some other thing that he would like to see that President Trump\u2019s national security team has -- is considering over the coming days. So, this back and forth diplomacy is -- is ongoing.\"",
      "\"We have to ask ourselves, is it in our national interest? Is it realistic? We\u2019ve talked to the Europeans about this, and the Ukrainians. Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea? And what the strategy of the Biden administration was, was, as long as it takes, as much as it takes, no matter what the timeline is, which is essentially endless warfare, in an environment that we are literally losing hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months. And could escalate into World War III. ... We can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that\u2019s what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks.\"",

      "ABC News examined some of President Donald Trump's common complaints about the Department of Education and the state of education in the United States.",
      "Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. ranks last in the world in education among developed countries while spending the most per pupil.",
      "\"So they rank the top 40 countries in the world, we are ranked No. 40th, but we are ranked No. 1 in one department: cost per pupil,\" Trump said at the White House last month. \"So we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, but we're ranked No. 40.\"",
      "This claim is not true based on data reviewed by ABC News. The U.S. is not ranked last in education nor does it spend the most per pupil.",
      "The White House didn't respond to ABC News' request for information about Trump's claim. It's unclear which data Trump used to base his claims.",
      "Even though the country spends a lot per pupil, the Education Data Initiative found an average of $20,387 per year of federal, state and local spending. The amount is the third-highest per pupil (after adjusting to local currency values). The country is not last in any education statistic that ABC News has reviewed.",
      "The U.S. is above average in reading and science, and about average when it comes to scores in math, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA is the industry standard for ranking students from different countries, according to education experts. There are roughly 40 member countries and economies in the OECD and about 40 more countries have participated in the last three assessments. It varies by year -- in 2015, 70 countries and economies participated; in 2018, 78 participated.",
      "In 2022, the most recently released data, roughly 81 countries took part in OECD's PISA assessments, which measure 15-year-olds' ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 81 in reading, 16th/81 in science, and 34th/81 in math, according to the 2022 PISA results.",

      "However, this is not to say American students are always high achievers. Some results on nationally administered exams have shown concerns as of late.",
      "America's fourth- and eighth-grade students' sliding reading scores worsened in 2024, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, dubbed the nation's report card, which is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics under the Department of Education. Compared to 2022, this year's average reading scores dropped by 2 points for both fourth- and eighth-grade assessments, according to the NCES data conducted between January and March 2024. That adds to the 3-point decrease for both grades in 2022.",
      "Despite the decline in reading, there was some recovery in math in 2024, but the increase has not returned students to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "And NCES also found nearly one third of U.S. students ended the 2023-2024 school year behind grade level in at least one academic subject.",
      "It is unclear whether this data will be collected in future years if the DOE is eliminated.",
      "The Trump administration has stated that through cuts at the Department of Education, they want to return education to the states.",
      "\"The president wants to return education back to the states, empower those closest to the people to make these very important decisions for our children's lives. And ... this is a first step in that process,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said to ABC News' Selina Wang when asked about the cuts at the DOE.",
      "Education is a local level-issue already as the federal education department only administers roughly 10% of public school funds nationwide, according to multiple education experts.",
      "The Department of Education does not administer curriculum or create lessons for the nation's students. It also does not set requirements for enrollment and graduation or establish or accredit schools or universities.",
      "In fact, curriculum comes from the states and local school districts. The education department doesn't teach the students taking standardized exams and assessments. The states already do that.",
      "The education department does hold schools accountable for enforcing non-discrimination laws based on race, gender and disability.",
      "The agency also administers funds for K-12 education support programs such as the Rural Education Achievement Program, which supports rural districts that may lack personnel and resources; Title I, which funds programs aimed at improving the performance of low-income and low-achieving schools; and grants for Individuals with Disabilities including the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for students.",
      "Not only does the department administer K-12 assistance, it also helps students pursue higher education through the office of Federal Student Aid through grants, work-study funds and low-interest loans.",
      "Finally, the DOE holds schools accountable for student achievement through the Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires each state to provide data on subject performance, graduation rates, suspensions, absenteeism, teacher qualifications and more.",

      "\"They are horrible people. They are scum,\" Trump said of those who oppose him in court. \"We will have these cases where you cannot allow yourselves to be deflected. You just cannot let it happen. You have such a higher calling.\"",
      "Trump's visit to DOJ headquarters, during which he laid out his vision for the department and repeatedly suggested his appointees should jail his political enemies, was a departure from decades of post-Watergate norms where DOJ leadership has sought to maintain an appearance of independence from the White House on criminal matters.",

      "He said his predecessors had turned it into the \"Department of Injustice.\"",
      "President Donald Trump visited the Justice Department on Friday -- a move that comes as he has sought to assert control over the nation's top law enforcement agency that brought two historic prosecutions against him, which were thwarted by his 2024 election victory.",
      "\"As we begin a proud new chapter in the chronicles of America, justice is really is something we're turning the page on for a long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals,\" Trump said to the crowd. \"And we are restoring fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution or rule of law. And you're the people that are doing it.",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, the DOJ and the FBI will once again become the premier crime fighting agencies on the face of the earth,\" he added.",
      "He used the setting to repeat his now-familiar accusation that the Justice Department was \"weaponized\" to attack him.",
      "\"We must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls. Unfortunately, in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated that trust and goodwill built up over generations,\" he said. \"They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.\"",
      "\"Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,\" continued Trump, who became a convicted felon in May 2024 after he was found guilty on 34 felony counts in New York. \"But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back. So now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\"",
      "The rare visit marks Trump's first time inside the walls of the Robert F. Kennedy building as president, and as such his first since crowds of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and were subsequently charged by the DOJ, and follows nearly a decade's worth of conflict that have proven to be the ultimate stress test for the Justice Department's post-Watergate norms intended to preserve independence from the White House.",
      "Trump himself faced four criminal court cases, but all remaining charges were dropped when he was elected president -- but not because the cases lacked merits -- allowing him to avoid serious consequences. The president denied all the allegations and said the cases were politically motivated.",
      "The opening weeks of Trump's presidency have been a time of unprecedented upheaval for the DOJ, as Trump's political leadership immediately moved to reassign or oust career officials who served in senior criminal and national security roles across multiple administrations.",
      "Dozens of prosecutors who worked on investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol were fired, as well as DOJ and FBI officials who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump.",
      "An effort by the department to drop its criminal corruption case against New York City Mayor Adams resulted in a dramatic standoff leading to multiple resignations by prosecutors and other top officials who described the arrangement as a clear \"quid pro quo\" to secure Adams' cooperation with the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "However, in the very same speech in which the president griped about his own prosecutions, he suggested that his predecessor should be jailed for the way his administration handled the Afghanistan withdrawal.",
      "\"What a shame. The way we got out, I think it was the most humiliating time in the history of our country,\" he said. \"The way it happened. Not that we were getting out because we wanted to get out, but we would have gotten out with dignity and strength. And what a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail, they should go to jail. So, I just want to say, God bless America because we have to say God bless. We're lucky we're still here.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed Trump's remarks on Fox News, saying that it will be focused on \"restoring law and order,\" but she added that he might also discuss \"ending the weaponization of justice.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump will go to the Department of Justice to visit with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to give a speech not just to the Department of Justice but to the American people about Donald Trump's intention to restore a justice department that is truly focused on fighting crime and restoring law and order in American communities,\" Leavitt said on Fox News.",
      "She also previewed the remarks when asked by reporters at the White House on Friday morning, saying that Trump will be joined by families who have lost children \"at the hands of illegal migrant criminals\" and because of \"illegal Chinese fentanyl.\"",
      "In remarks Thursday to reporters at the White House, Trump said his speech a thet DOJ would \"set out\" his \"vision\" for the department through the rest of his tenure.",
      "\"I think we have unbelievable people, and all I'm going to do is set out my vision. It's going to be their vision, really, but it's my ideas,\" he said. \"We want to have justice, and we want to have -- we want to have safety in our cities as well as our communities. And we'll be talking about immigration. We'll be talking about a lot of things.\"",
      "Nearly every top appointee for the department previously represented Trump as a defense attorney in either an official or personal capacity, a reflection of Trump's expectation for loyalty from a department that he has said he believes stymied his first term and was later \"weaponized\" against him after leaving office.",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi told senators in her confirmation hearing she would \"not politicize\" her office, her opening weeks, critics argue, have been marked with politically charged statements repeatedly emphasizing her loyalty to Trump.",
      "\"I've never seen this before, and we all adore Donald Trump and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda,\" Bondi said in an interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump.",
      "In another interview early this month, Bondi said she was still working to \"root out\" officials at the department who she said \"despise Donald Trump.\"",
      "In one of her first directives following her confirmation, Bondi ordered DOJ officials to \"zealously defend\" the interests of the presidency and threatened discipline or termination for any attorney who refused to sign onto legal arguments put forward by political leadership.",
      "\"When Department of Justice attorneys, for example, refuse to advance good-faith arguments by declining to appear in court or sign briefs, it undermines the constitutional order and deprives the President of the benefit of his lawyers,\" the directive stated.",
      "Trump's visit to DOJ is his first to any government agency since taking office, though it's not without precedent. The last visit by a sitting American president to the building was when former President Barack Obama attended a departure ceremony in 2015 for Eric Holder -- for a retirement ceremony honoring his time as attorney general.",

      "\"He was surrounded by many DHS agents, or people he believed to be DHS agents, and he believes that he saw or heard, during a call, one of them say that the White House wants an update on what's going on,\" Samah Sisay, a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights who is representing Khalil, said at a press conference Friday.",
      "\"We have every reason to believe, as we allege in the petition, that many people within the executive branch of the government were involved, including the White House,\" Sisay said.",
      "Khalil took part in student protests at Columbia University calling for the institution to divest and cut ties with Israel, and he participated in negotiations with university administration.",
      "\"His one and only goal was to get Columbia University to divest from its complicity with Israeli government crimes in Gaza and the West Bank,\" said Ramzi Kassem, the director of CLEAR, a group representing Khalil.",
      "The White House and Columbia University did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Columbia University said in a statement Thursday, \"We will continue to work to support our community, including protecting the privacy of our students, during this challenging time and we remain steadfastly committed to our values and our mission.\"",

      "\"I have those fliers on my desk, they were provided to me by the Department of Homeland Security,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "\"All of this talk of flyers is just nonsense, there is no truth to it whatsoever,\" Kassem said.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said their briefing on the motion to compel the government to return Khalil to New York should be finished by early next week. His attorneys hope the judge will make a decision sometime next week.",
      "\"Mahmoud was moved across multiple state lines and subsequently transferred to a remote prison in Louisiana hours after filing his habeas petition, an intentional and retaliatory act and an attempt to interfere with the jurisdiction of the New York court,\" Sisay said.",
      "In the weeks leading up to his arrest, Khalil said he had been fearing for his safety as he and other Columbia University students advocating for the rights of Palestinians experienced increased doxing and harassment, his attorneys said.",
      "\"It's like an almost daily occurrence where Twitter, social media posts showing photographs of students, identifying where they're located, where they live, who they're associated with, while tagging ICE, while tagging DHS, while tagging the president, tagging the Secretary of State,\" Amy Greer, an attorney with Dratel & Lewis who is representing Khalil, said Friday.",
      "\"He's genuinely fearful that what's happened to him will happen to others,\" Greer said.",
      "Khalil's attorneys accused the Trump administration of retaliating against Khalil for his protests and activism in support of Palestinians arguing his speech is protected by the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration is taking an extraordinarily broad and unconstitutional view of how the material support for terrorism laws apply in these contexts,\" Brian Hauss, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, said at the press conference.",
      "\"The Supreme Court was very clear in a case called Holder vs Humanitarian Law Project that the federal material supported terrorism laws do not apply to independent advocacy, even when that advocacy is explicitly supportive of a foreign designated terrorist organization, say a statement saying, 'I support Hamas,' if that statement is not coordinated with a foreign designated terrorist organization it is protected by the First Amendment,\" Hauss said.",
      "The First Amendment also protects the freedom of speech of individuals who are not American citizens, Hauss said. Khalil is a permanent resident of the U.S.",
      "\"Trump administration is punishing Mr. Khalil for his speech about Palestine. It is silencing him, and it is setting him up as an example to chill the millions of green card holders and other non-citizens around the country from saying anything that might draw President Trump's ire. That is textbook First Amendment retaliation,\" Hauss said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on X that the department \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil was detained by ICE \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\"",

      "The former TV host came under fire over potential cuts to the programs.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, faced a confirmation hearing Friday before the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Oz, a doctor and former television host whose nomination to lead CMS has put him in the political spotlight for the first time since his unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat three years ago, faced tough questions from Democrats on the 27-member committee, which will vote whether to move his nomination to a floor vote in front of the entire Senate.",
      "Oz talked about his accomplishments as a physician and TV host during his opening statement, noting the 10 Emmys his show won, and contended Trump \"wants to love and cherish Medicare and Medicaid.\"",
      "\"We have a generational opportunity to fix our health care system and help people stay healthy for longer,\" he said Friday.",
      "Oz said his main goals as the head of CMS deal with more transparency and eliminating waste, echoing Trump's goals.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the committee, however, slammed Oz during his introduction, calling him out over his past comments and actions. Wyden, D-Ore., noted Oz has had a history of promoting Medicare Advantage companies and baseless wellness remedies and claimed if confirmed the nominee would \"coddle the for profit insurance companies.\"",
      "\"Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays,\" he said.",
      "Oz did not commit to preventing cuts to Medicaid or Medicare.",
      "Wyden grew frustrated when Oz failed to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" when he asked whether Oz would oppose any cuts to the program.",
      "\"I cherish Medicaid,\" Oz responded, saying he's \"worked within the Medicaid environment quite extensively.\"",
      "Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., later asked, \"How many children losing health insurance would be acceptable to you?\"",
      "\"I don't want children to lose health insurance,\" Oz said.",
      "\"Well, then, you're going to need to reject the Republican budget,\" Hassan responded.",
      "Hassan challenged Oz, in particular, on his past promotion of green coffee extract as a possible weight-loss supplement.",
      "\"You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they've found the magic weight-loss cure for every body type \u2014 it's green coffee extract,\" Oz said on a 2012 episode of his show.",
      "A study Oz cited at the time was later retracted, and an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found the data behind the product was \"deeply flawed.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in particular, has been increasingly vocal ahead of the hearing about Oz's financial ties to health care companies that he will now oversee in his role at CMS and his past comments about privatizing Medicare, one of the programs he'll manage.",
      "She also criticized what she calls his \"hostile record\" on abortion rights, referring to Oz's comments on the campaign trail that a woman's decision to get an abortion should be made by her, her doctor and \"local political leaders.\"",
      "\"The implication that elected officials should be involved in a woman's personal health treatment decision is terrifying and antithetical to patient health,\" Warren wrote to Oz on Thursday.",
      "Republicans came to Oz's defense and also pushed their agenda for the agency, specifically in upholding the Hyde Amendment.",
      "The amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, only allowing exceptions to pay for the procedure when the life of the mother is at risk or the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Medicaid, for example, does not cover abortion services beyond those exceptions \u2014 though some states use their own funds to do so.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, argued that Biden took action to expand abortion access in ways that were \"explicitly in violation of the Hyde Amendment.\"",
      "\"If you're confirmed, will you commit to upholding the Hyde Amendment and ensuring that our federal health care programs are not providing abortions on the taxpayers' dime?\" he asked Oz.",
      "The nominee said he would.",
      "\"The implication that elected officials should be involved in a woman's personal health treatment decision is terrifying and antithetical to patient health,\" Warren wrote to Oz on Thursday.",
      "Oz also came under fire over his tax returns after Democrats said that he underpaid on Social Security and Medicare taxes by using a limited liability loophole.",
      "\"Dr. Oz's position is counter to the position of the Department of Treasury and results in him not paying into Social Security and Medicare, the very healthcare program he hopes to manage,\" Democratic Senate Finance Committee staff wrote in the memo, circulated to the committee.",
      "\"He avoided hundreds of thousands of dollars in Social Security and Medicare taxes in the years reviewed,\" the staff wrote. They reviewed Oz's taxes from 2021 to 2023.",
      "The committee staff reviewed Oz's tax returns and met with the nominee, his accountant and his lawyers earlier in March. Oz and his team maintained that he was not liable for the taxes the Democrats said he owed, according to the memo.",
      "Oz in the past has expressed support for Medicare Advantage, a Medicare-approved plan run by private insurance companies. The plan must follow rules set by Medicare, such as limiting out-of-pocket expenses and covering all services covered by traditional Medicare.",
      "\"Medicare Advantage has definitely become a much more important part of the Medicare program. It's now the most popular coverage option within the program,\" Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at the right-leaning think tank Paragon Health Institute, told ABC News.",

      "In an op-ed co-written for Forbes in June 2020, Oz said Medicare Advantage offers better care due to there being competing plans. He said Medicare Advantage could also be expanded to all Americans who are not on Medicaid, which would be funded by a 20% payroll tax.

      "The high-stakes race for Wisconsin Supreme Court has gotten most of the attention leading up to the April 1 election",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The high-stakes race for Wisconsin Supreme Court has gotten most of the attention leading up to the April 1 election. But it is not the only issue voters will decide when early voting begins Tuesday.",
      "Also on the ballot is a race for the battleground state's top education official who will guide policies affecting K-12 schools during President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "There is also a measure that would place the state's voter ID law into the state constitution.",
      "Both of those contests have sharp partisan divisions, even though the spending and national attention have been far less than those for the race for control of the state's highest court.",
      "Here is a closer look at what's at stake as voting begins Tuesday:",
      "The race to lead the state education department pits the teachers' union-backed incumbent, Jill Underly, against consultant Brittany Kinser, a supporter of the private school voucher program who is endorsed by Republicans.",
      "A third candidate lost the February primary, unable to chip away enough at Underly's key support. The day after her victory, the state teachers' union, which did not endorse in the primary, came out in support of Underly.",
      "Underly's education career began in 1999 as a high school social studies teacher in Indiana. She moved to Wisconsin in 2005 and worked five years for the state education department. She also worked as principal of Pecatonica Elementary School for a year before becoming the district administrator.",
      "Underly was elected as state superintendent in 2021 and is endorsed by the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which is the state teachers union, as well as the Wisconsin Democratic Party and numerous Democratic officeholders.",
      "Kinser, who is backed by the Wisconsin Republican Party, touts her past as a public school principal in her first television ad. But she doesn't mention it was a charter school. She worked for Rocketship schools, part of a national network of public charter schools and became its executive director in the Milwaukee region.",
      "In 2022, she left Rocketship to work for City Forward Collective, a Milwaukee education nonprofit that advocates for charter and voucher schools. She also founded a consulting firm that year where she currently works.",
      "Wisconsin is the only state where voters elect the top education official, but there is no state board of education. That gives the person who runs the Department of Public Instruction broad authority to oversee education policy, which includes dispersing money to schools and managing teacher licensing.",
      "Kinser has tried to brand Underly as being a poor manager of the Department of Public Instruction. She has keyed in on Underly's overhaul of state achievement standards last year.",
      "Underly said they better reflect what students are learning now, but bipartisan opposition included Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who served as state superintendent before being elected governor in 2018. Evers has not endorsed in the race.",
      "Kinser said the new standards lowered the bar for students and made it more difficult to see how schools and districts are performing over time.",
      "Underly tries to portray Kinser as nothing more than a lobbyist who doesn't care about public education. Kinser supports the state's private school voucher and charter school program, which Democrats and Underly are critical of. Opponents say those programs siphon money away from public schools.",
      "\u201cInstead of fighting for students, Kinser is standing with the far-right politicians who are trying to rip resources away from our schools,\" Underly said.",
      "Underly, who casts herself as the champion of public schools, also has tried to make the possible elimination of the U.S. Department of Education an issue in the race.",
      "Underly opposes dismantling the federal agency, while Kinser has said as long as the state continues to receive federal education funding, \u201cI am confident in our ability to navigate whatever changes Washington sends our way.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID requirement for voting would be elevated from a state law to a constitutional amendment under a proposal on the ballot.",
      "Even if voters reject it, the voter ID requirement that has been in state law since 2011 will remain in place. The law didn't go into effect permanently until 2016, after a series of unsuccessful lawsuits.",
      "Republicans put the measure on the ballot, pitching it as a way to bolster election security and protect the law from being overturned in court.",
      "But Democratic opponents argue photo ID requirements are often enforced unfairly, making it more difficult for people of color, the disabled and poor people to vote.",
      "If voters agree to place the photo ID requirement in the constitution, it would make it more difficult for a future Legislature controlled by Democrats to change a law they have long opposed. Any constitutional amendment must be approved in two consecutive legislative sessions and by a statewide vote of the people.",
      "Wisconsin is one of nine states where voters must present a photo ID to cast a ballot and its requirement is the strictest in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-six states have laws requiring or requesting that voters show some sort of identification at the polls, according to the conference."

      "For parents of kids with disabilities, advocating for their child can be complicated, time-consuming \u2014 and expensive",
      "WASHINGTON -- For parents of kids with disabilities, advocating for their child can be complicated, time-consuming \u2014 and expensive.",
      "Changes at the Education Department are likely to make the process even more difficult, advocates for kids with disabilities say.",
      "When a parent believes their child is not receiving proper services or school accommodations for a disability, they can seek remedies from their district. They can file complaints with their state, arguing the child's rights have been taken away without due process of law, or even pursue litigation in state or federal courts.",
      "Those processes often involve multiple sessions with hearing officers who are not required to be experts in disability law. Legal fees can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a single case. Legal aid and other advocacy organizations that can provide free assistance often have more demand for their services than they can meet.",
      "But filing a complaint with the Education Department has long been an option for families who can't afford a lawyer. They begin by filling out the Office for Civil Rights' online form, documenting the alleged instances of discrimination. From there, the agency's staff is supposed to investigate the complaint, often interviewing school district employees and examining district policies for broader possible violations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known and has the weight of the federal government behind it,\u201d said Dan Stewart, managing attorney for education and employment at the National Disability Rights Network. \u201cThe process, the complaint portal, as well as the processing manual are all in public, and it does not require or typically involve lawyers.\u201d",
      "That option seems increasingly out of reach, advocates say.",
      "Under President Donald Trump, the Education Department\u2019s staff has been cut approximately in half \u2014 including in the Office for Civil Rights, whose attorneys are charged with investigating complaints of discrimination against kids with disabilities. The staff has been directed to prioritize antisemitism cases. More than 20,000 pending cases \u2014 including those related to kids with disabilities, historically the largest share of the office\u2019s work \u2014 largely sat idle for weeks after Trump took office. A freeze on processing the cases was lifted early this month, but advocates question whether the department can make progress on them with a smaller staff.",
      "\u201cThe reduction in force is simply an evisceration of the Office for Civil Rights\u2019 investigatory authority and responsibility,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that I can see that OCR can keep up with the backlog or with the incoming complaints.\u201d",
      "A federal lawsuit filed Friday challenges the layoffs at the Office for Civil Rights, saying they decimated the office's ability to process and investigate complaints.",
      "While the OCR process was not perfect, reducing the office\u2019s investigative staff will only worsen the challenges families face when seeking support for their kids, said Nikki Carter, an advocate for kids with disabilities and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cIt makes them feel hopeless and helpless,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBy reducing the number of employees to handle cases, by putting stipulations on certain cases, it only makes it feel intensified.\u201d",
      "Education Department officials insist the staff reductions will not affect civil rights investigations and the layoffs were \u201cstrategic decisions.\u201d",
      "In her state of Alabama, Carter said families face an uphill battle to finding legal representation.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have the money for an attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cOr the representation they\u2019re getting is not the representation they feel like will be best for their child.\u201d",
      "Even if families can afford the high costs, a limited number of attorneys have the expertise to take on disability discrimination cases. Programs that offer free representation often have limited capacity.",
      "If the backlog of cases increases at the federal Office for Civil Rights, families may lose faith in how quickly the department will investigate their complaints, Stewart said. That may drive them to alternate pathways, such as filing state complaints.",
      "But state and local agencies haven't always had the capacity or understanding to handle education disability complaints, Stewart said, since those cases so often went to the U.S. Education Department.",
      "\u201cThey might not have the infrastructure or the knowledge or the staffing to take on the influx of cases,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "In a separate federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Democratic attorneys general argued the staff reductions at the Education Department may embolden school districts to ignore complaints of discrimination or harassment.",
      "\u201cStudents with current complaints will likely see no meaningful resolution, with cases backlogged due to the shortage of employees to resolve them,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cStudents facing discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual assault will lose a critical avenue to report their case.\u201d",

      "Robert Preston Morris, 63, is expected to surrender to officials in Osage County, where he was charged last week with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child, his attorney, Mack Martin, told The Associated Press.",
      "Martin declined to comment on the charges against Morris, but said he anticipated entering a not guilty plea on Morris' behalf.",
      "Court records show an Osage County judge set a $50,000 bond and ordered Morris to surrender his passport to the local sheriff.",
      "Morris resigned last year as pastor of Gateway Church in the Dallas suburb of Southlake after a woman accused him of sexually abusing her in the 1980s.",
      "The alleged abuse started in 1982 when the victim, referred to in the indictment as C.C., was 12 years old and Morris was a traveling evangelist staying in Hominy, Oklahoma, with her family, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. The abuse allegedly continued for four years.",
      "Cindy Clemishire, Morris\u2019 accuser, said in a statement that she is very grateful to the authorities who have worked to make the indictment possible and is hopeful \u201cjustice will ultimately prevail.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter almost 43 years, the law has finally caught up with Robert Morris for the horrific crimes he committed against me as a child,\u201d said Clemishire, now 55. \u201cNow, it is time for the legal system to hold him accountable.\u201d",
      "The AP typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Clemishire said she would like her name included.",
      "Morris was known to be politically active. The church hosted President Donald Trump on its Dallas campus in 2020 for a discussion on race relations and the economy.",
      "Morris could face up to 20 years in prison for each of the five charges, according to the attorney general\u2019s office."

      "President Donald Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang",
      "President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang. Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under Trump's order.",
      "The act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows non-citizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "Trump repeatedly hinted during his campaign that he would declare extraordinary powers to confront illegal immigration and laid additional groundwork in a slew of executive orders on Jan. 20.",
      "His proclamation on Saturday identified Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, blocked anyone from being deported under Trump's proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.",
      "In 1798, with the U.S. preparing for what it believed would be a war with France, Congress passed a series of laws that increased the federal government's reach. Worried that immigrants could sympathize with the French, the Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war.",
      "Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "During World War II, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment in the U.S. of people of German, Italian and especially Japanese ancestry. An estimated 120,000 people with Japanese heritage, including those with U.S. citizenship, were incarcerated during the war.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward preemptively sued Trump late Friday in federal court in Washington, D.C., saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention center in Raymondville, Texas, were at \u201cimminent risk of removal\u201d under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate appeal from the Justice Department.",
      "Almost simultaneously, the Trump administration agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison about 300 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang for one year.",
      "The agreement with El Salvador followed discussions between that country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about housing migrants in El Salvador\u2019s notorious prisons. Bukele\u2019s government has arrested more than 84,000 people, sometimes without due process, since 2022 in a crackdown on gang violence.",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said two flights Saturday may have carried people deported under Trump's proclamation, one to El Salvador and one possibly to Honduras. Boasberg said any such flights would have to be returned midair to the United States.",
      "For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people arriving illegally. Arrests on the U.S. border with Mexico topped 2 million a year for two straight years for the first time under President Joe Biden, with many released into the U.S. to pursue asylum. After hitting an all-time monthly high of 250,000 in December 2023, they plunged to less than 8,400 this February \u2014 the lowest levels since the 1960s.",
      "The act, Trump said in his inaugural address, would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cBy invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil,\u201d he said. \u201cAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.\u201d",
      "Critics say Trump is wrongly using the act to target non-state actors, not foreign governments.",
      "\u201cInvoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse,\u201d the Brennan Center for Justice wrote, calling it \u201cat odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice.\u201d",
      "\u201cSummary detentions and deportations under the law conflict with contemporary understandings of equal protection and due process,\u201d the Brennan Center said.",
      "It's a new and untested argument. Trump has warned of the power of Latin American criminal gangs in the U.S., but only a tiny percentage of the people living illegally in the U.S. are criminals.",
      "Trump, in his wartime declaration on Saturday, said Tren de Aragua \u201cis perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\u201d He said the gang was engaged in \u201cirregular warfare\u201d against the United States at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation\u2019s economy came undone last decade.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organizations as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations,\u201d upping pressure on cartels  operating in the U.S. and on anyone aiding them.",
      "Congress\u2019 research arm said in a report last month officials may use the foreign terrorist designations to argue the gang's activities in the U.S. amount to a limited invasion. \u201cThis theory appears to be unprecedented and has not been subject to judicial review,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said.",
      "The Venezuelan government has not typically taken its people back from the U.S., except on a few occasions. Over the past few weeks, about 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",

Fire Chief Terry Essary said at a news conference Saturday that the fires spread rapidly and crews had difficulty containing each one because of the high winds and low humidity. He said they quickly became overwhelmed.",

      "Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day has long been known for a boozy good time",
      "BOSTON -- Tommy McCarthy\u2019s Irish bar just outside Boston\u2019s city limits pours more Guinness than almost anywhere in the U.S., yet come this St. Patrick's Day, the longtime owner of The Burren is stocking up on plenty of nonalcoholic options too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way since we first opened,\u201d McCarthy said, who started slinging pints at the beloved establishment in 1996 after moving to the Boston area from West Clare, Ireland.",
      "There is perhaps no other holiday tied more to a city than St. Patrick's Day in Boston. According to historians, the city was the first in the country to throw a celebration for the patron saint of Ireland on March 17, 1737, as a way to support the city's wave of Irish immigrants.",
      "Yet while the holiday has become connected to heavy drinking over the centuries, a small but growing crowd has found ways to participate in the St. Patrick's Day parades, festivals and banquets without a buzz. They're doing so by turning to nonalcoholic beers, mocktails and solely sober spaces \u2014 even in the heart of Boston.",
      "\u201cSt. Patrick\u2019s Day is a huge drinking holiday. It is promoted absolutely everywhere,\u201d said Jackie Taylor who has been sober for 12 years.",
      "But she's found lots of ways to celebrate the holiday \u2014 whether out on the town or at home \u2014 without risking a situation where \"you might not make it out of there sober.\u201d",
      "Nonalcoholic drinks are popular on St. Patrick\u2019s Day weekend during The Burren's four days of Irish music shows, which can last 10 hours each. McCarthy said he\u2019s a Guinness drinker but sticks to the nonalcoholic brew when playing the fiddle.",
      "\u201cI top it up with the real creamy alcohol head,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re only getting a small bit of the alcohol, but you get the real cream. But you\u2019re also getting the taste of the real Guinness without the alcohol. It kind of beats all.\u201d",
      "Michelle Flynn, manager at the Brendan Behan Irish pub in Boston's Jamacia Plain, said most bars now serve nonalcoholic beers \u2014 a significant shift from decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe neighborhood, society, everything has changed, has shifted a 1,000% \u2014 especially in the youth,\u201d she said.",
      "It's not just bar owners noticing an uptick in a demand for nonalcoholic options. Young adults are drinking less than they were in decades past, according to polling by Gallup, which reported in 2023 that adults under 35 were less likely to say they use alcohol at least occasionally than they were in the early 2000s.",
      "Gallup also saw a decline in the share of young adults who drink regularly or say they sometimes drink \u201cmore than they think they should\u201d over the same time period.",
      "Michael Scelfo, chef and owner of four Boston area cocktail bars, said his businesses have served mocktails since he opened Cambridge-based Alden & Harlow 11 years ago. But after the pandemic, demand significantly increased.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of an expected and formidable part of the menu now,\u201d he said, with bartenders putting just as much care into a mocktail's execution.",
      "For nearly 15 years, William Spencer Reilly has been throwing a \u201c Sober St. Patrick's Day \u201d in New York City \u2014 which kicks off after the parade with Irish bands, dancers and food \u2014 and may soon expand the mission to Boston.",
      "The sober event's founder and chairman has always had his eye on Boston \"for all the obvious reasons.\u201d",
      "According to Reilly, it's about refocusing the typically-booze forward festivities on celebrating Irish heritage and honoring St. Patrick, the priest born in the late fourth century who was enslaved in Ireland and later returned to promote the spread of Christianity. It's also a chance to break hurtful stereotypes of Irish people.",
      "When he first proposed the idea of a sober event on such a booze-heavy day, he was met with incredulity and doubt over public interest. Now he's in talks with Boston\u2019s local leaders and believes there\u2019s finally enough interest and support to branch out next year.",
      "People generally seem more interested in being healthier, said Scelfo. That includes how they choose to spend their holidays.",
      "\u201cThe perils and pitfalls of alcohol are well-documented when not used responsibly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an intelligent young generation that\u2019s focused on health and wellness. And I think that that\u2019s a great thing.\"",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The first television ads dropped this week in the Ohio governor's race that's still more than a year off. The early onslaught by a super PAC allied with Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy drove home how quickly the former bellwether state 's ruling Republicans are seizing the spotlight and staking claims to five statewide executive offices that are opening in 2026.",

      "Fresh off a pair of difficult losses last year \u2014 the bitter defeat of three-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown to Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno, and the rejection by voters of the anti-gerrymandering amendment known as Issue 1 \u2014 the party's efforts at building anything close to a winning 2026 ticket have so far been muted, and for some, moving too slowly.",
      "Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director who helped guide Ohio through the early days of the pandemic, is running for governor as a Democrat \u2014 methodically building financial support and a statewide campaign. Though she gained recognition appearing on daily COVID-19 briefings that aired statewide in early 2020, Acton also is a newcomer to politics who lacks the political might of someone like Brown, who before last year had reliably won statewide victories going back decades.",
      "Meanwhile, only two other Democrats \u2014 southwest Ohio oncologist and first-time candidate Brian Hambley for secretary of state, and tainted former state Rep. Elliot Forhan for attorney general \u2014 have launched campaigns.",
      "The lack of activity accompanies Democrats\u2019 broader struggles nationally to coalesce around a strategy for countering actions by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk and their Republican allies in Congress. The debate over how to respond has divided party leaders, with some advocating for lying low \u2014 even as crowds of angry citizens throng congressional town halls, clog Capitol Hill phone lines and stage protests and marches in the streets. Others want to see the party combat November\u2019s bitter defeats at both the national and state levels more strenuously.",

Others say it's Republicans who are starting too early, not Democrats who are late.",
      "It's unclear if Brown will run, and, if he does, what office he might seek. It could be the governorship, setting up a contested primary with Acton. It could be the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by Vice President JD Vance, which successor Jon Husted must defend next year. Brown recently offered a treatise of sorts in The New Republic magazine for restoring the national Democratic Party with a pro-worker message, prompting speculation he might even be aspiring to the presidency.",
      "Once Brown's plans are known, plenty of other Democrats will be ready to go, predicted Greg Beswick, a former Ohio Democratic Party executive director.

It\u2019s the shuffling of the deck of folks that want to make sure they keep a job.\u201d",
      "That shuffle includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost running for governor, Auditor Keith Faber running for attorney general, Secretary of State Frank LaRose running for auditor and Treasurer Robert Sprague running for secretary of state.",
      "Besides Brown, other high profile Democrats believed to be weighing runs in 2026 are: former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, who lost a tighter than expected Senate race to Vance in 2022; Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, who won key Republican concessions for her party last session; and former U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach, a former Ohio attorney general candidate who led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under President Joe Biden.",
      "Katie Seewer, a spokesperson for the Ohio Democratic Party, said they anticipate at least one Democratic candidate will emerge for each of the statewide races. She said the party has been seeing lots of enthusiasm at organizing events across the state.",
      "\u201cPeople are fired up and ready to go,\u201d she said.",

      "The Senate is preparing to give final approval to a bill that could result in harsher prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate was preparing Friday to give final approval to a bill that could result in harsher prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers as both Republicans and Democrats seek to show they can act to rein in distribution of the deadly drug.",
      "The bill has already passed the House and has picked up Democratic support in the Senate, showing many in the party are eager to clamp down on fentanyl distribution following an election in which Republican Donald Trump harped on the problem. House Republicans passed a similar bill in 2023 with dozens of Democrats joining in support, but it languished in the Democratic-held Senate.",
      "Critics say the proposal repeats the mistakes of the so-called \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d which imprisoned millions of people addicted to drugs, particularly Black Americans.",
      "Now, with Republicans in control of the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune has prioritized the legislation, making it one of the early bills to send to Trump for his signature. The president has indicated he will sign it.",
      "Thune said this week the legislation \u201cgives law enforcement a critical tool to go after the criminals bringing this poison into our country and selling it on our streets.\u201d",
      "Called the HALT Fentanyl Act, the bill would permanently place all copycat versions of fentanyl \u2014 alterations of the drug that are often sold by traffickers \u2014 on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's list of most dangerous drugs, known as Schedule 1. The drugs had already been temporarily placed on the list since 2018, but that designation was set to expire at the end of the month. The move would mean an increase in criminal convictions for distributing fentanyl-related substances, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The legislation also seeks to make it easier to research the drugs.",
      "The bill passed the House last month with 98 Democrats and every Republican except Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky in support. In the Senate, a majority of Democrats have supported the push to bring it to final passage. Law enforcement groups have also supported the bill.",
      "\u201cThis is bipartisan because, frankly, fentanyl is a bipartisan problem,\" said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who has sponsored the bill.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have found agreement on trying to halt the flow of fentanyl into the United States, where it is blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year. Trump has said that halting the illicit flow of fentanyl is one of the top goals of his on-again-off-again tariff threats against Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "But some progressive Democrats said the bill was missing an opportunity to tackle root causes of addiction or to focus on stopping the drug from entering the U.S.",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a statement that support for the bill was \u201cenabling a political stunt at the expense of real solutions.\u201d",
      "The bill will \u201cdo little to actually solve the fentanyl crisis but will make it harder to research addiction and overdose reversal medication, disrupt communities and families by incarcerating rather than treating addiction, and divert resources from methods that work to disrupt the flow of fentanyl in the United States to strategies from the outdated War-on-Drugs solutions that do not work,\u201d Markey added.",
      "The average prison sentence for those convicted of trafficking fentanyl-related drugs was seven years and three months in 2023, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Almost 60% of those convicted were Black, 23% were Hispanic and 16% were white."

      "\u201cAs the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,\u201d Trump told the audience, with Attorney General Pam Bondi (who is technically the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer) and FBI Director Kash Patel in the audience.",
      "One of Trump's favorite campaign songs, \u201cYMCA,\u201d played after he wrapped up his nearly hourlong address inside the department's ceremonial Great Hall.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what Trump said, what the reality is and the significance of his words.",
      "\u201cThe same scum you have been dealing with for years. Guys like Andrew Weissman, deranged Jack Smith. There\u2019s a guy named Norm Eisen, I don\u2019t even know what he looks like. His name is Norm Eisen of CREW; he\u2019s been after me for nine years.\u201d",
      "Trump named lawyers and a legal nonprofit that he has tangled with over the years, which could serve as a roadmap for people he would like prosecuted by the officials in the room with him.",
      "Trump named lawyer Eisen, but misidentified him as running the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued to block Trump from running for reelection due to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Eisen was with the organization during part of Trump\u2019s first term but has since left.",
      "Trump rained vitriol on CREW as well as Eisen, who remains staunchly opposed to Trump and co-founded an online publication, The Contrarian, to take on the new administration. Still, Trump claimed Eisen has been \u201cviolent,\u201d which is laughable. He\u2019s a lawyer who\u2019s never used physical force toward Trump.",
      "Weissman was lead prosecutor for the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia during Trump\u2019s first term. One of the people Weissman convicted in that probe, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, watched the speech and was warmly introduced by Trump himself.",
      "Trump also name-checked Smith, who was the special prosecutor who filed charges against Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and for hoarding classified documents at his Florida resort.",
      "Notably, the president didn\u2019t name a single possible crime these lawyers or CREW committed other than opposing him.",
      "\u201cI believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they are really corrupt and they are illegal. What they do is illegal.\u201d",
      "This was a remarkable moment \u2014 the president of the United States telling his Department of Justice that he believes the media are illegal because they write bad things about him.",
      "Needless to say, CNN and MSNBC (which Trump tweaked by changing its initials) are not actually part of the Democratic Party. No matter if you think their coverage leans in that direction, there\u2019s no actual, legal connection.",
      "Even if there was, the First Amendment allows political groups to criticize a rival politician. It certainly allows the media to do so, regardless of any perceived ideological bias.",
      "\"What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.\u201d",
      "This is one of Trump's favorite subjects \u2014 how he didn't really lose the 2020 election. He did, though.",
      "Trump has claimed falsely that widespread fraud cost him the 2020 election, but the evidence says otherwise. Trump lost dozens of court challenges, including some before judges he appointed, his own attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have tipped the election, and reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his loss all affirmed Biden\u2019s win.",
      "It's unclear who \u201cthe people who did this\u201d are in Trump's threat, but when a president says someone should go to jail while addressing the Department of Justice \u2014 especially about something that never happened \u2014 that's significant.",
      "\u201cI pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated. We removed the senior FBI officials who misdirected resources to send SWAT teams after grandmothers and J6 hostages. And it was a great honor for me, a great honor to fire James Comey.\u201d",
      "Trump claimed he'd end what he called \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Department of Justice, but then quickly boasted of pardoning those who attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election loss on Jan. 6.",
      "Trump also boasted of firing Comey, who was the FBI director in his first term. It was one of Trump's most controversial acts then, but seems almost quaint now. The man whom Trump nominated to replace Comey, Christopher Wray, stepped aside in December after years of being targeted by Trump, who has now replaced him with Patel, a loyalist who never worked in the bureau.",
      "The president boasting of firing top FBI officials is a clear signal to those inside the Department of Justice.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to scare the hell out of the judges. And they do it. How do you stop it? ... What do you do to get rid of it? You convict Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump has personally singled out judges who ruled against him for attack since he first ran for president in 2016. But, remarkably, Trump implied that the adverse legal decisions against him have been because his opponents are threatening judges.",
      "In reality, the judge who presided over Trump\u2019s criminal in New York, Juan Merchan, received threats after Trump repeatedly attacked him and his family. Judicial organizations have reported a sharp rise in threats as Trump increasingly complained the legal system was \u201crigged\u201d against him as he fought four separate prosecutions during his campaign.",
      "Trump did accurately note negative coverage that conservative justices on the nation\u2019s highest court have received over some of their rulings and conduct. He has reason to want those justices to be sympathetic to him because several of his administration\u2019s initiatives are tangled up in litigation headed straight to the Supreme Court."

A GSA planning document dated March 10 lists the dates when many of the cancellations are expected to go into effect. That does not mean all the locations will close by those dates, but agencies would have to either negotiate new leases or move elsewhere if they remain open.

    "story": [
      "Ron Nessen, the veteran broadcast journalist who served as press secretary for President Gerald Ford, has died at 90",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ron Nessen, a veteran broadcast journalist who was press secretary for President Gerald Ford and sought to restore the integrity that the position had lost during the Nixon administration, has died. He was 90.",
      "Nessen died Wednesday in Bethesda, Maryland, his son, Edward Nessen, confirmed Friday.",
      "Nessen replaced Jerald F. terHorst in September 1974 just six weeks into Ford\u2019s presidency after terHorst resigned in protest over Ford\u2019s pardon of former President Richard Nixon. Nessen had covered Ford\u2019s tenure as vice president in the final months of a 12-year stint as a television correspondent with NBC News. He was the first journalist to come to the White House post from a broadcast background.",
      "Nessen had developed a positive working relationship with Ford even though he asked difficult questions about the Watergate scandal as it eroded Nixon\u2019s presidency. The position of press secretary, held then by Ron Ziegler, lacked credibility as the slow-moving scandal revealed a White House press operation that could not be trusted in its public pronouncements.",
      "\u201cI will never knowingly lie to you, never knowingly mislead the White House press corps,\u201d Nessen, then 40, told reporters when he took over as Ford\u2019s spokesman. He added, \u201cIf I do, you\u2019d be justified in questioning my usefulness in this job.\u201d He also said he saw his main duty as providing news and information to the American people, not selling the president\u2019s policies or necessarily agreeing with them.",
      "One prominent trait for the new press secretary was a sense of humor. (He told reporters on his first day, \u201cI'm a Ron, not a Ziegler,\" a play off his boss' remark that \u201cI am a Ford, not a Lincoln.\u201d) But, by his own admission, Nessen was at times short-tempered, thin-skinned and sarcastic when dealing with journalists.",
      "Nessen later pointed with pride to getting reporters more access to the president, including allowing follow-up questions at news conferences and having Ford appear on a live network television news program. The appearance on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was a first for a president.",
      "During his two years and four months as White House press secretary, Nessen may have drawn the most attention to himself by hosting television's \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d then in its initial season. He was the first \u201cSNL\u201d host to come from outside the entertainment world. The April 17, 1976, episode aired during Ford\u2019s reelection bid and included taped appearances by the president, who likely hoped to come across as a good sport in the face of the show\u2019s constant satirical jabs.",
      "The post-broadcast criticism Nessen endured was mostly about the propriety and wisdom of a press secretary participating in a comedy show that skewered his boss, not Nessen's ability to deliver a punch line. He later said he worried privately that hosting had been an ego-driven mistake since the liberal-leaning show's skits continued mocking Ford as a bumbler and dullard.",
      "Ronald H. Nessen was born May 25, 1934, in Washington. His father owned a general merchandise store in the city and his mother was its bookkeeper.",
      "Nessen worked in radio as a high school student and while studying at Shepherd College in West Virginia and American University in Washington, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1959. During the 1950s, he was a newscaster for WEPM in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and WARL in Arlington, Virginia, and later reported for the Montgomery County Sentinel in Rockville, Maryland.",
      "Nessen was a reporter and editor for United Press International in Washington from 1956-62, then joined NBC News as a television correspondent. He covered Lyndon Johnson's White House, civil rights and the 1964 presidential campaign and was sent to Vietnam five times, his first tour ending in a near-fatal chest wound from a grenade fragment. He also covered national affairs and international assignments for the network before focusing on the Ford vice presidency.",
      "After Ford\u2019s defeat by Jimmy Carter in 1976, Nessen turned to writing and freelance work. He was a top executive with the Washington public relations firm Marston & Rothenberg Public Affairs from 1980-84 before managing radio news operations for the Mutual Broadcasting System and the NBC Radio Network. He later worked as a public affairs executive for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association and the Brookings Institution.",
      "He also wrote two memoirs, \u201cIt Sure Looks Different from the Inside\u201d (1978) and \u201cMaking the News, Taking the News\u201d (2011). He also wrote the novels \u201cThe First Lady\u201d (1979) and \u201cThe Hour\u201d (1984) as well as three mysteries in the 1990s co-written with his wife at the time, Johanna Neuman.",
      "Looking back on his career change, Nessen acknowledged in his 2011 memoir that he wanted the job as Ford's spokesman in part to see what it was like to be a newsmaker. He concluded that he preferred the journalist\u2019s role and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m more comfortable as an observer than as a participant.\u201d",
      "Nessen is survived by his son, daughter Caren Nessen, a sister, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",
      "\u2014-",
      "Daniel retired from The Associated Press in 2023. Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Kissimmee, Florida, contributed to this report."

    "story": [
      "The Senate has swiftly approved legislation that would allow the District of Columbia to keep its budget intact",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate swiftly approved legislation late Friday that would allow the District of Columbia to keep its budget intact, rather than roll back to 2024, fixing a provision that had drawn protests from the mayor and residents warning it would require $1 billion in cuts to services.",
      "The bill passed unanimously, without dissent, and now heads to the House. Lawmakers there are on recess, but expected to consider it when they return in late March.",
      "\u201cThe issue here is just allowing the D.C. government to proceed to spend its own tax revenues,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, during a brief floor debate.",
      "Collins said the legislation would correct the situation that arose from the broader package to prevent a government shutdown, and assured, \u201cThere are no federal dollars involved.\u201d",
      "After Friday\u2019s vote, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser released a statement saying: \u201cSenate approval today is a major first step as we continue working with the House of Representatives on final passage to ensure critical services provided in the Nation\u2019s Capital, including our police officers, firefighters, teachers, medical services and hospital network, aren\u2019t haphazardly cut in the middle of the fiscal year. DC is proud of our strong financial management, balanced budgets, and strong bond ratings.\u201d",
      "The sudden focus on the District of Columbia startled its leaders and residents, who rushed to Capitol Hill this week to protest the way Congress was interfering with its governance. Residents have been flooding senators\u2019 offices, demanding the change.",
      "While the District won the power of Home Rule during the Nixon administration, it is facing new threats as Congress, which maintains ultimate oversight of the region of 700,000 people, is in the hands of Republican majorities who have suggested more federal control.",
      "The problem arose in the House Republican-passed package to fund the federal government past Friday's deadline to prevent a shutdown. It failed to include a routine provision allowing the District of Columbia's budget, which is made up mostly of its own tax revenues but subject to approvals by Congress.

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats were grim Friday as they left Washington after a brutal 10-week stretch that consistently showed the limits of their power in the minority \u2014 and culminated with a deeply personal rupture over how to best counter President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cEveryone made hard decisions, right? Really hard decisions,\u201d said Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, of the position in which Democrats found themselves over the last week as they had to decide between voting for a Republican spending bill they hated and shutting down the government. \u201cIt\u2019s like two horrible things, and you can\u2019t imagine either one.\u201d",
      "Internal dissension burst into the open Thursday evening after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would vote to move forward on the Trump-backed spending measure, ensuring its eventual passage even though Democrats said it would give Trump broad discretion on decisions that are traditionally left to Congress.",
      "The intraparty backlash was unusually swift as activists and House Democrats who had uniformly opposed the bill heaped criticism on Schumer. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Schumer\u2019s New York colleague, joined other top party members in a statement saying, \u201cWe will not be complicit.\"",
      "The heat on Schumer came after several other Democratic setbacks in the dizzying weeks since Trump\u2019s inauguration, and as Republicans have only become more unified under the president\u2019s second term.",
      "Republicans confirmed Trump\u2019s entire Cabinet swiftly and with little internal disagreement, denying Democrats the needed votes to block nominees they saw as extreme, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Democrats were also unable to stop a series of moves by Trump\u2019s administration that would normally be left to Congress under the law, including mass firings across the government. Adding to their challenges, the outlook for future Senate elections grew even gloomier after Democrats in three swing states \u2014 the latest being Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire \u2014 announced their retirement.",
      "The days leading up to Friday\u2019s vote on government spending were particularly bleak after several hourslong meetings that became contentious. Senate Democrats repeatedly left the meetings stone-faced and refusing to talk with reporters. The angst was particularly acute among rank-and-file who have spent years messaging about the perils of shutdowns.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a momentous decision,\u201d said Shaheen, one of nine Democrats who voted with Schumer to keep the government open.",
      "The tension was unusually high after Senate Democrats had remained solidly unified through Trump\u2019s first term and through most of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, when Democrats passed several major policy bills and held the Senate against perceived odds in the 2022 midterm elections.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to Schumer\u2019s decision was mixed. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who voted not to move forward on the spending measure, wouldn\u2019t answer when asked by reporters if she still has confidence in the Democratic leader. But Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who voted to move forward, said Schumer \u201cis showing leadership\u201d by taking a stand.",
      "Schumer and Democrats in his caucus say they believe they will eventually gain more political ground as members of their party become more motivated, and as they continue to criticize Trump on what they predict will be the economic ramifications of his policies.",
      "On Friday, as he walked into the Senate to vote, Schumer said Democrats will \u201cresume pounding away at Donald Trump\u201d and arguing that he\u2019s hurting the middle class economically. \u201cIt\u2019s brought down his numbers some, and we\u2019re going to keep at it, keep at it, keep at it.\u201d",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said that spending vote was a \u201ctough political call,\u201d but the party would continue to be unified on the economic message.",
      "\u201cAll of our base wants us to fight, and I'm with them,\u201d said Welch, who voted not to move forward on the spending measure. But he questioned whether the party ever had any leverage, as Trump was preparing to blame them if there was a shutdown.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Democrats need to \u201ckeep their eyes on the ball.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe stark reality is, we\u2019re the minority in the House, we\u2019re the minority in the Senate, and we don\u2019t control the White House, so we need to use every tool as nimbly and ingeniously as we can,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cBut most importantly, the growing anger.\u201d"

Many also are freezing hiring as the Trump administration threatens to take away federal money over their handling of a wide range of issues from antisemitism complaints to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Mira Polishook, a Duke University research technician, recently heard from one of the programs she applied to that \"government decisions\u201d had left it unable to offer her admission. She applied to the National Science Foundation\u2019s Graduate Research Fellowship which would guarantee three years of graduate school funding, but lately NSF has been silent on timing for awards. She's uncertain the agency will have funding at all.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s made me feel like I am in limbo.\u201d",
      "Cuts to NIH funding have been delayed by a legal challenge from a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions. But the uncertainty already has put some projects on hold as universities deal also with delays or cuts in grants from other agencies including USAID and NSF.",
      "Admissions in some graduate programs have have been cut in half or paused altogether, said Emilya Ventriglia, president of UAW 2750, the union representing around 5,000 early career researchers at NIH facilities in Bethesda, Maryland, and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAt this rate, with the hiring freeze, there may be no Ph.D. students next year if it\u2019s not lifted soon, because usually people make their decisions by April,\u201d Ventriglia said.",
      "Ventriglia's research focuses on how the brain responds to anti-depressants. But now she is unable to continue recruiting another researcher she planned to mentor this spring. She said she also is worried that new purchasing restrictions, and firings of employees who processed those purchases, mean she will be unable to acquire reagents she needs for experiments.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re expecting this to play out for generations,\u201d said Levin Kim, the president of a union that represents 8,000 academic workers at the University of Washington.",
      "The financial and emotional toll on those navigating the uncertainty is mounting.",
      "\u201cI love the work that I do. It\u2019s all I want to do,\u201d said Natalie Antenucci, a first-year graduate student at the University of North Carolina. Her work at a lab researching the ways social experiences can impact health is funded by an NIH grant. \u201cI\u2019m not in a financial position where I could continue to do it if there wasn\u2019t funding available for this sort of work.\u201d",
      "Some American students are looking to institutions overseas.",
      "Marleigh Hutchinson, who will graduate from Kansas State University in May with an undergraduate degree in environmental engineering, said getting hired in the U.S. as a graduate teaching assistant or researcher seems unlikely because of the uncertainty.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always told people I do want to work in the international development space. I want to work on food security and water security issues,\u201d she said, \u201cand if that\u2019s something that the United States is no longer going to value, then I would like to go somewhere else.\u201d",
      "Hutchinson was notified last month that funding was slashed to a USAID-funded lab where she was working. Its focus was making crops more resistant to drought in places like Africa as the world grows warmer.",
      "At the University of Nebraska, an institute that works to improve water management for agriculture offered to host a doctoral candidate in hydrology from Ghana and was talking to three other international students. But it had to rescind the offer after it lost USAID funding, said Nicole Lefore, associate director of the school's Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute.",

And so bringing in generations of students for education and agriculture in the U.S. helped to create those personal connections and then later scientific and diplomatic connections.

      "He made the comment during a four-day visit to Bangladesh where he is assessing the plight of more than 1 million Rohingya refugees whose future remained uncertain over possible aid cuts soon.",
      "The U.N. would do everything possible to arrange adequate funding for the Rohingya refugees after recent announcement of dramatic aid cuts by the U.S. and other countries in Europe, Guterres said. As a result, the U.N.'s food agency recently said it would have no option but to cut food aid by half for the Rohingya from April if they fail to arrange adequate fund to feed them.",

A large proportion of the millions of dollars needed for supporting Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh come from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Bangladesh had said that the halt of international aid money would stop other projects in the country but that funding for Rohingya refugees would continue to flow.",
      "A letter from the U.N.'s World Food Program earlier this month said cuts to food rations could take effect from next month at Cox\u2019s Bazar, home to dozens of camps housing Rohingya refugees. The WFP said the food rations could be reduced to $6, from the current $12.50 per month, unless adequate funding is secured.",

      "The U.S. has been the top donor to Bangladesh for Rohingya refugees, providing the U.N. with emergency food and nutrition assistance.

      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

    "summary": "If it does collapse, who will pay and how much?",
    "story": [
      "The fate of debt-laden Thames Water could soon become clearer later on Monday.",
      "The Court of Appeal is expected to decide whether the company's plan to borrow a further \u00a33bn to avoid collapse can proceed or whether it upholds objections from a small group of creditors and Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard.",
      "If it approves the plan, Thames Water lives on long enough to attempt a restructuring of debts and garnering of new investment. If it approves the appeal, the company is likely to fall into a government-backed administration within weeks or days.",
      "Either outcome is guaranteed to generate strong reaction. Customer bills and supply are unlikely to be affected - either way, bills are due to go up.",
      "The company \u2013 and the vast majority of lenders - insists that a government rescue will end up costing taxpayers billions, set back the timetable to fix this broken business and send both suppliers and would-be investors running for the hills.",
      "Others, including Mr Maynard and academics like Professor Sir Dieter Helm, argue that the Thames plan mainly serves the narrow interests of its current lenders who stand to lose more of their money in an administration than they would if they can keep the show on the road \u2013 particularly since the extra money they want to lend them comes with a very hefty interest rate.",
      "The public interest is best served, they say, by using the same mechanism employed when energy company Bulb went bust.",
      "In that case, the cost was initially estimated by the Treasury to be \u00a36bn but ended up costing close to zero as energy prices moved in the government's favour.",
      "So who is right?",
      "The answer depends largely \u2013 but not entirely \u2013 on how much one estimates a government rescue would cost taxpayers.",
      "Thames itself has presented an estimate of up to \u00a34bn. While Charlie Maynard has presented a figure of \u00a366m. Others have said it wouldn't cost taxpayers a dime in the long run. A staggering range.",
      "Ofwat, the regulator, seems to have sided with the company. In submissions to the courts, Ofwat presented the \u00a34bn figure and Mr Maynard's \u00a366m and chose only to comment that Mr Maynard's figure was the least evidenced.",
      "The Secretary of State Steve Reed has said that government involvement \"would cost billions and take years\".",
      "Eminent economist and infrastructure expert Professor Sir Dieter Helm argues that it could end up costing the government zero as the proceeds of a sale back to the private sector would eventually cover the costs incurred in the short to medium term by the government.",
      "A person close to the situation said \"the idea that SAR is cost-free is fanciful and dangerous. It's time for the reality to be recognised. SAR is not a good outcome.\"",
      "Most importantly, the BBC understands that a figure in the billions may be included in the OBR's official forecast under the \"risks to the outlook\" section.",
      "Watch on iPlayer - Thames Water: Inside the Crisis",
      "Watch on iPlayer - Thames Water: Inside the Crisis",
      "The correct answer is that no one can be quite sure.",
      "What is uncontested is that in a so called Special Administration Regime (SAR), the financial and operational risks of the company transfer from the private to the public sector.",
      "In the short to medium term, the taxpayer will bear financial risks that are substantial. Thames has a plan to invest nearly \u00a320bn over the next five years while it only has revenue of \u00a32.3bn a year.",
      "The extra money comes from upfront borrowing that the company pays back through customer bills over many years. In a SAR, that upfront cost would be borne by the taxpayer.",
      "Longer term, when the company is sold back to the private sector, that money could be recouped \u2013 plus interest - from the sale proceeds.",
      "It's very hard to estimate what Thames would sell for. Well-performing water companies sell for around 50% of the value of their assets. Thames assets are worth around \u00a318bn on paper \u2013 which would give a figure of \u00a39bn.",
      "Given the age of those assets, the high operational costs of working around high population density and its miserable track record, it's very unlikely that Thames would sell for anywhere near that.",
      "Whenever the government rescues something with the intention of selling back to the private sector \u2013 it is always possible, likely even, they may get less money back than they put in. There are many examples of this - including British Steel and the RBS.",
      "As far as the government is concerned, rescuing Thames comes with a cost that would affect the public finances negatively over the course of this parliament.",
      "Given the well-publicised but self-imposed constraints on the Chancellor, it's not hard to see why the government would like to avoid it if possible.",
      "The other argument advanced by Mr Maynard in his appeal against the \u00a33bn private lifeline \u2013 is that it will well end up being paid for by customers. Ofwat again decided to intervene on this, writing to the court that the company would be barred from recouping financing costs from customers.",
      "Thames itself argues there are other reasons a SAR would not be in the public interest. New administrators parachuted in to caretake a vast sprawling business would be ill-equipped to take on the task of turning around a company whose new management insists had formulated a clear plan.",
      "Thames would be a company in limbo with little momentum to get on with the mammoth task. People close to that plan fear suppliers could also be wary of extended payment terms under government-backed supervision.",
      "Those arguments may be nonsense.",
      "Attempts to prolong the life in its current form of a company laid low by years of under-investment, overgenerous pay and dividends, poor regulation and changing climate may be doomed.",
      "But what many, including government officials and ministers, ask themselves is \u2013 what is there to lose by letting the company have a go at restructuring and potentially redeeming itself over the next few years?",
      "If it fails, it fails and Special Administration is a mechanism that's been built into the system since privatisation and will still be there in six months, a year \u2013 by which time we will know whether they can do it or not.",

      "\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.",
      "He says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.",
      "Back at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.",
      "\"We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,\" she explains, before pausing.  \"We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order.\"",
      "She says that she doesn't know whether the US buyer understands that tariffs will now apply. \"He has to ask Mr Trump [why]\".",
      "As for what comes next?  \"These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,\" says Ms Goodman.",
      "Like many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future."

      "The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness.",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin.",

      "\"The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter.\"",

      "Gold touched a record $3,004.86 per ounce on Friday, with prices having risen by 14% since the start of 2025.",
      "Gold is seen as a safer asset for investors and is often sought after in times of economic instability.",
      "The escalating trade war between the US and many of its largest trading partners has unsettled financial markets and raised concerns about the impact on economies and consumers across the world.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes charged on businesses importing goods from overseas, has fuelled fears of price inflation, which has driven investors to gold.",
      "When tariffs are imposed on goods, businesses face extra costs, which could be passed on through the price tags of the products sold to consumers - increasing the cost of living.",
      "On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of the trade war.",
      "The announcement was in response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of the bloc's first retaliation to Trump's blanket tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US from any country.",
      "The US president has also raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "\"In a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing tariff changes, appetite for gold remains strong,\" said Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered.",
      "Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested there were two main drivers behind the gold price at present.",
      "\"Between Trump's tariffs and social media comments and the ongoing tensions in both the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine, uncertainty is high and seems to be rising,\" she said.",
      "\"Markets hate uncertainty. This dynamic has helped to drive the gold price to new highs.\"",
      "The second big driver was central banks buying up gold, Ms Hasler said, but the exact reasons for this were difficult to determine. \"It's probably safe to assume that at least part of the reason is a desire to diversify reserves away from US dollars.",
      "\"Both of the above drivers remain intact and I can't see them diminishing in the near future.\"",
      "Peaks and troughs of the gold price have occurred at some of the key moments in economic history. At the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007, investors bought gold as a haven asset, which led to a rise in its price.",
      "Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, cited World Gold Council figures, which showed central banks had added some 1,045 tonnes of gold to their reserves last year - the third year in a row more than 1,000 tonnes had been bought.",
      "He said we were in an \"era in which gold is really starting to shine\".",
      "Since the metal dipped below $1,200 an ounce in late 2018, Mr Mould said prices had \"marched inexorably higher\", driven by several factors including the Covid pandemic and higher government deficits pushing investors to \"warm to gold once more\".",
      "\"Quite which of these issues is now the main driver of gold's renaissance is hard to divine, especially as Donald Trump's tariffs are prompting a debate about how inflationary (or stagflationary) they may prove to be, and how effective they may be at funding the new US President's hoped-for tax cuts,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "The boss of Asda has warned there is no \"quick fix\" to boost the supermarket\u2019s flagging sales as it tries to win back customers from rivals.",
      "Allan Leighton, Asda\u2019s executive chairman, said profits would be lower this year due to investment plans aimed at lowering prices for customers and improving the availability of products.",
      "Britain's third largest supermarket has been struggling to keep up with its competitors, losing market share to bigger rivals such as Tesco and discounters Aldi and Lidl last year.",
      "After releasing its latest financial figures on Friday, Mr Leighton said the grocer was aiming for its prices to be five to 10% cheaper than its rivals going forward.",
      "Asda revealed on Friday that sales, excluding fuel, fell almost 1% to \u00a321.7bn last year.",
      "Mr Leighton said the sales figures were \"disappointing\", but added that profits being up 6% on 2023 to \u00a31.1bn were \"OK-ish\".",
      "\"Obviously there are one or two things that we need to fix,\" he added. \"Our pricing, our availability, and our range architecture - that has all started...we're starting to make some progress.\"",
      "Mr Leighton said the supermarket was looking to put more staff on the shop floor, but acknowledged regaining customers' trust in the brand would take time.",
      "\"We're flagging a significant investment back into the business, and that is going to materially reduce our profit in the short term as we rebuild the business and we rebuild our market share,\" he said.",

      "It has been without a permanent chief executive since 2021. Its co-owner Mohsin Issa stepped down from running the supermarket last year.",
      "In January, Mr Leighton, who returned to Asda in November after 20 years where he was previously chief executive, launched major price cuts - reintroducing the \"Rollback\" promotion that was first used in the 1990s.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "story": [
      "Taxpayers and the pension schemes of Thames Water workers would both suffer if the UK's largest water company was temporarily nationalised, the water regulator and Thames' pension trustees have warned.",
      "Ofwat has not disputed that placing Thames under government control in the event the debt-laden company collapsed could end up costing taxpayers billions of pounds.",
      "Some 12,000 current and former employees could also see future pension entitlements reduced, according to documents seen by the BBC.",
      "The future of Thames Water is in the balance as the Court of Appeal considers whether a \u00a33bn emergency loan to the troubled utility giant can go ahead.",
      "Thames and the majority of its lenders have backed a plan that would see the company, which has a \u00a320bn debt pile, borrow a further \u00a33bn to keep it afloat long enough to complete a restructure.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. It is expected to run out of cash completely by mid-April.",
      "The \u00a33bn rescue loan was approved following a crucial High Court battle last month, but a smaller group of lenders worried they stood to lose the most and Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard, who argued that piling on more debt was not in the public interest, launched an appeal.",
      "The Court of Appeal has been hearing arguments over whether the loan should be granted, with a decision expected early next week.",
      "Thames Water secures \u00a33bn lifeline after court ruling",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "Documents seen by the BBC revealed Ofwat rejected claims from Maynard that Thames adding to its debt pile would mean higher bills and also that a collapse into administration would result in a negligible cost to taxpayers.",
      "In a letter to the court, the water regulator insisted that Thames would be barred from recovering any additional interest payments from customer bills.",
      "It said that it had seen \"no evidence to support\" a figure put forward by Maynard that administration would cost the government as little as \u00a366m.",
      "The regulator did not comment on Thames's estimate that it would cost taxpayers up to \u00a34bn.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said government intervention in Thames Water would \"cost billions and take years\".",
      "Separately, the trustees for some 12,000 Thames Water pension scheme members have expressed concern that they \"could be significantly and detrimentally impacted\" should the company enter administration.",
      "If Thames were to collapse, those members would likely be transferred to the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund, which provides lower future benefits than those promised by the original scheme.",
      "Thames is hoping that the additional \u00a33bn in borrowing will provide it with enough time to start addressing the many problems it has.",
      "The company has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The company's first priority, if the loan is approved, would be to reduce its huge debt pile, by requiring lenders to accept a discount in what they are owed.",
      "Second would be to appeal a decision by Ofwat that it can only raise bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years. Thames has argued it needs to increase by 53% over the period.",
      "Its third move, which is connected to both of the above, would be to attract new investors to pump money into a business that has attracted public anger and regulatory fines.",
      "While the government, the regulator and the pension trustees are keen to avoid a collapse, there are many who think that Thames Water needs to be put out of its misery - rather than lurching from one financial and operational crisis to another.",
      "What Ofwat and the pension trustees point out is that is likely to come at a cost to both taxpayers and workers."

      "His order - which was followed by another from Maryland - applies to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at a range of departments, including defence, energy, treasury, and veterans affairs.",

      "Ineos Automotive, the car maker owned by Manchester United co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has recalled more than 7,000 of its sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the US.",
      "The firm said \"in a small number of cases\" Grenadier SUV doors are opening while cars are being driven \"increasing the risk of injury to passengers inside the vehicle\".",
      "\"Due to insufficient application of grease, an exterior door release button may remain in the depressed position, preventing the door from closing securely\", a spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "To fix the problem, Ineos said it will replace all door button assemblies on the affected vehicles, free of charge.",
      "The recall affects Ineos' Grenadier SUVs produced between 6 July 2023 and 19 April 2024.",
      "The door button mechanism on affected vehicles may have been assembled without enough grease in them, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) filing.",

      "A company spokesperson said: \"We are undertaking a campaign to replace the door lock mechanisms on all affected vehicles as quickly as possible. Owners of all impacted vehicles are being contacted directly.\"",
      "The recall is the latest issue faced by the car company, which last year had to temporarily pause manufacturing after one of its parts suppliers became insolvent.",
      "Launched in 2022, the Grenadier was the first vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive. It is inspired by the iconic Land Rover Defender.",
      "Sir Jim's decision to start the car company was motivated by his disappointment over Jaguar Land Rover's decision to stop making the Defender.",
      "In 2020, the entrepreneur, who had campaigned for Leave in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, announced that the vehicle would be assembled in France, putting an end to hopes that it would be made at a plant in Wales.",
      "According to the company, there are currently about 20,000 Grenadiers on the road in 50 countries around the world.",
      "Ineos Automotive lost more than 1.4 billion euros (\u00a31.1bn, $1.5bn) before tax in 2023, according to a filing with the UK registry Companies House.",

      "Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible.",
      "Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city.",
      "\"The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,\" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications.",

It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,\" says Mr Dagilis.",

      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",

In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",

      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",
      "\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.",

      "Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.",
      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",
      "Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".",
      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",

      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",

      "Why did it take so long to reach an agreement?",
      "Both sides were entrenched. For two years, they were in conflict, with the presenters off screen for half of that time.",
      "Contracts are binding. Employees remain on full pay while internal disputes are resolved. But this one took a long time, and they continued to fight when they returned to work. Only, on the brink of the tribunal, was there a resolution.",
      "The BBC will have had licence fee payers in mind when weighing up whether to proceed to a full tribunal or settle. It apparently decided it wasn't worth going through three damaging weeks, with all the headlines and media attention that would have generated.",
      "A settlement is always likely to bring down costs. The impact of a tribunal can be substantial, and there is also the potential for appeals and further hearings that increase the financial impact.",
      "But the optics of the last two years, ending in a settlement, aren't good. And there is frustration inside the BBC about the impact of it all, at a time when budgets are shrinking."

      "Disney's live-action remake of Snow White is set to be released in UK cinemas next week, marking the latest efforts by the film studio to revive a beloved old classic.",
      "But the film, which stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, has faced several issues throughout its production.",
      "The movie is being released amid a debate about how the seven dwarfs are represented on screen, while Zegler has made headlines for critical comments about the original 1937 film.",
      "The European premiere was held on Wednesday at a castle in Northern Spain, instead of a more traditional and high-profile location such as London's Leicester Square.",
      "Dwarfism debate",
      "The debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\".",
      "But this week, other actors with Dwarfism have said they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, performer Choon Tan said the decision to use CGI was \"absolutely absurd and discriminating in a sense\".",
      "\"There really is nothing wrong casting someone with dwarfism as a dwarf in any given opportunity,\" he said.",
      "\"As long as we are treated equally and with respect, we're usually more than happy to take on any acting roles that are suitable for us,\" he added.",
      "Another performer, Blake Johnston, told the newspaper that \"we have plenty of dwarf actors out there who are dying for roles like this\".",
      "He said he also said he believed Disney had \"succumb to peer pressure on political correctness, which has now given top dwarf actors less work\".",
      "Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, criticised the film in 2022 during an interview with podcaster Marc Maron.",
      "\"I was a little taken aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White,\" he said, referring to Colombian-American actress Zegler.",
      "\"You're progressive in one way, but then you're still making that backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox? I guess I'm not loud enough.\"",
      "The actor had previously spoken about the representation of dwarfism, saying it was \"bad writing\" to make it a \"dominant character trait\".",
      "In a statement released after Dinklage's comments, Disney said they were \"taking a different approach with these seven characters\" and had made their decision to use CGI after \"consulting with members of the dwarf community\".",
      "Pared-down premiere",
      "The film's European premiere took place on Wednesday at a remote castle in Spain, which was the inspiration behind the castle in the 1937 original animated film.",
      "Zegler performed a rendition of original song Waiting On a Wish at the event on Wednesday evening in Segrovia, north-West of Madrid.",
      "Most media outlets were not invited to the medieval castle, and Zegler instead performed to a relatively small crowd.",
      "The Los Angeles premiere, meanwhile, will be reportedly smaller than usual for a film of this magnitude, with the stars only expected to pose for photographs and speak to Disney's in-house crews.",
      "News journalists have not been invited to attend the red carpet and therefore will not have the opportunity to interview the film's cast and creatives.",
      "However, the cast are taking part in a few select sit-down interviews with some outlets as part of a press junket which is taking place this week.",
      "Other controversies",
      "The debate about the seven dwarfs is not the only controversy which has surrounded the film, which has reportedly cost \u00a3217m to make.",
      "Early in the film's production, there was controversy around Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "It was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Halle Bailey, a black actress, was cast in another recent Disney live-action movie, The Little Mermaid. Both actresses faced abuse online after their casting was announced.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Elsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has publicly taken a pro-Palestine stance, whilst Gadot is Israeli and served in the country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they jointly presented an award at last week's Oscars.",
      "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the latest in a long line of classic animated Disney stories which have been remade as live-action films.",

      "As Donatella Versace steps down from designing after 27 years at the helm of the Italian brand, the fashion world has been reflecting on her achievements and what this means for the future.",
      "The 69-year-old took over the family business after her brother Gianni was murdered in 1997, with many unsure whether she had what it takes to steer the fashion house.",
      "Her appointment was seen at the time as \"a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family,\" the Guardian's fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley wrote.",
      "But she proved the doubters wrong, anointing herself in the process as a global fashion icon.",
      "She leaves the job as \"one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history\", Cartner-Morley added.",

      "As singer and Versace ambassador Dua Lipa put it in a tribute on Instagram: \"No-one does it like you @donatella_versace!!!!!\"",
      "She did it all with \"grit, kindness and, even in the troughs of addiction, an infectious sense of humour\", the Telegraph's head of fashion Lisa Armstrong wrote.",
      "However,  Versace \"never set a fashion agenda\" under Donatella as it had under her brother, Armstrong added - but her \"nose for a story could nevertheless produce fashion magic\".",
      "Her magic moments included dressing Jennifer Lopez in the green jungle dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards, generating so much interest that Google created its image search function.",
      "As former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale takes over, Donatella will now become an ambassador for the Versace brand.",
      "The big question is what that means for both the company and Donatella herself, who has poured her life into the company, dealing with grief, drug addiction and divorce along the way?",
      "Speculation is growing over whether the company will be sold to the Prada Group by its current owner Capri Holdings.",

      "Prada has been credited with developing a strong vision in recent years, which has translated to healthy sales during a climate of slowdown in the fashion economy.",
      "Imran Amed, CEO of The Business of Fashion, told the BBC World Service that \"Versace is one of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry\" and has \"a very clear design and brand DNA\".",
      "He believes it \"would be a mistake to dilute\" the company or merge it with another, so hopes that if Versace is bought, the vision is to grow it into something bigger.",
      "Amed said Versace makes about $1bn (\u00a3772m) a year, while rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci make $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) and $8bn (\u00a36.2bn) respectively.",
      "Some have touted that Versace's failure to expand into the beauty industry and other affordable luxuries is why it has been left behind financially by its rivals.",
      "Luisa Zargani, Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear Daily, said Donatella had probably stepped back because she knows a \"moment of creative upheaval\" is coming for the brand.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about the future of Versace and for the last few years she has been very involved with all her charity work, so she will continue to do [that] while continuing to be part of the Versace family,\" she told BBC News.",
      "Zargani said Donatella \"has always championed young designers\" such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Anderson and Anthony Vaccarello, and she expects her to continue to be involved as Vitale moves from Miu Miu.",
      "\"[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,\" Zargani added.",
      "Friedman said Donatella had probably been thinking about her succession plan \"for a while\".",
      "\"There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,\" she told the World Service's Newshour.",
      "Friedman called her replacement \"a very talented designer\", adding: \"He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period.\"",
      "Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was \"mind boggling\" when \"every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period\".",
      "Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added.",
      "\"She wasn't the person toiling away with pattern-making back in the atelier, but she really did prove herself, and more credit to her.\"",
      "Donatella's final show earlier this month was staged in a tram station in northern Milan, drawing some of the world's biggest celebrities - once again showcasing how her star power has helped keep the brand a talking point in the fashion world.",
      "Friedman said the show, which featured the brand's signature bold aesthetic, \"reflected the fuzziness around the fate of Versace\" by lacking any clear direction.",
      "Her exit was not announced at the show, but many speculated it was coming because the collection featured references to her late brother's final designs from autumn/winter 1997.",
      "Everyone is now talking about what Donatella does next.",
      "A book or documentary about her would undoubtedly be well received. She is also an advocate for several women's and LGBTQ charities, so could increase her input into those in the future. But she will continue to cast a shadow over the catwalk."

      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

      "According to new analysis by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) - which looked at pupil performance after the Covid-19 pandemic - children from the lowest income families are now up to 19 months behind peers by the time they are 16 years old.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.",
      "The latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.",
      "It comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.",
      "However, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.",
      "Natalie Perera, from the EPI, said it is the first time \"a very clear link\" has been made between how much children from the lowest income families attend school, and how far behind other pupils they have fallen.",
      "Her team looked specifically at children who have received free school meals in the past six years, which means the family income is less than \u00a37,400 a year after tax and not including benefits.",
      "Ms Perera said more research was needed to understand why these children struggled to be in school, with possible factors including poor housing and mental health.",
      "It is five years since the UK went into lockdown, when schools closed to most children.",
      "Playgroups and nurseries also shut, with parents of babies and toddlers isolated from their extended family. There were other changes too, as health visitors were re-deployed or in contact with parents only online.",
      "Panorama has heard from families and teachers about the impact on these children, who are just starting or are still in primary school.",
      "Schools say some have delayed speech and understanding of words, or have slower social or emotional development, or they lack basic skills normally picked up through play.",

      "What do you think it could be?",
      "The answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.",

      "It's just a crisis we don't talk about.",
      "So I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.",
      "I started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.",
      "It's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.",
      "You can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.",
      "The one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.",
      "And the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.",
      "\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.",
      "Only the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response.",
      "LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer?",
      "LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer?",
      "But why is sound changing my body?",
      "\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.",
      "This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.",
      "\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.",
      "All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.",
      "\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.",
      "\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.",
      "Noise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.",
      "I meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.",
      "There's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.",
      "From the balcony you can see the city's famous cathedral, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.",
      "\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.",
      "She gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.",
      "Her home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".",
      "She has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.",
      "In Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.",
      "Across Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.",
      "I meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.",
      "We can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.",
      "The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.",
      "\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.",
      "And that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.",
      "Although it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.",
      "Dr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.",
      "\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.",
      "A loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.",
      "The sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.",
      "Dr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.",
      "But there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old cross roads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.",
      "Remember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.",
      "\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says.",
      "The initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.",
      "Dr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.",
      "But in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.",
      "Urbanisation",
      "The dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.",
      "Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.",
      "Artist Momina Raman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.",
      "For about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.",
      "He took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.",
      "\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"",
      "But here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.",
      "There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.",
      "She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"",
      "The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.",
      "What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".",

    "story": [
      "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.",
      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

    "summary": "As part of Your Voice, Your BBC, we answer questions from you on government plans to scrap NHS England.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",

      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",

      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",

      "Ministers are looking at tightening the eligibility criteria for a key disability benefit - the Personal Independence Payments (PIP). But the BBC understands there will not be an inflation freeze on the payments, an idea initially proposed.",
      "There is significant unease among Labour MPs about the welfare cuts, spreading far beyond Sir Keir's usual internal opponents. It is unclear as yet, though, whether that will harden into public opposition.",
      "More than 3.6 million people currently claim PIP - which is designed to help compensate those with disabilities and long-term health conditions for higher living costs such as the purchase of a wheelchair or having to take more taxis to get around.",
      "It had been initially reported that the government would consider not increasing PIP payments in life with inflation for a year. But that idea could be withdrawn after many usually loyal Labour MPs voiced strong opposition.",

      "\"Some people have very complex disabilities. Part of the social contract is they are supported\", they said.",

      "Over recent weeks, however, it has become clear that the OBR has told Rachel Reeves that the \u00a39.9 billion \"headroom\" she had at the time of her October Budget has since been wiped out by the rising cost of government borrowing \u2013 requiring savings. This was the buffer Reeves had against meeting her own borrowing rules.",
      "There are some Labour MPs, including ministers, who believe that instead of responding by pursuing severe spending cuts, Reeves and Sir Keir should consider changing those rules so that the government can borrow more money, or increasing tax.",
      "Reeves' allies, though, argue that this would spook the financial markets and result in the cost of borrowing going up even further, exacerbating the issues she is now trying to solve. On tax, the chancellor is constrained by commitments Labour made during the general election not to increase income tax or VAT.",

      "The health secretary said he wanted to \"follow the evidence and I agree with that point about overdiagnosis\".",
      "\"Here's the other thing, mental wellbeing, illness, it's a spectrum and I think definitely there's an overdiagnosis but there's too many people being written off,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\" as US President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium take effect.",
      "The UK exports hundreds of millions of pounds worth of steel to the US every year, which will be subject to the 25% levy.",
      "The EU, facing the same tariffs, said on Wednesday it would impose counter-tariffs on \u20ac26bn (\u00a322bn) of US goods, and Canada also responded with countermeasures, in an escalation of the wider trade war.",
      "Sir Keir said the UK was taking a \"pragmatic\" approach and was pushing for a trade deal, but opposition politicians called for a more \"robust\" response.",
      "When Sir Keir visited the White House last month, trade was high on the agenda, with the PM seeking a trade deal and exemptions to Trump's tariffs.",
      "Asked at the time if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "It is understood tariffs were also discussed during a phone call between Sir Keir and Trump on Monday.",
      "However, as the latest tariffs came into effect, there were no exemptions for any country.",
      "European Union (EU) President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's retaliatory tariffs were \"strong but proportionate\" and that the EU remains \"open to negotiations\".",
      "The EU tariffs will be imposed on \"products ranging from boats to bourbon to motorbikes,\" the EU said. They will be partially introduced on 1 April and fully in place on 13 April.",

      "Canada will impose C$29.8bn (\u00a316bn) of retaliatory tariffs on US exports from Thursday, Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said.",
      "Alongside steel and aluminium, the levies will apply to computers, sports equipment, and cast iron products, LeBlanc said.",
      "Later on Wednesday Trump said he would \"of course\" respond to the retaliation, repeating his warning that he planned to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries around the world.",
      "\"Whatever it is, doesn't matter what it is, if they charge us, if they charge us 25% or 20% or 10% or 2% or 200% then that's what we're charging them,\" he said.",
      "The US President said he was \"not happy\" with EU trade policies, citing concerns about legal penalties it has imposed on Apple and rules he claimed put US farm products and cars at a disadvantage.",
      "\"They're doing what they should be doing perhaps for the European Union but it does create ill will,\" he said.",
      "Repeating his threat to hit European cars with tariffs, he added later: \"We're going to win that financial battle.\"",

      "Some steel company contracts have already been cancelled or been put on hold, he said.",
      "Unite general secretary Sharon Graham called on the government to \"act decisively\" to protect the steel industry.",
      "The Community union called for a UK tax on carbon-intensive steel, produced with a bigger environmental footprint, which would include exports from China and India.",
      "The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, around \u00a3700m in total. However the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, worth much more, about \u00a32.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year.",
      "Sir Keir's comments at Prime Minister's Questions came in response to Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who called for the UK to be \"more robust\" with the US president \"like the Europeans and like the Canadians\".",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said Labour \"can't even get themselves in the room\" to negotiate with the US\".",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We are... negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed, but we will keep all options on the table.\"",
      "There have been frequent talks between ministers and US officials since the measures were first proposed in February, the BBC understands.",

      "US share prices sank on Monday and Tuesday as traders and analysts expressed recession fears.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:05:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Labour may have ditched its factional in-fighting - but deep welfare cuts could reignite tensions.",
    "story": [
      "The prime minister has just had another moment at the lectern, urging Europe to stand up for Ukraine. He's an increasingly confident leader, but in the coming days No 10 faces what could be a defining fight at home.",
      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

    "summary": "The government is to set out details of how it will save billions of pounds from the working welfare bill.",
    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.",
      "That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.",
      "And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.",
      "There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:",
      "Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "Cutting the level of benefit payments",
      "Tightening the eligibility for benefits",
      "Attempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.",
      "\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "Freezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.",
      "But you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.",
      "Also, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.",
      "Under previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.",
      "And from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "Rather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.",
      "For instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.",
      "\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.",
      "Encourage work",
      "Another way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.",
      "The OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).",
      "Another potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.",
      "Some advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to slash the costs of regulation with an \"active government\".",
      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",

      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",

      "Perhaps the person the prime minister has to thank the most for his whopping majority has been making the case he is now making for a while.",
      "Their language and emphases may be different, but the diagnosis is the same.",
      "Starmer and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "Starmer pledges to tackle 'flabby' state",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 12:26:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give more detail about the government's plans for the economy.",
    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are expected on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The government is also seeking to reorganise the civil service to reduce bureaucracy. It has already announced that NHS England will be scrapped, and other quangos and regulators are also expected to be axed.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares",
      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:13:02 GMT",
    "summary": "How much will the UK be hit by US tariffs and what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "That Nicola Sturgeon should choose to stand down from Holyrood at the next election was entirely expected.",
      "Even if the former first minister liked to try and keep the media guessing.",
      "When asked a couple of weeks ago if she was going to quit as an MSP she told journalists \"you'll have to wait and see\".",
      "In reality, the chances of her staying on to sit on the backbenches and make worthy interventions were always slim.",
      "Having personally fronted the Scottish government's response to a global pandemic, for instance, she would have been bored to tears.",

      "While her decision to stand down as an MSP was obvious and much anticipated, it still has the capacity to startle.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon remains the biggest name in Scottish politics.",
      "She was a player in UK politics in a way that neither of her successors could expect to be.",
      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",
      "Subsequent talk of using a UK general election as a substitute referendum lacked credibility.",
      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",
      "Then there was her attempt to realign Scottish politics by forming a power-sharing partnership with the Greens to achieve political stability for the Scottish government.",
      "That controversial arrangement was discontinued by her immediate successor Humza Yousaf.",
      "What will be her legacy?",
      "She was the first minister who expanded early learning and childcare and used new welfare powers to introduce a weekly child payment unique to Scotland - policies she would regard as significant achievements.",
      "While opposition parties say they would maintain these benefits, financial watchdogs warn that the extent of health and social welfare spending in Scotland is unsustainable.",
      "All of this is part of the Sturgeon legacy to be debated as she counts down to her departure from the Scottish Parliament in just over a year.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon famously made decisions in a very tight circle and according to one adviser her decision-making group became ever smaller.",
      "By the end, this source said she was operating in \"a circle of one\".",
      "It was ultimately her decision to leave high office just as it is now hers to leave frontline politics altogether.",
      "As she has noted herself in the past, Nicola Sturgeon is a public figure loved and loathed in almost equal measure but there can be few who would doubt that politics will be a duller place without her presence."

      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 01:26:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

      "Responding to the first ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Judge Alsup of singlehandedly \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch\".",

      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way.",

      "Ellie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".",
      "\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",

      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",

      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",

      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",

      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",

      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "Butch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX.",
      "The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system.",
      "Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months.",
      "Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber.",

      "The assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch.",
      "\"We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,\" he said.",
      "That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS.",
      "\"Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,\" she said.",
      "\"Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe.",

    "story": [
      "Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring \"we've got your back\".",
      "Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high profile visit to a naval warship.",
      "When Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney goes on his first foreign visit to Paris and London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - he's hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.",
      "Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.",
      "\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians \u2013 Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United State's \"51st state\".",
      "The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip, which starts on Monday, underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security \u2013 a natural fit for the economist who headed the Central Bank in Canada and Britain. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".",
      "His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.",
      "Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".",
      "So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour \u2013 Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".",
      "Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.",
      "And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.",
      "His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.",
      "And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.",
      "But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.",
      "His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.",
      "Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.",
      "\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.",
      "Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.",
      "Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.",

      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.",
      "A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.",
      "\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"",
      "But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.",
      "And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.",
      "On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.",
      "In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.",
      "Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.",

      "How did the gang start?",
      "Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a \"transnational criminal organisation\", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.",
      "Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade.",
      "He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. Upon his return, he transformed the prison into a leisure complex.",
      "And he expanded the gang's influence far beyond the jail's gates, seizing control of gold mines in Bolivar state, drug corridors on the Caribbean coast, and clandestine border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, according to the US state department.",
      "The gang's name translates as \"Train of Aragua\", and it may have come from a railroad workers' union.",
      "Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.",
      "Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.",
      "How big is the gang?",
      "By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.",
      "Ronna R\u00edsquez, a journalist who has written the definitive book on the group, estimated last year that the organisation has 5,000 members and annual profits of between $10m and $15m.",
      "Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.",
      "A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a \"brutal organisation\" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.",
      "While it is smaller or less wealthy than other criminal groups in Latin America, Tren de Aragua is often compared to the ultra-violent MS-13 gang from El Salvador.",
      "Tren de Aragua members have been accused of dressing up as Chilean police officers and then kidnapping Venezuelan opposition military officer Ronald Ojeda, whose body was found buried in Santiago, Chile, in March 2024.",
      "The US Treasury, under then-President Joe Biden, sanctioned Tren de Aragua last summer, saying that the gang was involved in sex-trafficking across the US border.",
      "Is there a threat to the US?",
      "On Saturday Trump invoked the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act as he accused Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".",
      "He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January Trump also has declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.",

      "This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing.",
      "\"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\".",
      "The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.",
      "Relations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her.",
      "Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move.",
      "\"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London.",
      "There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade.",
      "Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months.",
      "And then there is a growing military relationship.",

      "\"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time.",
      "The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases.",
      "So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",

      "During the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad.",
      "Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so.",
      "\"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\"",
      "Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\".",
      "However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence.",
      "\"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.",
      "While history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan.",
      "\"Pakistan's more than 250 million population is a solid market for Bangladesh in the medium to long term,\" says Sabrin Beg, an associate professor of economics at the University of Delaware.",
      "Currently, there are constraints including high tariffs on both sides and businesses and exporters face visa and travel obstacles, she points out. However, Ms Beg says \"improved bilateral political and trade relations will ease these constraints\".",
      "Some of these issues may be discussed during Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Dhaka in April. By the end of the year Bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities.",
      "But, whatever happens, the stakes are high for Delhi, which strongly feels that a stable and friendly Bangladesh is necessary to maintain peace and stability in its north-eastern states.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.",
      "This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.",
      "\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.",
      "All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.",
      "\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.",
      "\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.",

      "\"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,\" says Karen. \"Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.\"",
      "But years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.",
      "\"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,\" she says. \"We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can\u2019t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.\"",
      "When Karen\u2019s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.",
      "Karen helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.",
      "\"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,\" she says. \"These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.\"",
      "Teresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.",
      "Years later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up.",
      "That does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected.",
      "\"ALS took my sister at 50,\" Teresa says. \"I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she\u2019d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.\"",
      "Like Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.",
      "Expanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.",
      "The BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.",
      "\"My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She\u2019d be the first to picket,\" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.",
      "The trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.",
      "Dr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a \"statistical thing\", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.",
      "Now, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.",
      "\"I tell them that there\u2019s a potential that there\u2019s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.\"",
      "He hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.",
      "Other experts take a different view of the risks. \"There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades\", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University.",
      "\"But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.\"",
      "Prof Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards.",
      "For many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.",
      "\"It\u2019s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,\u201d says Kim Visintine. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"",
      "Correction 16 March: This article originally reported that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covered parts of New Mexico. It has been amended to show that benefits were paid under the act to people in Arizona, Nevada and Utah, but not in New Mexico."

      "Retired Navy Admiral William McRaven was the architect of the mission that tracked down Osama bin Laden. He's also a bestselling author. Now, McRaven and his daughter, Kelly, have thoughts about children and storytelling:",
      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",
      "I waited every night for a new adventure, not knowing that I was also learning a lesson.",
      "When I became a father, I wanted to pass that tradition on to my own children, including my daughter, Kelly.",
      "KELLY: When my brothers and I were children, my dad loved telling us stories. Every night, I would eagerly await his arrival, excited to hear a new tale.",
      "What I didn't realize at the time was that these stories were more than just entertaining; they were carefully crafted to teach us valuable morals and lessons that he hoped we would carry into our daily lives. Much as his own father had taught him these lessons, he was now passing them along.",
      "WILLIAM: Now, as parents, we want our children to grow up to be thoughtful, kind, generous, honest, hard-working, and courageous. We hope that they will learn these lessons by watching us, provided we do the right things in life.",
      "However, the stories we tell them at a young age play a crucial role in their development. If we tell them stories of boys and girls like them, who overcome challenges by being honest, noble and courageous, they are more likely to grow up admiring and demonstrating these qualities.",
      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",
      "WILLIAM: Translating my adult books into children's books was a natural evolution, and an important mission for me. My adult books all try to convey the values that I believe make us better citizens, leaders, and human beings.",
      "I try to capture those same themes in my children's books. Whether it's the wisdom of Navy SEAL training, or the power of a simple act like making your bed, the stories we tell our children and grandchildren can shape their lives for the better.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Mar 2025 11:10:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",

He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

    "story": [
      "In recent years, research has suggested a connection between oral bacteria and Alzheimer's disease, raising concerns for those with poor dental health.",
      "With nearly 700 species of bacteria inhabiting the human mouth, experts say maintaining good oral hygiene could benefit both heart and brain health.",
      "There is growing evidence suggesting good oral health could help prevent Alzheimer's disease. One study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease\u00a0found that people who flossed regularly had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's than those who did not.",
      "However, researchers caution there is still limited research. The observational studies do not prove that flossing directly prevents Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"When you think about it, what is poor gum health, poor dental health? It's really a bacterial infection,\" explained Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor. \"When you have chronic infection, chronic inflammation, we know that chronic inflammation increases your risk for heart disease, for cerebrovascular disease, brain disease. It's really important to control these things.\"",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults 30 years or older have some form of periodontal disease.",
      "In addition to causing inflammation, the bacteria associated with gum disease produce enzymes that can be directly toxic to nerves, Gounder said. They also weaken the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxins and other bacteria to enter the brain.",
      "Research shows that these oral bacteria can increase amyloid in the brain \u2014 a protein plaque connected with Alzheimer's disease.",
      "The mouth-to-brain pathway occurs when bacteria from dental problems enter the bloodstream.",
      "\"When you have gum disease and dental problems, the bacteria in your mouth are getting into the blood, and from the blood, they can travel anywhere, including the heart and the brain,\" Gounder said.",
      "This bacterial spread isn't a new concern. Before antibiotics became available in the 1800s, dental infections commonly led to heart valve infections and heart failure as bacteria spread through the bloodstream.",
      "While water picks and mouthwash offer some benefits, Gounder emphasized they aren't sufficient replacements for flossing.",
      "\"Water picks are better than nothing, but mouthwash is not a substitute ... There is really no replacement for something like flossing,\" she said.",
      "The National Institutes of Health identifies several signs of gum disease, including red, swollen, or bleeding gums; pain while chewing; persistent bad breath; and loose or sensitive teeth.",
      "For prevention, the NIH recommends brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, visiting the dentist twice per year, and avoiding smoking.",
      "The recommendation is to floss once daily, preferably before bed. However, people with gingivitis, receding gums, diabetes or heart disease may benefit from flossing at least twice daily.",

    "story": [
      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",
      "\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.",

      "A total of 1,274 cases were reported in 2019, according to the CDC, the most reported in the U.S. in decades. Health officials were alarmed at the time about large and ongoing outbreaks, driven mostly by spread in undervaccinated communities in New York.",
      "Before this year, the last U.S. measles death in the CDC's death certificate records was also in 2019. This past February, a child who was hospitalized with measles died in West Texas. This month, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico tested positive for measles after their death, although health officials said the official cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "The U.S. is not the only country seeing an increase in measles cases. A separate record outbreak in Canada has driven up cases across the Americas, prompting the World Health Organization to warn earlier this month that the region's \"elimination status\" was at risk.",

      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",

There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",

      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",

      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people.

      "Guinness, the Irish beer that has been around since before the American Revolution, is celebrating a renaissance with rapidly rising popularity in the United States.",
      "\"People are finding this beer for the first time, or, in some cases, rediscovering it,\" said Ryan Wagner, Guinness National Ambassador. \"You're not just finding it in Irish pubs. Now it's in sports bars, at the beach, in coolers being taken to tailgates.\"",
      "Part of this resurgence is attributed to social media, where the viral \"Splitting the G\" challenge has celebrities like Ed Sheeran and Niall Horan attempting to take one or two gulps and land the beer line precisely in the gap of the letter \"G\" in the logo.",
      "For newcomers concerned about Guinness' dark appearance, Wagner offered reassurance.",
      "\"The first thing we would tell someone is don't let the color scare you away. It's light in body. It's a little roasty, a little toasty, incredibly drinkable, and something that's built around occasions, bringing people together.\"",
      "The legacy of Guinness",
      "The brewing legacy dates back to 1759 in Dublin. Today, 3.5 million pints are produced daily and shipped worldwide. Devoted fans insist the beer requires a specific \"perfect pour\" technique \u2014 a two-part process that affects both taste and texture.",

    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",

      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",

      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:56:29 -0400",
    "summary": "The USDA said it is promoting wiser government spending, but schools say it will make it tougher to serve healthy meals.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "\"USDA can confirm it has provided notice to States, Territories and Tribes that the FY 2025 funding previously announced for the pandemic-era Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and pandemic-era Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program is no longer available and those agreements will be terminated following 60-day notification,\" a spokesperson with the\u00a0agency said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",
      "One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business. Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer.",
      "\"We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester Food Hub,\" Carlson said. \"They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\"Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\" Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\"",
      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \"things are going to be different in two months\" with the issues the agency is experiencing.",
      "Cohen responded by saying he \"cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse.\"",
      "\"But there are a lot of reasons to believe ... we have been through the brunt of it, at least for a while,\" he said.",
      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",

Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \"optimistic\" about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% on an annual basis, slightly lower than economists had forecast but continuing to signal that price hikes remain elevated despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",

      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

      "President Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising they would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and even a global trade war.",

      "\"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros ($28 billion),\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. \"We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",

      "Canada also plans to announce\u00a0nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum levies, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Lutnick defends Trump economic policies",

The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",
      "The ongoing rise in food prices is posing a challenge to some U.S. households, particularly among lower-income consumers who spend a greater share of their income on groceries than higher-earning Americans, according to a new Bank of America Institute analysis of consumer spending.",
      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "But while egg prices could see some relief in Wednesday's inflation report, food prices are still on the rise, economists say. On a month-over-month basis, food costs likely rose 0.3%, Vanguard said on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans themselves are bracing for higher grocery costs, according to the March 10 release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",
      "\"Households expressed more pessimism about their year-ahead financial situations in February, while unemployment, delinquency and credit access expectations deteriorated notably,\" the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. \"Meanwhile, spending growth expectations rose significantly.\"",

    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

      "The judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"",
      "Presidents are given the extraordinary power by the\u00a0227-year-old law\u00a0to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argued that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"",
      "Then, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation, following Boasberg's decision. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "Boasberg also appeared to verbally indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S., although that directive was not part of his written order.",
      "Social media posts from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele indicated at least one flight carrying deported individuals had arrived in his country after the order. In one post, Bukele commented on a news story about the ruling by writing, \"Oopsie\u2026 Too late.\" That post was shared by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung.",
      "The Trump administration insists it did not defy the court order. The Justice Department, which has appealed the ruling, said in a court filing that several people \"had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court's second order.\" It noted that the five men covered by the first temporary restraining order had not been deported.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday said, \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" also saying the order came after the deportation\u00a0flight to El Salvador had left the country.",
      "The lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"",
      "\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "As such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement responding to the ruling that, \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "The lawsuit further argued that the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country \u2014 Venezuela \u2014 with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too.",
      "Rubio said after the arrest that the administration will be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "On Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"",
      "The secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"",
      "\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",
      "A top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Rubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"",
      "More broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.",
      "Asked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"",
      "\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels are targeting the group's ability to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. military, and are \"doing the world a favor.\"",
      "\"We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump announced the strikes Saturday, saying the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis cease shipping attacks. U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a social media post Saturday, and it's prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on reaction from the Houthis and Iran, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "U.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.",
      "Saturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"",
      "\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"",
      "The secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.",
      "\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"",
      "Asked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"",
      "Rubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"",
      "\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the swift detention and deportation of all Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang, treating them like wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "In his proclamation, the president argued the Venezuelan gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for invoking the 227-year-old war authority.",
      "The president directed the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every\" Venezuelan migrant, 14 or older, who is deemed to be part of Tren de Aragua and who lacks U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.",
      "Those subject to the law would be eligible to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, which include opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they would be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws.",
      "But Mr. Trump's directive was dealt an almost immediate blow on Saturday, after a federal judge agreed to block the government from deporting anyone in U.S. immigration custody subject to the president's Alien Enemies Act proclamation.",
      "At the request of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, James Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked those deportations through a 14-day temporary restraining order. Deportation flights in the air with deportees subject to Mr. Trump's decree should return to the U.S., Boasberg indicated during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Boasberg issued another order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelan migrants in immigration detention who the ACLU said were at risk of being expelled under Mr. Trump's directive.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",

      "As Mr. Trump's proclamation was litigated in Washington, the U.S. deported more than 260 migrants to El Salvador over the weekend, including Venezuelans with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video showing some of the deportees being escorted by armed soldiers and police, having their heads shaved and marched into a prison.",
      "A senior administration official said 137 of the 261 deportees sent to El Salvador were alleged Venezuelan gang members expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 Venezuelans were deported under regular immigration law, the official said. The group, the official added, also included 21 Salvadorans accused of MS13 gang membership and two \"special cases\" that Bukele described as gang leaders wanted by El Salvador's government.",
      "In a filing on Sunday, the Justice Department said the alleged Venezuelan gang members \"had already been removed from United States territory\" under the Alien Enemies Act before the court order barring the expulsions.",
      "The White House denied it had defied the judge's order. \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.\"",
      "Leavitt added, \"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history. The law it cites, enacted 22 years after the Declaration of Independence, references invasions and incursions staged by \"any foreign nation or government.\"",
      "The centuries-old statue has been invoked only a few times in American history, including during World War I and World War II, when U.S. officials cited it to surveil and detain foreigners from Italy, Germany and Japan.",
      "But never before has the Aliens Enemies Act been invoked to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war or with the premise that a non-state actor is staging an invasion or incursion of the U.S.",

      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",

      "And, finally, Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore weighs in on the impact of cuts to the federal payroll, and Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell on the ripple effects of Trump's trade war with some of America's closest partners.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we come on the air, U.S. forces are in the midst of President Trump's most significant military campaign thus far in his second term.",
      "Let's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida.",
      "Mr. Secretary, for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last and will it involve ground forces?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane. And in the last year- and-a-half, last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States, attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times. And 145 times, they have attacked commercial shipping.",
      "So we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot.",
      "And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those strikes were retaliation strikes. So they launch one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one-off.",
      "This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping. And it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way. It's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here. And it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before. The Biden administration didn't do that.",
      "All the Biden administration would do is, they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it could\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, this will continue until that's finished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I have heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now.",
      "I can tell you that, as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us. And I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing. And that will continue.",
      "Look, it's \u2013 bottom line, easy way to understand it, OK, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They have attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They have attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis, as you know.",
      "Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations.",
      "Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it, 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about.",
      "What we can't ignore and the reason why the president mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They have provided them intelligence. They have provided them guidance. They have provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, OK, the Houthis, would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran.",
      "And so this was a message to Iran. Don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships, in attacking global shipping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to.",
      "But I want to ask you about tariffs, because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back and forth the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini-trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs, on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them.",
      "So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, OK? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War.",
      "But now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low-wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us?",
      "So what the president is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability. And the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States.",
      "The second is global. And that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global \u2013 it's not against Canada. It's not against Mexico. It's not against the E.U. It's everybody.",
      "And then, from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness. But, right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements potentially with countries so that our trade is fair.",
      "What's not going to continue is \u2013 of course, these countries are upset.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral not free trade \u2013 not North American free trade deals?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, it's not leverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Renegotiation?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there we can work on deals and so forth because they will have products we don't make. We have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best.",
      "It has to be free, but it has to be fair in that country. And, right now, it's only free on one side and it's not fair for the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, sir\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's an unsustainable position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pullbacks are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week.",
      "So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seemed to negotiate \u2013 you say this was national security-minded.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But then we also see comments by the president of like 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States. That seems more emotional.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that means \u2013 that's called retaliation. That's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on \u2013 they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine.",
      "Then we will have to find something to \u2013 I mean, you tell me. I mean, Canada's going after whiskey and orange juice. And, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference?",
      "The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them. They like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo. And then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides.",
      "But what we have now cannot continue. We have deindustrialized this country, deindustrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a Rust Belt. That's why we have suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability to other places.",
      "That cannot and will not continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know \u2013 President Trump. This is no mystery. He's been talking about this since the 1980s, actually, even before he was a political figure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia.",
      "You said Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a cease-fire or whether Putin is using a delay tactic. You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think that was a promising meeting. As I have said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully, we will have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, The exchange was promising.",
      "I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front with a lot of complexity to it. So, no one's claiming that it's easy.",
      "But I want everyone to understand here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop, so that we can move to plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not \u2013 maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and that respects everybody's needs and so forth.",
      "No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end to a war as long as they're shooting at each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so the president wants a cease-fire, and that's what we're working on.",
      "Assuming we can get that done \u2013 and that won't be easy in and of itself \u2013 we move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue.",
      "The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We will talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff.",
      "I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board writes: \"The administration needs to be careful it's targeting real promoters of terrorism, not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\"",
      "Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism specifically to Hamas from this Columbia student? Or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, not just the student. We're going to do more. In fact, we \u2013 every day now, we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well.",
      "And here's why. It's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist or what have you. And, in it, you have to make certain assertions. And if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America.",
      "It's that simple. So you lied. You came \u2013 if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straightforward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any \u2013 but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. Yes, they take over \u2013 I mean, do you not \u2013 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges. Well, then you should know that this is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson, was the negotiator on \u2013 negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime, in and of itself, that they're involved and being a negotiator, the spokesperson, this, that, the other.",
      "We don't want \u2013 we don't need these people in our country. We never should have allowed him in, in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library \u2013 the buildings being vandalized, we never would have let him in.",
      "We never would have let him in to begin with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave. And so are others. And we're going to keep doing it.",
      "We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. they had no problem, OK, pressuring social media to censor American political speech.",
      "So I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this. If you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. And now that we know it, you're going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas revoked or are other points of view as well?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor \u2013 look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "They're terrorists too. I \u2013 we \u2013 the president designated them\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well.",
      "You \u2013 we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people \u2013 we don't want people in our country that are going to be\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know what we have gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Secretary Rubio, I'd like to have you back, talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who joins us this morning from Miami Beach.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a cease-fire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin.",
      "I wonder what your answer to the question is in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a cease-fire.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret.",
      "And I agree with the secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was \u2013 it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics. And I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration and where we are today.",
      "We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect Presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision-making call, or is this just next steps?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would assume that they have a \u2013 they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They have talked already after the first visit that I had with President Putin.",
      "And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision-maker, our decision-maker, and President Putin for the country of Russia is their decision-maker.",
      "I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's \u2013 that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a \u2013 an inclination on \u2013 on the part of both countries, and, by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long-term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's president publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting.",
      "We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 look, I don't \u2013 I don't know what President Macron said.",
      "I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have necessarily firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said.",
      "I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to \u2013 to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000-kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing \u2013 shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000-mile border.",
      "That's a very, very complicated cease-fire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I \u2013 I regard as promising.",
      "I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near-term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, beyond the cease-fire, a peace agreement? you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 what I \u2013 what I'm saying, the technical \u2013 what I'm saying is that a cease-fire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border. That's \u2013 that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions.",
      "We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to \u2013 to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement.",
      "There's \u2013 there's just \u2013 there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a cease-fire here. And I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined space as compared to the \u2013 the battle \u2013 where the battle is being fought in Ukraine-Russia.",
      "So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza.",
      "I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the two million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt. You've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans and, by the way, for the people of Israel.",
      "So we're exploring all of those things. But, right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab summit, where we spent 7.5 hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging.",
      "Now, to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen \u2013 that's a red line for the Israelis \u2013 and maybe could have led to a long-term peace resolution here.",
      "And yet Hamas \u2013 Hamas came up with their own construct\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: \u2026 essentially disavowed what we discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And, to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And I \u2013 I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Ambassador Witkoff, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back with more Face the Nation.",

      "Welcome back.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir. And I - I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these - in this past week. Certainly a lot of action.",
      "I looked at the last time we spoke. You were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said, there's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't mind negotiating, as long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So, I think there is a one in trillion chance the ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region.",
      "Yes, I think he - I think he's a fanatical, religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him. And if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60 percent. He has enough to make six bombs at 60 percent. So, turn that all over to the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business and we'll help you with your nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long - that's a long to-do list. And so far no - no indication that he's taking the offer.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Not really. He's - if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Ambassador Witkoff.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know yet. But I do know you play President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So, if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two, ceasefire and peace deal.",
      "What I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine or not. If you're not, go back to maximum pressure.",
      "I have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy. And I'm willing to move forward if I have to. But we're talking about a ceasefire and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But, to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting but 30 years of action. And I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gets from the discussions that Witkoff had. Who, I like Steve, and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing.",
      "I think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the - to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large.",
      "I hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: To engage in a ceasefire and to find a win/win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the U.S. decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I don't know what value these - these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the voice of America really is, Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War. People told us that. So, that's something to consider, is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you had been an advocate for soft power.",
      "I want to ask you about what's happening here at home.",
      "There were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The president suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington and Burling as well because they were involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support this?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think all of these things - I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax - a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6th was politically motivated. And people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict - you know, when Biden took - took -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the U.S. legal system, Senator, because",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president's trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, private business aided government power in a - in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life.",
      "You know, on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family. That they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him politically and personally. I believe that. And if these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame. That's what I believe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are lawyers working on cases that - you're making it sound like the work they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy and they should be punished for it.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think - I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes.",
      "You know, I - we can have a debate about, you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I genuinely don't like that. But these - but these law firms -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And Jack Smith using the power of government, incorporating these law firms, in my - in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So, it was politically motivated. And everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I know, since you're on the Judiciary Committee, and -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer is not going to change -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And have that oversight. It's important to get your point of view, but I've got to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.",
      "Good to have you here and a happy early St. Patrick's Day.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Top of the morning to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to talk about the impact of these tariffs and potential tariffs because you're from the manufacturing hub of Michigan.",
      "We were looking at the data. Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says this is \u2013 this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. And if you'll recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2016, and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in. I worked with him. We renegotiated it. We have the USMCA.",
      "The way that the tariffs are being done now is - it's made a ping-pong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at. We need to using them against China. But I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying. There's no way that in a month's time, when they have such an integrated inventory and production plan - production plants where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen.",
      "So, I want to work with this administration. I think the 25 percent tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. Autos are a ping-pong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We needed industrial policy. Tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a way that lets everybody plan for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the big three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2nd push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion.",
      "Do you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home, like President Trump is asking of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, if everything were go right, which, like in this world does anything ever go right, it's going to take two to three years. Our - our suppliers, also, there are many - and, by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Next -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You support this idea. Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral, not North America as a globe -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Totally. I totally - Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that.",
      "But right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, two - 60 percent of aluminum in this country - that's being used is be - coming in from Canada. You take a 25 percent tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is - is very small. It's not a big - the companies just can't eat that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But we've got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't - I - I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able - they brought 2.5 million vehicles in to - Korea, with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5, not treating everybody equally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: S&P global says there's potential for North American auto production to drop by 20,000 units a day starting this week. That's because of the tariffs. So, it's - it's having a -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: All companies need certainty. Automobiles need certainly. They need to not be a ping-pong ball.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking to the commerce secretary or the trade representative? Is there any conversation?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I have not talked to the commerce secretary. I've talked to Bob Lighthizer, who I worked very closely with in -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The former advisor.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: The former trade advisor. And I worked very closely with President Trump in - in - I totally -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I said he would win. Democrats did a lousy job on trade and that - MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of Democrats and their performance, I want to ask you, what happened this past week. We came near a shutdown. Ultimately, Democrats, in the Senate, did vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal.",
      "Senator Murphy of Connecticut was on another network this morning, and he said, \"it would have been a risk to shut down the government, but it was probably worth taking.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: You know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Well, in the House, we were almost united, except one, and there were very strong feelings in the House about what people thought that the Senate should do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Senate - the Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, would say, you were able to do that because there was wiggle room on votes. The Republicans voted as a bloc.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But I - I think he sent out mixed signals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Schumer did?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: I think - Senator Schumer sent out mixed signals. And I talked to a lot of laborers last week. AFGE, who's employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because concerned about their employees. Who I'm meeting with daily when I'm out there. Came out against supporting it because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just the license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with - people are being hurt.",
      "But, Margaret, people are angry. We're got to move on. Reconciliation is coming up. We have got to be united as Democrats in making sure reconciliation and we protect people from having their health care cut, Medicaid cut, Social Security cut, or Medicare cut, in any way, shape, or form?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can Leader Jeffries actually maintain that kind of unity in the House?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: He showed you that he could do it last week. And I can tell you that when you - I don't think anybody has been home. If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean people are shouting? People are angry? People are upset?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: They want to see Democrats fighting back. And they're really scared about what's going to happen to them. Particularly on - seniors and - I was in - went to my asthma doctor, and a woman in a wheelchair with her child started crying with me in the hospital, what are you going to do so my child can still come here?",

      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-MD): Thank you. Great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have, in your state, the Port of Baltimore. One of the country's largest ports. The president has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2nd is poised to enact 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these - of these - of these disastrous and frankly not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology. But this administration is using it like an ideology. And so, while these decisions are being made - made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore. It's also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impact on our farmers over in the eastern shore, on our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this - and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on cost. It's having very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses. It's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitive, as well as our national security. And so, these are the type of things, this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1,300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally, and is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean then you look at the - at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's - it's either ineffective, it is performative, or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all of these executive actions are falling under.",
      "And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the president of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally.",
      "And so, when we talk about the different tools that we have, just in the past week alone, you know, I signed - I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises because, on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department. And while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, D.C., out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a liberal state, and he said he's going to stop it.",
      "I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Here - here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is - is - that they - that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives.",
      "And so - so the thing that we know about this is, this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place - and we've gone - we went through this process not just for these past couple years since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland - where Maryland won this - this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitively, where we showed that we could be at a place that it was the only site ready place to build, build ready site. So, the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the president has just decided to politicize it by talking about, but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you called him? Have you called the White House?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've tried calling the White House before and - and there - there's - there's no response. And - and, frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break. I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it? But you believe it?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Do I believe the announcement?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the president thinks he has the authority to do this. But I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the president does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. And so, I believe the president of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there's a king of king and a lord of lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here. And you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do.",
      "You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but - but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering.",
      "You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continued resolution, where - where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people.",
      "And so I think, when one - when the American people, when they do not have an option or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then, yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. We are doing everything in our power to fight for the people. And I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who offered alternatives, they just weren't listened to. Do you think there's just no leader in the party?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I don't - I don't see a difference. I don't - I don't see a difference.",
      "And, frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interests, I think for the American people they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing. The performative politics, people are done, and they're exhausted by it. They just want to see results. And that's exactly what we're trying to provide in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you.",

You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology, but this administration is using it like an ideology. And so while the decisions are being made- made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore, which is really one of these country- one of the country's largest and most effective ports.

This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this- and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on costs, it's having a very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses, it's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitiveness, as well as our national security, and so these are the type of things- this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about, and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally? And is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean, when you look at the- at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's either ineffective, it is performative or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all these executive actions are falling under. And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the President of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally. And so when we talk about the different tools that we have- just in this past week alone, you know, I signed- I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises. Because on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA. That just this past week, I have focused on things like lowering prescription drugs costs and actually creating partnerships with the private sector to lower prescription drug costs, that we're working on legislation right now to increase housing inventory that can bring housing prices down, and that is all in- that is all contrary to what we're seeing from the federal government. So the legal tool in working with our Attorney General closely to be able to file suit when the federal government oversteps his bounds is one tool, but we are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure that the people of Maryland are protected, and we're making sure we're putting extra resources and money back into their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department, and while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, DC out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a \"liberal state,\" and he said he's going to stop it. I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: \u00a0Here's- here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is- is that they- that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives and so- so the thing that we know about this this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place and we've gone- we went through this process, not just for these past couple years, since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland- where Maryland won this- this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitatively, where we showed that we could be the place that it was the only site-ready place to build, build-ready site. That we're the place that we could actually have national security assets that they could leverage, particularly when you're talking about the future mission of the FBI, which a lot of it is cyber. That we were the only place that had transportation assets that were close and nearby, that the workers could be able to benefit from. And the place that could get it done cheapest to the American taxpayer by talking about putting it anywhere else, you're talking about adding over a billion dollars in costs to the American taxpayer than what we have already gone through this process with the GSA, the General Service Administration for the state of Maryland. So the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the President has just decided to politicize it by talking about- but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Have you called him? Have you called the White House?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: We tried calling the White House before, and there's- there's- there's no response. And frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe it?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: The announcement?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: \u00a0Well, I believe that the President thinks he has the authority to do this, but I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the President does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. It's the GSA that made the decision that the new FBI building should be going to the state of Maryland, after going through a thorough and a very transparent process. And so I believe the President of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there is a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here, and you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do. You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but- but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age? Or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering. You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continuing resolution where- where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland, that we would have not only seen our economy completely downturn into- into a recession, that we would have seen our nation's credit being downgraded, and along those lines, each and every one of us as states, our credit would have been downgraded as well because The United States decided that it's now no longer paying its bills. And we would have seen thousands of federal workers unfairly now being laid off or furloughed. So we know the consequences. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people. And so I think when the American people, when they do not have an option, or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. So we've got to do everything in our power. I know in the state of Maryland, we are mobilizing to make sure we're protecting our federal workers, that we're streamlining them into not just private sector jobs, but also state jobs that are open and available. That we're making sure we're increasing our unemployment insurance, and we are doing things like lowering the price of prescription drugs, and we're doing things like increasing housing inventory, which is going to decrease the housing price. We're doing everything in our power to fight for the people, and I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who awful- offered alternatives. They just weren't listened to. Do you think there is just no leader--",
      "GOV. MOORE: I don't see a difference--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the party?",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0I don't- I don't see a difference. And frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interest, I think for the American people, they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing, the performative politics. People are done, and they are exhausted by it. They just want to see results, and that's exactly what we're trying to provide here in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0Thank you.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Good to have you here, and happy early St. Patrick's Day.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Top of the morning to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to talk about the impact of these tariffs and potential tariffs, because you're from the manufacturing hub of Michigan. We were looking at the data- Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says, this is- this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?",
      "REP. DINGELL: So I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the tool box. And if you recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2-16 and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in, I worked with them, we renegotiated it, we have USMCA. The way that the tariffs are being done now is- it's made a pingpong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at, we need to be using them against China, but I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying with USMCA. There's no way that in a month's time when they have such an integrated inventory and production- production plans, where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen. So I want to work with this administration. I think the 25% tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. The autos are a pingpong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We need an industrial policy, tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a- a way that lets everybody plan for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the Big Three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2 push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion. Do you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home like President Trump is asking of them?",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 So if everything were to go right--which, like, in this world, does anything ever go right?--it's going to take two to three years. Our suppliers, also, there are many- and by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Mexico--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You support this idea of- Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral--",
      "REP. DINGELL: Totally. I- I--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --not North America as a--",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 Totally. Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that. But right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, to- 60% of aluminum in this country that's being used is coming in from Canada. You take a 25% tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is very small. It's- it's not a big- the companies just can't eat that. But we got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't- I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able- they brought 2.5 million vehicles in, Korea with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5. Not treating everybody equally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 S&P Global says there's potential for North American auto production to drop by 20,000 units a day, starting this week. That's because of the tariffs. So it's having--",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 All companies need certainty. Automobiles need certainty. They need to not be a pingpong ball.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Are you talking to the Commerce Secretary or the Trade Representative? Is there any conversation?",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 I have not talked to the Commerce Secretary. I've talked to Bob Lighthizer who I worked very closely with--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The former advisor--",
      "REP. DINGELL: --the former trade advisor. And I worked very closely with President Trump in two- I totally- I said he would win. Democrats did a lousy job on trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Speaking of Democrats and their performance, I want to ask you what happened this past week. We came near a shutdown. Ultimately, Democrats in the Senate did vote with Republicans on this short term funding deal. Senator Murphy of Connecticut was on another network this morning, and he said it would have been a risk to shut down the government, but it was probably worth taking.",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 You know--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree?",
      "REP. DINGELL: Well, in the House, we were almost united, save one, and there were very strong feelings in the House about what people thought that the Senate should do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The Senate Leader Chuck Schumer would say, you were able to do that because there was wiggle room on votes--",
      "REP. DINGELL: But I'm gonna--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the republicans voted as a block.",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 I think he sent out mixed signals. I think if--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Schumer did?",
      "REP. DINGELL: Senator Schumer sent out mixed signals. And I've talked to a lot of labor last week. AFGE, whose employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because- concerned about their employees, so I'm meeting with [them] daily when I'm out there- came out against supporting it, because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just a license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with it, people are being hurt. But Margaret, people are angry. We got to move on. Reconciliation is coming up. We have got to be united as Democrats in making sure reconciliation- and we protect people from having their health care cut, Medicaid cut, Social Security cut, or Medicare cut in any way, shape or form.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Can Leader Jeffries actually maintain that kind of unity in the house?",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 He showed you that he could do it last week. And I can tell you that when- I don't think anybody has been home. If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You mean people are shouting, people are angry, people are upset.",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 They want to see Democrats fighting back, and they're really scared about what's going to happen to them, particularly on seniors. And I was in- went to my asthma doctor, and a woman in a wheelchair with her child started crying with me in the hospital. What are you going to do so my child can still come here?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Congresswoman, thank you. We'll have to leave it there for today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir, and I- I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these- in this past week, certainly a lot of action. I looked through the last time we spoke, you were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said there's \"a one in a trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy.\" Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't mind negotiating long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So I think there is a one in a trillion chance the Ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region. Yeah, I think he- I think he's a fanatical religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him, and if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60%. He has enough to make six bombs at 60% so turn that all over the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business, and we'll help you with the nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long- that's a long to do list. And so far, no- no indication that he's taking the offer--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- Not really- if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment. You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine. Do- you heard the Secretary of State. You heard Ambassador Witkoff. Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't know yet, but I do know you played President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two: ceasefire and peace deal. What I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine, or not? If you're not, go back to maximum pressure. I have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy, and I'm willing to move forward if I have to, but we're talking about ceasefire, and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting, but 30 years of action, and I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you have--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: So if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gives from the discussions that Witkoff have, who- I like Steve and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing. I think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the- to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large. I hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table, to engage in a ceasefire and to find a win, win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the US decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Yeah- I don't know what value these- these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the Voice of America really is. Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War, people told us that. So, that's something to consider. Is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah you had been an advocate for soft power, I want to ask you about what's happening here at home. There were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm, despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The President suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington & Burling as well because they were involved in representing former Special Counsel Jack Smith. Do you support this?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think all of these things- I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax, a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele Dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6 was politically motivated, and people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: You know when Biden took- took- yeah I think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the US legal system, Senator? Because the President is trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Private business aided government power in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life. You know- on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family- that they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him, politically and personally. I believe that. If these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame, that's what I believe--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But these are lawyers working on cases that- you're making it sound like the work that they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy, and they should be punished for it.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, I think- I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes. You know, we can have a debate about- you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I generally don't like that, but these- but these laws firms--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like--",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: --and Jack Smith using the power of government- incorporating these law firms in my- in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort, and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So it was politically motivated, and everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know- since you're on the Judiciary Committee--",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer's not going to change--",

I wonder what your answer to the question is, in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a ceasefire?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret, and I agree with the Secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was- it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics, and I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration, and where we are today. We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision making call, or is this just next steps?",

And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",

      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision maker, our decision maker. And President Putin, for the country of Russia, is their decision maker. I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's- that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a- an inclination on- on the part of both countries, and by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's President publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting. We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I- look, I don't- I don't know what President Macron said. I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have, necessarily, firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said. I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to- to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000 kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing- shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000 mile border. That's a very, very, complicated ceasefire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States, sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I- I regard as promising. I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So beyond the ceasefire, a peace agreement, you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I- what I- what I'm saying, the technical- what I'm saying is that a ceasefire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000 kilometer border. That's- that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions. We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to- to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement, there's- there's just- there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a ceasefire here, and I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined, space, as compared to the- the battle- where the battle is being fought, in Ukraine, Russia. So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza. I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt, you've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things. But right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab Summit, where we spent seven and a half hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging. Now to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here, that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen. That's a red line for the Israelis. And maybe could have led to a long term peace resolution here. And yet Hamas- Hamas came up with their own construct, essentially disavowed what we discussed, and to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending, and I- I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida. Mr. Secretary for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last, and will it involve ground forces?",
      "U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane and in the last year-and-a-half, the last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 naval vessels of the United States. Attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times, and 145 times they've attacked commercial shipping. So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exact- exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot and so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been construct- conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, those strikes were a retaliation strike. So they launched one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one off. This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping, and it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons, able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way, it's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor. We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before, the Biden Administration didn't do that. All the Biden Administration would do is they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: and it could\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013So, this will continue until that's finished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I've heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now. I can tell you that as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue. The- look, it's bottom line, easy way to understand it, okay, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They've attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They've attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis as you know. Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations. Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis, to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it. 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about. What we can't ignore, and the reason why the President mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They provided them intelligence, they provided them guidance, they provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, okay, the Houthis would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran. And so this was a message to Iran, don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships and attacking global shipping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to, but I want to ask you about tariffs because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back-and-forth, the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them. So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, okay? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off gilt- kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War, but now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us? So what the President is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability and the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States. The second is global, and that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global, it's not against Canada, it's not against Mexico, it's not against the EU, it's everybody. And then from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage, potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness, but right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline, and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements, potentially, with countries so that our trade is fair. What's not going to continue is, of course, these countries are upset\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral, not free trade- not North American Free trade deals\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, it's not leverage\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: re- renegotiation\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013 No, no, it's not leverage, it's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there, we can work on deals and- and so forth, because they'll have products we don't make, we have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best. It has to be free, but it has to be fair, and right now it's only free on one side, and it's not fair for the other side\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you know, sir, that\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013It's an unsustainable position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pull backs are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week. So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seem to negotiate- say this was national security minded. But then we also see comments by the President of like, 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States, that seems more emotional.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, that means that's- that's called retaliation that's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on- they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine, then we'll have to find something to- I mean, you tell me? I mean, Canada is going after whiskey and orange juice and you know I mean\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference? The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them, they like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo, and then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides. But what we have now cannot continue. We have de-industrialized this country. De-industrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a rust belt, that's why we've suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability, to other places that cannot and will not continue. I don't- President Trump, this is no mystery, he's been talking about this since the 1980s actually, even before he was a political figure. This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia. You said envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a ceasefire, or whether Putin is using a delay tactic? You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think that was a pro- promising meeting. As I've said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully we'll have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, the exchange was promising. I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex, three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front, with a lot of complexity to it. So no one's claiming that it's easy, but I want everyone to understand, here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop so that we can move to Plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not- maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and it respects everybody's needs and so forth. No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end of a war as long as they're shooting at each other, and so the president wants a ceasefire. That's what we're working on, assuming we can get that done. That won't be easy in and of itself. We move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue. The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, we'll talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff. I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes, \"the administration needs to be careful, it's targeting real promoters of terrorism not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\" Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013specifically to Hamas, from this Columbia student\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, not just the student, we're going to do more. In fact, we- every day now we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well and here's why, it's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest, and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist, or what have you. And in it, you have to make certain assertations and if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. It's that simple. So, you lied. You came- if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straight forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, is there any- but is there any evidence of a\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes. Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, they take over. I mean, do you not- I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely. I'm asking about the specific\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013well then you should know that this is\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013justification for the revocation of his visa\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013was there any evidence the materials support for terrorism?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013was the negotiator- on negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus? That vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in the being the negotiator, the spokesperson, this that the other. We don't want- we don't need these people in our country that we never should have allowed them in in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there, and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library buildings being vandalized. We never would have let him in. We never would have let him in to begin with. And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave, and so are others, and we're going to keep doing it. We're here- and by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013sympathizers, they had no problem, okay, pressuring social media to censor American political speech. So it's, I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this, if you are in this country, to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus. We never would have let you in if we had known that and now that we know it, you're going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas remote- revoked, or other points of view as well?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor- look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members. They're terrorists too. We, the president, designated them, asked me to designate and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well. You're- we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people- we don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple, especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is. I don't know what we've gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country, and if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Rubio, like to have you back. Talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Thank you.",

      "\"I am deeply saddened that for the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" Michael Abramowitz, director of Voice of America, said in a statement provided to CBS News Saturday. \"I learned this morning that virtually the entire staff of Voice of America\u2014more than 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff\u2014has been placed on administrative leave today. So have I.\"",
      "Abramowitz acknowledged that the agency needs \"thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard. But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission. That mission is especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.\"",
      "VOA first began broadcasting in 1942 and reaches an audience of 361 million worldwide in 49 languages and some regions that are \" deeply underrepresented.\" Prior to Saturday's action, it had a total of about 2,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $260 million.",
      "\"The American people deserve to know,\" one VOA journalist who received Saturday's notice told CBS News, adding that this is another example of the U.S. \"losing soft power\" to Russia and China.",

      "CENTCOM reported in a social media post that Abu Khadija was killed in a \"precision airstrike\" Thursday in Iraq's Al Anbar Province in an operation involving Iraqi intelligence and CENTCOM forces. A second ISIS operative was also killed in the strike. Aerial video of the strike was also released.",
      "Following the airstrike, U.S. and Iraqi forces moved in to find both deceased terrorists wearing unexploded suicide vests and armed with multiple weapons, CENTCOM said. Abu Khadijah was identified using DNA testing which had been collected during a previous raid which he had escaped.",

      "The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad's government in Syria.",

      "The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an Islamic State resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria.",
      "While Syria's new rulers \u2014 led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 have pursued Islamic State cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence.",
      "The U.S. and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.",
      "When the agreement was reached to end the coalition's mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of the Islamic State was under control and they no longer needed Washington's help to beat back the remaining cells.",

    "summary": "Scientists are conducting experiments to generate clean energy through fusion, the same sub-atomic reaction that powers our Sun, with the aim of constructing plants that produce more energy than they consume.",
    "story": [
      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed. The breakthrough, in 2022, crucial to ever creating a fusion power plant, made headlines around the world. Humans had unlocked the power of the stars.",

      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",
      "\"This is not a paper exercise for us,\" Mumgaard said. \"We're putting this machine together, we're buying the parts, we're machining the parts, and it's all coming together at the exact time the world really needs something like this. I think that's a really cool story.\"",

    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",

This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

      "Over 800 marine species were newly discovered after two years of collaborative efforts by scientists, governments, museums and others participating in the Ocean Census, a global alliance founded to accelerate the discovery of marine life.",
      "New species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, and shrimp were just some of the findings that were registered in a directory after the collaborative conducted 10 global expeditions and hosted eight Species Discovery Workshops.",
      "\"The past two years have been transformative for the Ocean Census: we've pioneered new methods, forged key partnerships, established a global network of participating scientists, and overcome the hurdles of a truly global mission,\" said Oliver Steeds, director of the Ocean Census,\u00a0in a statement.",
      "While oceans cover most of our planet, not much has been done to protect its biodiversity, manage the conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. United Nations members\u00a0agreed on a unified treaty\u00a0in 2023 to protect biodiversity in the high seas. More than 100 nations, including the United States, have agreed to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.",

      "The alliance was founded by Nippon Foundation and Nekton in April 2023; about 400 institutions participate in its activities, and 93 scientists were funded to participate in expeditions and research projects in an effort to speed up the identification and official registration of a new species, the Ocean Census\u00a0said\u00a0on its website. The process can take up to 13.5 years, some species may go extinct before they are even documented.",
      "Dave Ebert of the Pacific Shark Research Institute said in a video that knowing we have another new species, \"We can develop conservation methods for it - if it needs it.\"",
      "The recent flurry of expeditions launched by the Ocean Census used divers, submersibles and deep-sea robots up to 5000 meters below sea level to discover new species. The species were analyzed and confirmed in dozens of global laboratories.",
      "Some of the species discovered include:",
      "Guitar Shark",
      "Ebert, also known as the \"Lost Shark Guy,\" identified the guitar shark at 200m depths off Mozambique and Tanzania in Africa. This shark has 38 known species across the globe and shares characteristics of both sharks and rays.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",
      "Research at the excavation site will continue, the scientists said.",

    "story": [
      "The Crew 10 Dragon capsule caught up with the International Space Station and moved in for a textbook docking early Sunday, bringing four fresh crew members to the lab and clearing the way for the Starliner astronauts to return to Earth after nearly 300 days in space.",
      "Approaching from behind and below, the Crew Dragon, launched Friday evening from the Kennedy Space Center, passed 1,300 feet directly under the station before looping up to a point 720 feet directly ahead of the outpost. From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"Thank you to SpaceX for the awesome ride up here,\" said co-pilot Nichole Ayers, an Air Force major and F-22 Raptor pilot. \"As a (space) rookie, that was one of the coolest things I've ever done. I can't wait to get to work up here.\"",
      "McClain, Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov -- both veteran commercial airline pilots \u2014 are replacing Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and his pilot, Sunita Williams.",
      "Three other crew members, cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, were launched to the station last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They're scheduled to return to Earth next month.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship. The flight was originally expected to last about eight days.",
      "But during rendezvous with the space station, the Starliner experienced propulsion system problems and NASA eventually ruled out bringing the crew down on the Boeing spacecraft.",
      "Instead, the astronauts were told to remain aboard the station while the Starliner returned to Earth on its own. NASA then bumped two astronauts from the next station flight \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 freeing up two seats for use by Wilmore and Williams.",
      "When Hague and Gorbunov reached the station, Wilmore and Williams joined them to become part of Crew 9 for a normal six-month tour of duty.",
      "Now that Crew 10 has arrived, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help familiarize their replacements with space station operations before undocking and returning to Earth next week with a splashdown in the Gulf near the coast of Florida. NASA announced on Sunday it was targeting Tuesday for the return journey, with undocking scheduled for 1:05 a.m. ET and splashdown at around 6 p.m.",
      "\"NASA and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions off Florida's coast for the return of the agency's Crew 9 mission from the International Space Station,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "\"Mission managers are targeting an earlier Crew 9 return opportunity based on favorable conditions (predicted) for the evening of Tuesday, March 18. The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week.\"",
      "If all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams upon landing will have logged 286 days in space since launch last June. While a long flight by any standard, it's still well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days \u2014 set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with around 570 days in space overall, depending on the actual launch date. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft among U.S. astronauts: 675 days over four flights.",

Two NASA astronauts who originally planned to be on that flight were bumped from the mission to free up two seats for Wilmore and Williams. They became part of Crew 9 and worked with Hague and Gorbunov for the duration of their six-month mission.",
      "The Crew 9 fliers plan to spend two days familiarizing their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation before boarding their own Crew Dragon, the same one that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, for the trip home.",
      "The flight plan calls for undocking Tuesday, setting the stage for re-entry and splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast next weekend. By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of their mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "Astronomy fans are in for a treat this March as the full moon will appear to turn red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday at 11:57 p.m. ET. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",

      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",

    "summary": "A space probe named Hera captured images of Mars' small Deimos moon while on a mission to examine an asteroid.",
    "story": [
      "A space probe flying past Mars captured images of the red planet's small, mysterious moon.",
      "The space probe, named Hera, was launched on Oct. 7, 2024, and is on a mission to gather close-up data about the Dimorphos asteroid, the European Space Agency said in a news release. The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

    "summary": "NASA will wait at least another two days to launch its next space station crew, delaying the return of Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams a bit longer.",
    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

      "A sleepy Selection Sunday this was not.",
      "North Carolina barely slid into this year's version of March Madness, a development that led its athletic director to remind everyone that he had nothing to do with that choice even though he's the head of the group that sets the bracket.",
      "Texas also made it in \u2014   barely \u2014 giving the Southeastern Conference a record 14 teams in the tournament, including overall top seed Auburn. The Tigers received higher billing than Duke even though they've lost three of their last four games.",
      "And coach Rick Pitino's reward for leading St. John's back to prominence: a journey back to where his coaching career took off with his first Final Four \u2014   Providence \u2014   and a juicy potential second-round matchup against another coaching firebrand, John Calipari of Arkansas.",
      "\"There were,\" North Carolina AD Bubba Cunningham said, \"a number of challenges\" in putting together a bracket that hoops fans can only hope provides as many thrills on the court as it did during the 60-minute bracket show.",
      "Auburn beat out Duke to receive top billing in the tournament despite those three losses over the past two weeks, and despite also dropping a game to the Blue Devils back in December.",
      "\"We've got to get our mojo back a little bit,\" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said.",
      "Blue Devils coach Jon Scheyer said Sunday on ESPN that star Cooper Flagg, who missed the team's last two games after getting injured during the ACC tournament, is hoping to return in time for the team's opening game on Friday.",
      "\"It's full steam ahead,\" Scheyer said. \"I want to get Coop back as quickly as we can. He wants to do the same. Obviously, tomorrow is important; we had an off day today and got back late. Hopefully he can start to progress starting tomorrow with doing some on-court work and build up to where can practice later in the week. Our goal is for Friday, no question about it. I know that's his goal as well.\"",
      "No. 1 seed Florida, which captured the SEC tournament by winning three games with an average margin of 15 points, opens as a slight favorite to win it all at the Final Four in San Antonio on April 5 and 7, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "Clearly, one deciding factor in choosing Auburn over Duke was the Tigers' schedule, which was second toughest in the country, largely on the strength of playing a conference that put so many teams in the field.",
      "\"The SEC had such an outstanding year, winning 88% of their nonconference games,\" Cunningham explained.",
      "Houston was the remaining top seed and could face a second-round matchup against No. 8 Gonzaga, making its 26th straight trip to the tournament.",
      "On a more \"normal\" Selection Sunday, Texas making the field with 15 losses might have been the biggest talking point.",
      "Instead, it was North Carolina's inclusion that drew the most attention.",
      "CBS analyst Seth Davis acknowledged it right away when he opened his interview with Cunningham by wondering \"whether North Carolina may have gotten a little bit of an advantage with its AD as the chair.\"",
      "Cunningham's vice-chair, Keith Gill, who, in an unusual move was also brought in for the interview, insisted it had not.",
      "\"As vice-chair, I managed all the conversations we had about North Carolina, and we had quite a few,\" Gill said. He confirmed that Cunningham was not allowed to participate in any vote about his own school.",
      "The Tar Heels were the last team in, based not on its 1-12 record against Quad 1 teams, but on its 8-0 mark against Quad 2, along with other favorable metrics, Gill said.",
      "\"You take all those things in consideration, and the committee felt they should earn that last spot,\" Gill said.",
      "Both North Carolina (vs. San Diego State) and Texas (vs. Xavier) are playing in the First Four, which kicks off the action Tuesday. The tournament gets into full swing Thursday and Friday with 32 games at eight sites around the country.",
      "Bubble teams that did not make it include West Virginia, Indiana and Boise State.",
      "Elsewhere in the bracket, Pitino leads his unprecedented sixth program into the tournament, and what a road he would have to take to get back to the Final Four.",
      "First, he will travel to Providence, the same building where the coach led the Friars to a surprise Final Four trip back in 1987, to lead second-seeded St. John's in a first-round game against Omaha. Pitino's second game could come against Arkansas and Calipari in what would be a titanic matchup between two of the game's biggest coaching names. Calipari's first game in Providence is against none other than Bill Self and seventh-seeded Kansas.",
      "Another coaching icon, Tom Izzo, leads Michigan State to its 27th straight tournament. The Spartans are seeded second and will face America East champion Bryant in its opener.",
      "There's also UConn, seeking the sport's first threepeat since the early '70s but seeded eighth with a potential second-round game against Florida next weekend.",
      "In the South region of the bracket, Iowa State earned a 3-seed, but coach T.J. Otzelberger announced shortly after the bracket was revealed that Keshon Gilbert, a senior guard, the team's second-leading scorer and leader in assists and minutes, won't play at all in the tournament. Gilbert had missed the team's Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals appearance, which ended in a 96-92 loss to BYU.",
      "\"We've decided he needs to focus on his rehab and getting his body back right, so he won't be available as we move forward,\" Otzelberger said.",
      "The biggest quirks in this year's bracket all involved the SEC:",
      "There are three potential second-round games between SEC teams \u2013 the sort of matchups the committee is asked to avoid, but that became inevitable with 14 teams in the bracket. The SEC, Big Ten (eight spots) and Big 12 (seven) captured 42.5% of the tournament's 68 spots, which leads to questions about whether March Madness really needs to expand to bring even more big-school teams into the mix. Then again, had this been a 76-team tournament, West Virginia, Indiana and Ohio State would have made the cut, according to the committee's list of \"first teams out.\" Now that the SEC has established itself as a hoops conference comes the question of whether the league can capture its first national title since 2012, when Kentucky won it all.",

      "The Trojans and Bruins, newcomers in the Big Ten this season, will try to win the first national championship for the conference since 1999, when Purdue won the lone one. A record 12 teams from the Big Ten are in the field. The SEC has 10 and the ACC eight. The Big 12 has seven.",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too.",
      "Rubio said after the arrest that the administration will be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "On Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"",
      "The secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"",
      "\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",
      "A top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Rubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"",
      "More broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.",
      "Asked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"",
      "\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels are targeting the group's ability to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. military, and are \"doing the world a favor.\"",
      "\"We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump announced the strikes Saturday, saying the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis cease shipping attacks. U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a social media post Saturday, and it's prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on reaction from the Houthis and Iran, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "U.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.",
      "Saturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"",
      "\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"",
      "The secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.",
      "\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"",
      "Asked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"",
      "Rubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"",
      "\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\"",

The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last and will it involve ground forces?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane. And in the last year- and-a-half, last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States, attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times. And 145 times, they have attacked commercial shipping.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those strikes were retaliation strikes. So they launch one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one-off.",
      "This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping. And it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way.

      "All the Biden administration would do is, they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore.",

      "Look, it's \u2013 bottom line, easy way to understand it, OK, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They have attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They have attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis, as you know.",
      "Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations.",
      "Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it, 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about.",
      "What we can't ignore and the reason why the president mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They have provided them intelligence. They have provided them guidance. They have provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, OK, the Houthis, would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran.",
      "And so this was a message to Iran. Don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships, in attacking global shipping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to.",
      "But I want to ask you about tariffs, because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back and forth the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini-trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs, on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them.",
      "So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, OK? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War.",
      "But now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low-wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us?",
      "So what the president is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability. And the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States.",
      "The second is global. And that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global \u2013 it's not against Canada. It's not against Mexico. It's not against the E.U. It's everybody.",
      "And then, from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness. But, right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements potentially with countries so that our trade is fair.",
      "What's not going to continue is \u2013 of course, these countries are upset.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral not free trade \u2013 not North American free trade deals?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, it's not leverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Renegotiation?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there we can work on deals and so forth because they will have products we don't make. We have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best.",
      "It has to be free, but it has to be fair in that country. And, right now, it's only free on one side and it's not fair for the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, sir\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's an unsustainable position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pullbacks are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week.",
      "So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seemed to negotiate \u2013 you say this was national security-minded.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But then we also see comments by the president of like 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States. That seems more emotional.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that means \u2013 that's called retaliation. That's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on \u2013 they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine.",
      "Then we will have to find something to \u2013 I mean, you tell me. I mean, Canada's going after whiskey and orange juice. And, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference?",
      "The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them. They like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo. And then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides.",
      "But what we have now cannot continue. We have deindustrialized this country, deindustrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a Rust Belt. That's why we have suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability to other places.",
      "That cannot and will not continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know \u2013 President Trump. This is no mystery. He's been talking about this since the 1980s, actually, even before he was a political figure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia.",
      "You said Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a cease-fire or whether Putin is using a delay tactic. You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think that was a promising meeting. As I have said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully, we will have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, The exchange was promising.",
      "I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front with a lot of complexity to it. So, no one's claiming that it's easy.",
      "But I want everyone to understand here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop, so that we can move to plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not \u2013 maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and that respects everybody's needs and so forth.",
      "No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end to a war as long as they're shooting at each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so the president wants a cease-fire, and that's what we're working on.",
      "Assuming we can get that done \u2013 and that won't be easy in and of itself \u2013 we move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue.",
      "The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We will talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff.",
      "I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board writes: \"The administration needs to be careful it's targeting real promoters of terrorism, not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\"",
      "Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism specifically to Hamas from this Columbia student? Or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, not just the student. We're going to do more. In fact, we \u2013 every day now, we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well.",
      "And here's why. It's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist or what have you. And, in it, you have to make certain assertions. And if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America.",
      "It's that simple. So you lied. You came \u2013 if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straightforward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any \u2013 but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. Yes, they take over \u2013 I mean, do you not \u2013 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges. Well, then you should know that this is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson, was the negotiator on \u2013 negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime, in and of itself, that they're involved and being a negotiator, the spokesperson, this, that, the other.",
      "We don't want \u2013 we don't need these people in our country. We never should have allowed him in, in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library \u2013 the buildings being vandalized, we never would have let him in.",
      "We never would have let him in to begin with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave. And so are others. And we're going to keep doing it.",
      "We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. they had no problem, OK, pressuring social media to censor American political speech.",
      "So I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this. If you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. And now that we know it, you're going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas revoked or are other points of view as well?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor \u2013 look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "They're terrorists too. I \u2013 we \u2013 the president designated them\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well.",
      "You \u2013 we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people \u2013 we don't want people in our country that are going to be\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know what we have gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Secretary Rubio, I'd like to have you back, talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who joins us this morning from Miami Beach.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a cease-fire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin.",
      "I wonder what your answer to the question is in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a cease-fire.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret.",
      "And I agree with the secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was \u2013 it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics. And I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration and where we are today.",
      "We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect Presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision-making call, or is this just next steps?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would assume that they have a \u2013 they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They have talked already after the first visit that I had with President Putin.",
      "And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision-maker, our decision-maker, and President Putin for the country of Russia is their decision-maker.",
      "I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's \u2013 that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a \u2013 an inclination on \u2013 on the part of both countries, and, by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long-term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's president publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting.",
      "We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 look, I don't \u2013 I don't know what President Macron said.",
      "I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have necessarily firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said.",
      "I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to \u2013 to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000-kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing \u2013 shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000-mile border.",
      "That's a very, very complicated cease-fire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I \u2013 I regard as promising.",
      "I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near-term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, beyond the cease-fire, a peace agreement? you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 what I \u2013 what I'm saying, the technical \u2013 what I'm saying is that a cease-fire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border. That's \u2013 that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions.",
      "We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to \u2013 to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement.",
      "There's \u2013 there's just \u2013 there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a cease-fire here. And I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined space as compared to the \u2013 the battle \u2013 where the battle is being fought in Ukraine-Russia.",
      "So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza.",
      "I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the two million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt. You've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans and, by the way, for the people of Israel.",
      "So we're exploring all of those things. But, right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab summit, where we spent 7.5 hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging.",
      "Now, to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen \u2013 that's a red line for the Israelis \u2013 and maybe could have led to a long-term peace resolution here.",
      "And yet Hamas \u2013 Hamas came up with their own construct\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: \u2026 essentially disavowed what we discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And, to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And I \u2013 I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Ambassador Witkoff, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back with more Face the Nation.",

      "Welcome back.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir. And I - I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these - in this past week. Certainly a lot of action.",
      "I looked at the last time we spoke. You were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said, there's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't mind negotiating, as long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So, I think there is a one in trillion chance the ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region.",
      "Yes, I think he - I think he's a fanatical, religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him. And if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60 percent. He has enough to make six bombs at 60 percent. So, turn that all over to the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business and we'll help you with your nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long - that's a long to-do list. And so far no - no indication that he's taking the offer.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Not really. He's - if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "We did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do - you heard the secretary of state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Ambassador Witkoff.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know yet. But I do know you play President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So, if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two, ceasefire and peace deal.",
      "What I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine or not. If you're not, go back to maximum pressure.",
      "I have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy. And I'm willing to move forward if I have to. But we're talking about a ceasefire and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But, to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting but 30 years of action. And I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gets from the discussions that Witkoff had. Who, I like Steve, and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing.",
      "I think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the - to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large.",
      "I hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: To engage in a ceasefire and to find a win/win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the U.S. decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I don't know what value these - these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the voice of America really is, Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War. People told us that. So, that's something to consider, is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you had been an advocate for soft power.",
      "I want to ask you about what's happening here at home.",
      "There were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The president suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington and Burling as well because they were involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support this?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think all of these things - I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax - a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6th was politically motivated. And people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict - you know, when Biden took - took -",

      "You know, on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family. That they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him politically and personally. I believe that. And if these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame. That's what I believe.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to talk about the impact of these tariffs and potential tariffs because you're from the manufacturing hub of Michigan.",
      "We were looking at the data. Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says this is \u2013 this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. And if you'll recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2016, and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in. I worked with him. We renegotiated it. We have the USMCA.",
      "The way that the tariffs are being done now is - it's made a ping-pong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at. We need to using them against China. But I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying. There's no way that in a month's time, when they have such an integrated inventory and production plan - production plants where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen.",
      "So, I want to work with this administration. I think the 25 percent tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. Autos are a ping-pong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We needed industrial policy. Tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a way that lets everybody plan for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the big three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2nd push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion.",
      "Do you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home, like President Trump is asking of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, if everything were go right, which, like in this world does anything ever go right, it's going to take two to three years. Our - our suppliers, also, there are many - and, by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Next -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You support this idea. Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral, not North America as a globe -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Totally. I totally - Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that.",
      "But right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, two - 60 percent of aluminum in this country - that's being used is be - coming in from Canada. You take a 25 percent tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is - is very small. It's not a big - the companies just can't eat that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But we've got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't - I - I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able - they brought 2.5 million vehicles in to - Korea, with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5, not treating everybody equally.",

Ultimately, Democrats, in the Senate, did vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Well, in the House, we were almost united, except one, and there were very strong feelings in the House about what people thought that the Senate should do.",

AFGE, who's employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because concerned about their employees. Who I'm meeting with daily when I'm out there. Came out against supporting it because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just the license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with - people are being hurt.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can Leader Jeffries actually maintain that kind of unity in the House?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: He showed you that he could do it last week. And I can tell you that when you - I don't think anybody has been home. If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.",

      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-MD): Thank you. Great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have, in your state, the Port of Baltimore. One of the country's largest ports. The president has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2nd is poised to enact 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these - of these - of these disastrous and frankly not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology. But this administration is using it like an ideology. And so, while these decisions are being made - made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore. It's also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impact on our farmers over in the eastern shore, on our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this - and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on cost. It's having very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses. It's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitive, as well as our national security. And so, these are the type of things, this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1,300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally, and is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean then you look at the - at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's - it's either ineffective, it is performative, or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all of these executive actions are falling under.",
      "And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the president of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally.",
      "And so, when we talk about the different tools that we have, just in the past week alone, you know, I signed - I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises because, on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department. And while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, D.C., out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a liberal state, and he said he's going to stop it.",
      "I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Here - here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is - is - that they - that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives.",
      "And so - so the thing that we know about this is, this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place - and we've gone - we went through this process not just for these past couple years since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland - where Maryland won this - this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitively, where we showed that we could be at a place that it was the only site ready place to build, build ready site. So, the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the president has just decided to politicize it by talking about, but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you called him? Have you called the White House?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've tried calling the White House before and - and there - there's - there's no response. And - and, frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break. I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it? But you believe it?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Do I believe the announcement?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the president thinks he has the authority to do this. But I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the president does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. And so, I believe the president of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there's a king of king and a lord of lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here. And you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do.",
      "You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but - but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering.",
      "You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continued resolution, where - where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people.",
      "And so I think, when one - when the American people, when they do not have an option or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then, yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. We are doing everything in our power to fight for the people. And I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who offered alternatives, they just weren't listened to. Do you think there's just no leader in the party?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I don't - I don't see a difference. I don't - I don't see a difference.",
      "And, frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interests, I think for the American people they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing. The performative politics, people are done, and they're exhausted by it. They just want to see results. And that's exactly what we're trying to provide in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",

Border Patrol announced the contract Saturday, saying it aims to \"close critical openings\" in the wall only partially built under Mr. Trump's direction during his first presidency. Former President Joe Biden froze funding for the border wall program when he took office.",

      "It was a remarkable moment last Tuesday: President Trump standing beside a shiny electric car at the White House making a pitch for the car's maker, Elon Musk: \"This man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this. I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people.\"",
      "For Musk \u2013 who spent about $300 million to help Trump win the White House, and who has reportedly pledged millions more to Trump's political efforts \u2013 it was a boost for Tesla's image, and a show of solidarity from the president. As he climbed into the driver's seat, Mr. Trump gushed, \"Everything's computers!\"",
      "Tesla protests across the country have been a response to the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" initiative, known as DOGE. And as the man at its helm, Musk has been presidential confidant, cost-cutter, and government contractor all at once.",

      "When asked about possible conflicts of interest given Musk's role in the Trump administration, Katie Drummond, the global editorial director of Wired (the technology publication that has scored recent scoops about Musk and his associates), says, \"It is very clear that there are conflicts of interest across the board. I mean, Elon Musk himself is one giant conflict of interest.",
      "\"When you think about SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla, you think about all of these companies that are in some way, shape or form regulated and overseen by different agencies of the federal government,\" Drummond said. \"And then you remember that the person who owns and runs all of these companies is flying on Air Force One with President Trump.

      "But in January, present at Trump's inauguration were Musk and other Silicon Valley billionaires.",
      "Asked if that represented a new power structure in this country, Drummond said, \"It's a power structure that has been growing for a while now. But I thought that the inauguration was such a stark moment of realization \u2013 I think should be a moment of realization for everyone in the United States \u2013 about who really runs this country.\"",
      "And who is running it? Elon Musk? Or President Trump?",
      "\"The technology industry,\" Drummond replied. \"You think about the trillions of dollars involved in all of those companies and those businesses. There is so much power in the technology industry, and when you combine that with, you know, essentially collusion with the federal administration, or at least a willingness to work hand-in-hand with the Trump administration, that's what we're about to see.\"",
      "Newt Gingrich is a Republican former Speaker of the House, and a long-time Trump ally. Asked if he is concerned about possible conflicts of interest  given the world's richest man's many business dealings with the federal government, Gingrich said, \"Well, I think you always have to look at the danger of conflicts of interest with anybody. But at the same time, I would say that one of the virtues of being as wealthy as he is, is he hardly needs to rig the game.\"",
      "Asked who has oversight over Musk at this point, Gingrich replied, \"Donald J. Trump. He is the chief executive officer of the United States. He was elected by the American people, and he's acting as the President of the United States.\"",
      "Gingrich became a household name three decades ago for his own push to shrink the federal government. Asked how today is different, Gingrich opined that the government is \"much sicker\" now than it was in 1995. \"It's had a huge growth of bureaucracy, a huge growth of left-wing ideology, much bigger deficits,\" he said. \"Trump has been campaigning for 10 years. He's found in Elon Musk the kind of person who has the drive, the toughness, the intelligence to really fundamentally take on the 'deep state' and change it in ways that would normally be unthinkable.\"",
      "In the 1990s, Gingrich pressured the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton to embrace conservative budget cuts. But in the Clinton-era, most reforms came only after months of deliberation and Congressional action \u2013 in stark contrast to what's happening today.",

      "Musk is not an employee of DOGE and \"has no actual or formal authority,\" White House says",
      "\"Let's be clear: Some people are gonna get hurt, let's be honest,\" Gingrich said of DOGE's broad cuts to federal programs and staff in virtually every agency. \"There'll be some people laid off that probably shouldn't have been. There'll be some contracts that are dropped that probably shouldn't have been.\"",
      "\"Or some things that happen where the government just isn't functioning well,\" I said.",
      "\"Then the question you have to ask yourself is, on balance, does this system need to be fixed, even if the risk of fixing is gonna be some things that aren't totally a hundred percent?\" Gingrich said. \"Because you slow down enough to try to avoid any possible mistake, you'll get nothing done.\"",
      "But Elaine Kamarck, a scholar at Washington's Brookings Institution, countered, \"You can't just start lopping off whole categories of workers.\"",
      "And what is the outcome if the table of government is tipped over? \"People will die,\" Kamarck said. \"It's that serious.\"",
      "In the 1990s, Karmack was effectively the Clinton administration's counterpart to Gingrich, administering what was called Rego: Reinventing Government. She said it was very different from what is being implemented by DOGE and the White House. \"What Musk is doing, and Trump, is they're testing the limits of executive power in a way that we did not,\" she said. \"We went through it the old-fashioned way: If we thought a law needed to be changed, we went to Congress and asked them to change it.\"",
      "Asked whether Democrats should work with Musk and President Trump, as Democrats tried with Republicans in the '90s, Karmack said, \"I think Democrats should try where they can, absolutely.

      "\"It's very clear, and I think should be very clear to anyone who has watched Elon Musk and how he operates for any period of time, his work ethic and his ambitions are limitless,\" said Drummond. \"I think we are really sort of only at the beginning of what has the potential to be a much more seismic transformation of these federal agencies, of the federal infrastructure, for as long as Elon Musk is involved in this transformation.\"",

      "When British novelist J.B. Priestley visited the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, he described it as \"all of Beethoven's nine symphonies in stone and magic light.\"",
      "\"If I were an American,\" he wrote, \"I should make my remembrance of it the final test of men, art, and policies \u2026 Every member or officer of the federal government ought to remind himself, with triumphant pride, that he is on the staff of the Grand Canyon.\"",
      "In February, as part of the Trump Administration's effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, approximately 1,000 employees were laid off across the Park Service. When the federal government fired some of the Park Service staff who work at the canyon, this was the scene near the South Rim:",
      "In the weeks since, there have been protests at hundreds of park service sites, from Acadia to Zion.",
      "Jim Landahl worked as a seasonal ranger for years, until he got a promotion to a permanent posting at Grand Canyon six months ago. Then came the termination email. He said it stated that \"we lacked the necessary skills, qualifications, fitness to perform this job. And I didn't take that personally at all, because I knew that was a lie. I knew that was false. Whoever wrote that letter wasn't hiking with me down into the canyon in a hundred-degree heat to do our job.\"",
      "Landahl's work involved restoring habitat disturbed by the reconstruction of the park's failing Transcanyon Waterline, which provides water to lodges and other infrastructure. Since he'd been in this position for less than a year, he was classified as a \"probationary employee.\"",
      "\"The project is a critical infrastructure project for Grand Canyon,\" said archeologist Leah Gallo. \"And without it, there would be pretty much no Grand Canyon.\"",
      "Gallo had only been working on the project for two weeks when she was let go. \"I spent pretty much every dime to move here,\" she said.",
      "But this past Thursday, two federal judges ruled that the government must reinstate thousands of fired probationary workers across several agencies, finding that the layoffs were carried out under false pretenses \u2013 that performance wasn't a factor.",

      "Judge orders 6 agencies to rehire fired federal probationary workers after \"unlawful\" terminations",
      "Mindy Riesenberg is the chief of communications for the Grand Canyon Conservancy, a non-profit group that supports the park. As we enter the busy season, she says she's worried about people having to wait in several-hour-long lines just to get into the park. \"We had almost five million visitors last year at Grand Canyon,\" she said. \"And now I think we're down to about 11 fee collectors for the South Rim, for five million people a year.\"",
      "When we visited the canyon last weekend, visitors were waiting up to an hour-and-a-half to enter the park. In New Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns National Park had cancelled all ranger-led tours. Colorado's Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument announced it would be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays due to the staffing cuts.",
      "Cuts also impact ongoing projects visitors might not see, like the Transcanyon Waterline. Riesenberg said, \"That project is going to be held up, because scientists and botanists and arborists who were replanting trees down there for shade, for safety, after that project, and that's all gonna stop. It's gonna hold the project up.\"",
      "Chuck Sams, who served as the 19th director of the National Park Service, stepped down in January. He said, \"To me, it looks like there's no rhyme or reason about why these things are taking place.\"",
      "During his time as director, Sams said, \"I absolutely felt that we needed more employees. National Park Service needs at least 15% to as much as 25% more staff on the ground in order to fully meet its mandate. It's important that these folks are out there. And now, we've seen a 10% reduction in staff. So it's gonna be detrimental to people's experiences in the parks.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the National Park Service's Office of Public Affairs told \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" \"The National Park Service remains steadfast in its commitment to serving the American public and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to our care. However, NPS policy is to not comment on litigation related to personnel matters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of current employees known as the \"Resistance Rangers\" has been tracking the cuts, speaking out on behalf of their fired coworkers.",
      "One ranger, who asked that we conceal their identity out of fear of retaliation, told us, \"None of us want to be doing this. We're public land servants. We're civil servants who just want to be doing our job. I cannot separate myself from the mission. I am doing this for the love of public lands. I'm doing this for my nieces and nephews. I'm doing this for the people to come in 150 years.\"",
      "The ranger is especially worried about the crush of visitors who will be headed to understaffed parks this spring and summer. \"We were hobbled to begin with, and now our kneecaps are cut off,\" they said. \"In addition to that, we have $12 billion in maintenance deficit. Like, every single national park you ask me about that I've been to, I can point out six or seven high-priority products that need to happen in order to protect the integrity of that place. We just had our highest visitation year ever in history; 331 million people went to parks last year. That is an absurd number of people.\"",
      "Americans love their national parks. Last year, a Pew Research Center opinion poll found that, when it comes to federal agencies, the public has the most favorable view of the National Park Service. It ranked highest with Democrats AND Republicans.",
      "Sams said, \"During my service as the National Park Service director, I had never met a member of Congress that didn't love the park that was in their home state. And I generally saw bipartisan support for the National Park Service. Moving forward, there has to be a strong understanding that parks aren't partisan. The flora and fauna, the natural and cultural resources inside of the park don't belong to any political party.\"",
      "Fired training specialist Lynda Jones joined the Park Service to serve her country. \"Both my parents are veterans,\" she said. \"They served in the military. And they instilled in me the importance of public service.\"",
      "While Thursday's court rulings have reinstated her position at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (at least temporarily), the Trump administration has appealed \u2013 and a larger reduction in force is still possible.",
      "Which leaves park staff like Jones dealing with an uncertain future, worried about what's to come. \"This is the story of America,\" Jones said, tearing up. \"The story of the people who live here. And it doesn't matter your background or where you're from. These places belong to all of us. And they really are America's best idea.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican on Sunday released the first photograph of pope in more than a month, showing Pope Francis wearing a purple Lenten liturgical vestments sitting in a wheelchair in front of an altar in the hospital chapel.",
      "The Vatican said he was participating in the celebration of the Mass with other priests. No one else is visible in the photo. It is the first photograph of the pope since he was hospitalized on Feb. 14 with a severe case of bronchitis, which developed into double pneumonia. It is also the first time the Vatican mentions that the pope has participated in celebrating a Mass in the period.",
      "Children's prayers for the pope",
      "Earlier, dozens of children toting yellow and white balloons \u2014 many from war-torn countries \u2014 gathered outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to greet Pope Francis on his fifth Sunday hospitalized. While the pope did not appear from the 10th-floor suite of windows, he thanked them and acknowledged their presence in the traditional Sunday blessing.",
      "\"I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to Gemelli as a sign of closeness,'' the pontiff said in the Angelus text prepared for the traditional prayer but not delivered live again. \"Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you,'' Francis said.",
      "The Rev. Enzo Fortunato, president of the pontifical committee for World Children's Day who organized the event, said that the gathering of children with their parents was a form of spiritual medicine for the 88-year-old pontiff. He called it ''the most beautiful caress.''",
      "\"The children represent a symbolic medicine for Pope Francis,'' Fortunato said. ''Letting him know that so many children are here for him cheers the heart.''",
      "A small group of children, whose balloons represented the colors of the Vatican flag, briefly entered the hospital to leave behind their drawings, messages and flowers for Francis. Many of the children came from poorer Italian districts or from countries impacted by war, some having arrived in Italy from Afghanistan and Syria via humanitarian corridors set up by the Sant'Egidio charity in agreement with the Italian government; others were from Ukraine, Gaza, South America and Africa.",
      "One of them was 12-year-old Anastasia, who got up at 5 a.m. to make the trip from Naples with the hopes of delivering the message directly to the pope. \"I wrote, 'Pope Francis, get well and return home soon,'\" she said. \"We love you, all of the children are praying for you.''",
      "\"Pope of the children\"",
      "Andrea Iacomini, the spokesman for UNICEF in Italy, said besides demonstrating affection for the pope, the group also wanted to say \"enough'' to conflicts that are impacting 500 million children in 59 countries.",
      "\"This pope is not just a religious leader, he is a great global leader. A man of peace. This pope is pope of the children.'' Iacomini said.",
      "Francis typically delivers the Angelus from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square to the gathered faithful, who have grown more numerous due to the Jubilee year that Francis inaugurated in December.",
      "In the written text, Francis said he was thinking of others, who like him, are in a fragile state. \"Our bodies are weak, but even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope,'' the pope said.",
      "Along with a stop at St. Peter's to seek indulgences by walking through the basilica's Holy Door, pilgrims are now also adding a stop at Gemelli, a 15-minute train ride from the Vatican.",
      "Pope's condition remains complex",
      "Doctors this week said the pontiff was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but they have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.",
      "Still, they are issuing fewer medical bulletins as the pontiff has been on an upward trajectory. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing.",
      "Francis has not been seen publicly since he was admitted to the hospital Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.",
      "The first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.",
      "Doctors in the most recent medical update on Saturday said they were working to reduce the pope's nighttime reliance on the non-invasive ventilation mask, which will allow his lungs to work more.",
      "Doctors underlined that while the pope's condition is stable, he still requires hospitalization for treatment along with physical and respiratory therapy, which are \"showing further gradual improvements,\" the Vatican said Saturday in the first medical update in three days.",
      "The next update won't be issued until mid-week, the Vatican said."

      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. launched strikes Saturday in Yemen as President Trump said the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until Houthis cease shipping attacks.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft,  and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "He said the relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and global economy billions of dollars while putting innocent lives at risk. He also added that \"your attacks must stop, starting today.\"",
      "U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a\u00a0social media post Saturday that includes a video of a fighter jet taking off from an aircraft carrier.",
      "A U.S. official confirmed the strikes to CBS News Saturday and said the reports of strikes in Sana'a are just the start, according to the official. U.S. Central Command is prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on how the Houthis and/or Iran react, per a U.S. official and a source with knowledge.",
      "At least 13 people were killed, and another nine were wounded as a result of the strikes, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The strikes come days after Houthi rebels said earlier this week that they would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza.",
      "The Houthis, operating out of Yemen, have been backed, supplied and trained by Iran for years. After Hamas launched its deadly terrorist attack in Israel in October 2023, the terrorist group initially stated they would only shoot at ships linked to Israel, in support of the Palestinian people, but\u00a0U.S. officials have said that the group has targeted ships that have no connection to Israel's war.",
      "The U.S., Israel and United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen.",
      "Iran has close ties with Russia. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement Saturday evening that Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a call Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during which Rubio informed Lavrov of \"U.S. military deterrence operations against the Iran-backed Houthis and emphasized that continued Houthi attacks on U.S. military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated.\"",
      "In January, days after he took office Mr. Trump designated the Houthis a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Former President Joe Biden had removed the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2021 but then re-designated them as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in early 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Cuba suffered a massive power outage Friday night affecting Havana and the country's provinces that left millions in the dark.",
      "Cuba's Ministry of Energy and Mines said at around 8:15 p.m. local time an outage at the Diezmero substation on the outskirts of Havana had caused \"a significant loss of generation in western Cuba and, with it, the failure of the National Electric System.\"",
      "The ministry said on its account on the social platform X that it is \"working on the recovery process.\"",
      "The streets of Havana were dark and empty, with light coming only from the windows of hotels that had generators. Internet and telephone service were intermittent about 18 hours after power went out.",
      "People in provinces as far away as Guant\u00e1namo, Artemisa, Santiago de Cuba, and Santa Clara reported experiencing blackouts with just flickers of light.",
      "Earlier, the Electric Union, the state agency that regulates the sector, said in its daily report that peak-hour demand would be around 3,250 megawatts and the deficit would reach around 1,380 megawatts, meaning 42% of the national energy system would be shut down. This figure is not the highest in recent memory.",
      "Cuba suffered\u00a0widespread outages in its national energy system at the end of last year, leaving the island in the dark amid a serious economic crisis.",
      "The 2024 blackout was considered to be Cuba's worst in two years after Hurricane Ian made landfall as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations.",
      "Cuba's power grid has been plagued by frequent outages, with more than half of the country experiencing power cuts during peak hours. The outages are primarily caused by fuel shortages and aging infrastructure. In many parts of the island, electricity is crucial for cooking and water pumping.",
      "Authorities on the island have begun a program to install photovoltaic parks and promised that dozens of them will be ready this year. Blackouts previously prompted anti-government demonstrations in 2021, 2022, and 2024.",

      "\"As wombats are so often hit on Australian roads, I stopped to ensure they got off the road safely and didn't get hit,\" Jones said.",
      "\"However, as is seen from the video, when I walked up to them, the joey did not move or run off. I was concerned it may have been sick or injured, and made a snap judgement to pick up the joey and see if that was the case,\" she added.",
      "An unidentified man laughs as he films Jones saying: \"I caught a baby wombat.\" They both note the mother's sounds of aggression.",

      "Ahead of the demonstration, Vucic repeatedly warned of alleged plans for unrest while threatening arrests and harsh sentences for any incidents.",
      "A deafening sound of whistles, drums and vuvuzelas filled the air on Saturday. Some protesters carried banners that read, \"He's Finished!\" Crowds chanted \"Pump it Up,\" a slogan adopted during past four months of student-led protests.",

      "The rally \u2014 which is expected to be the biggest anti-government protest ever held in the Balkan country \u2014 comes after more than four months of anti-corruption demonstrators that have posed the biggest challenge to Vucic's grip on power after 13 years in charge.",
      "Protesting university students have led the nationwide anti-graft movement, which started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station and killed 15 people in Serbia's north on Nov. 1. Many in Serbia blamed the crash on rampant government corruption, negligence and disrespect of construction safety regulations.",
      "On Friday evening, tens of thousands of people staged a joyous welcome for the students who have been marching or cycling for days from across Serbia toward Belgrade.",

      "Vucic has rejected earlier proposals for a transitional government that would prepare an early election. Fueling fears of clashes, Vucic's supporters have been camping in central Belgrade in front of his headquarters. They include ex-members of a dreaded paramilitary unit involved in the assassination in 2003 of Serbia's first democratic Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, as well as soccer hooligans who are known for causing violence.",
      "Private N1 television on Saturday broadcast footage of dozens of young men with baseball caps going into the pro-Vucic camp.",

The Vatican office for the synod, or gathering of bishops, released a timetable through 2028 to implement the reforms and said Francis had approved the calendar last week.",

Eagles said Mooney attempted to cross the border with her visa paperwork and a job offer from a company in the U.S. An ICE spokesperson confirmed Mooney's detainment in a statement to CBS News, saying she didn't have legal documentation to be in the U.S.",
      "Mooney was crossing the border to apply for a temporary visa known as a TN visa, which she had previously obtained successfully, according to Canadian broadcaster Global News. The TN visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the U.S. in certain professional jobs under the terms of the North American free trade pact known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Her visa was denied, and she was held at the San Ysidro border crossing in Southern California for three nights, according to Eagles. She was then transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego and held for another three nights.",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "They did not immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would occur - or what it expected to get in return.",

      "The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war, and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.",
      "Israel has been pressing Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "A group that represents the families of most captives said Friday that it welcomed plans to release any but that the focus must remain on returning all.",
      "\"Without a comprehensive deal, we risk sealing the fate of all remaining hostages,\" the Hostage Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "Two weeks ago, Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza and its more than 2 million people as it pressed Hamas to agree. Hamas has said that the move would affect the remaining hostages as well.",
      "Hamas claims, with support cut off to Gaza, some 80% of the population has now lost access to food sources, with aid distribution halted and markets running out of supplies, while 90% are unable to access clean drinking water.",
      "Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace.",
      "The developments came as Jews began celebrating the Purim holiday, and Muslims continued marking the holy month of Ramadan. Some 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed Friday at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site.

      "Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance and the public to inform on women refusing to wear the country's mandatory headscarf in public, even as hard-liners push for harsher penalties for those protesting the law, a United Nations report released Friday found.",
      "The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the \"physical violence\" that led to the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death led to nationwide protests against the country's mandatory hijab laws and the public disobedience against them that continues today, despite the threat of violent arrest and imprisonment.",
      "\"Two and a half years after the protests began in September 2022, women and girls in Iran continue to face systematic discrimination, in law and in practice, that permeates all aspects of their lives, particularly with respect to the enforcement of the mandatory hijab,\" the report said.",
      "\"The state is increasingly reliant on state-sponsored vigilantism in an apparent effort to enlist businesses and private individuals in hijab compliance, portraying it as a civic responsibility.\"",
      "Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the findings of the 20-page report.",
      "In it, U.N. investigators outline how Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance. Among the efforts include Iranian officials deploying \"aerial drone surveillance\" to monitor women in public places. At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities installed facial recognition software at its entrance gate to also find women not wearing the hijab, it said.",
      "Surveillance cameras on Iran's major roadways also are believed to be involved in searching for uncovered women. U.N. investigators said they obtained the \"Nazer\" mobile phone app offered by Iranian police, which allows \"vetted\" members of the public and the police to report on uncovered women in vehicles, including ambulances, buses, metro cars and taxis.",
      "\"Users may add the location, date, time and the license plate number of the vehicle in which the alleged mandatory hijab infraction occurred, which then 'flags' the vehicle online, alerting the police,\" the report said. \"It then triggers a text message (in real-time) to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them that they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws, and that their vehicles would be impounded for ignoring these warnings.\"",
      "Those text messages have led to dangerous situations. In July 2024, police officers shot and paralyzed a woman who activists say had received such a message and was fleeing a checkpoint near the Caspian Sea.",
      "Amini's death sparked months of protests and a security crackdown that killed more than 500 people and led to the detention of more than 22,000. After the mass demonstrations, police dialed down enforcement of hijab laws, but it ramped up again in April 2024 under what authorities called the Noor - or \"Light\" - Plan. At least 618 women have been arrested under the Noor Plan, the U.N. investigators said, citing a local human rights activist group in Iran.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran executed at least 938 people last year, a threefold increase from 2021, the U.N. said. While many were convicted of drug charges, the report said the executions \"indicate a nexus with the overall repression of dissent in this period.\"",
      "\"This is in line with the authorities' longstanding use of the death penalty and executions to instill fear and as a tool of political repression against dissenting voices, including protesters and minorities,\" the U.N. report said.",
      "As Iran continues its crackdown over the hijab, it also faces an economic crisis over U.S. sanctions due to its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While U.S. President Donald Trump has called for new negotiations, Iran has yet to respond to a letter he sent to its 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Social unrest, coupled with the economic woes, remain a concern for Iran's theocracy.",

      "\"Right now, GSA is losing money,\" Murphy said. \"The federal buildings that they own have over $370 billion in deferred maintenance. That's a liability that is just growing and growing and growing because the buildings haven't been maintained. So getting rid of owned space that hasn't been maintained and that isn't occupied, first of all, takes that off the government's books, gets rid of that liability. But it also creates opportunities in communities. Having a building that's unoccupied isn't good for a city. It isn't good for the state. It isn't good for anyone.\"",

      "Murphy said terminating leases and selling unused office space will benefit the government twofold. First, it can shore up money to fund government agencies in the short term. Second, it will reduce long-term financial obligations.",
      "\"No taxpayer should want the government to be paying for space it doesn't use,\" Murphy said. \"It's billions of dollars a year [that] go out in rent and real estate payments from the federal government. This is a substantial amount of money, and it's a real chance for GSA to do a great job for the American people and reduce the long-term financial obligations of the government and, frankly, free up money for agencies in the short term as well.\"",

We need to do more, but I really want to work together with you ... to make sure that we will have a NATO which is really reinvigorated under your leadership. And we are getting there.",

      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites.

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "5. Report suspicious activity:\u00a0If you receive a text that seems off, report it immediately to your mobile carrier, local law enforcement or the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Reporting helps authorities track down scammers and prevent further attacks.",
      "6. Consider using a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure to smishing attacks by removing your sensitive information \u2014 like phone numbers, addresses and email details \u2014 from data broker websites. Scammers often rely on these publicly available databases to target victims with personalized phishing texts. These services aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can make it harder for cybercriminals to find and exploit your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",

      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

      "This vulnerability resides in WebKit, the open-source browser engine that powers Safari, Mail, App Store and other apps on Apple devices.

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "5 ways you can protect your personal data",
      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The malicious extension highlights that Google isn\u2019t doing enough to keep malware off its platform. Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",

      "SpyLend is a serious threat because it steals a huge amount of personal information. It digs into contact lists and call histories, reads text messages, including banking alerts, and grabs photos and videos from storage.",
      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",
      "This stolen data is not just used for blackmail, as it is often sold to cybercriminals. By preying on people already struggling financially, SpyLend puts nearly every part of their digital lives at risk.",

      "2) Install strong antivirus software: Use strong antivirus protection on all your devices to detect and prevent malicious apps. This can also protect against phishing emails and ransomware scams. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious apps is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "The promise of quick and easy money can be tempting, especially during tough times, making it easy to fall for these scams. However, there are safer and more reliable ways to take loans. As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

      "\"He was repeatedly failed by his own family and the justice system, who neglected to see him for who he was: a wounded child in need of support,\" Weiss said in a statement. \"Mikal\u2019s story is one of trauma, neglect, and the many missed opportunities for providing him the safety and compassion that every child should have.\"",
      "Mahdi stole a gun and a car in Virginia on July 14, 2004, when he was 21, arrest records show. The next day, he shot and killed a North Carolina store clerk as the clerk was checking his identification. A couple of days later, he carjacked someone at an intersection in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "On July 18, 2004, while on the run after those crimes, Mahdi hid in Orangeburg, South Carolina, public safety officer James Myers' shed. Mahdi ambushed Meyers when the officer returned from a birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said.",
      "The potential sixth execution for Steven Bixby, who was convicted in the killing of two police officers in 2003, has been postponed. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "Myers, 56, was shot eight or nine times, including twice in the head after falling to the ground. A pathologist testified that at least seven of the shots would have been fatal.",
      "Mahdi then set Myers' body on fire and ran away. Myers' wife discovered her husband's dead body in the shed, which they had used for the backdrop of their wedding.",
      "On July 21, 2004, Mahdi was taken into custody in Florida. When one of the officers involved in his arrest learned what he was wanted for in South Carolina, he thanked Mahdi for not shooting at him. Mahdi told him that the only reason he did not was because he was skeptical that he could successfully shoot two officers and their K-9 and get away with it.",
      "While behind bars, Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape. One was an Allen wrench and the others were homemade handcuff keys, including one that was found under his tongue at his trial.",
      "On death row, Mahdi stabbed a guard and struck another worker with a concrete block. On three occasions, prison staff found sharpened metal in his cell that could be used as a knife.",
      "During his trial, Mahdi\u2019s lawyers said their client was the second son of a woman who was wedded in an arranged marriage at 16-years-old. His family described a chaotic childhood, although nobody testified about abuse or mental illness.",
      "Mahdi pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced by Judge Clifton Newman, who at the time told The Post and Courier that he was not sure he believed in the death penalty, but the case became bigger than his beliefs.",

      "\"My challenge and my commitment throughout my judicial career has been to temper justice with mercy and to seek to find the humanity in every defendant that I sentence,\" Newman said as he handed down Mahdi\u2019s punishment. \"That sense of humanity seems not to exist in Mikal Deen Mahdi\"",
      "Once one of the busiest for executions, South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year pause caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs due to pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials.",

      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News, former Israeli hostage Tal Shoham describes the first moments of being captured by Hamas terrorists.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: After surviving nearly a year and a half deep underground, with barely enough air to breathe and no light, and sharing an 18-square-foot space with three other men, recently released hostage Tal Shoham shared with Fox News Digital his harrowing story of captivity at the hands of Hamas.",
      "Shoham was forcibly taken from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri on\u00a0October 7, 2023. His wife and children, ages four and eight, were also kidnapped that day, but he didn\u2019t know that when he was thrown into the trunk of a car and driven into Gaza by Hamas terrorists. He didn\u2019t even know whether his family was alive; hoping to save them, he surrendered to the terrorists just before they set fire to the house where his family was hiding.",
      "He would spend the eight-and-a-half months in an underground tunnel and another five months captive in five different houses deep inside Gaza, where his captors kept him shackled, starved him and deprived him of basic human comforts.",

      "But he gave himself a mission: He was determined not to lose his humanity. Even in moments when he feared that he was facing death, he tried to stay focused. \"I am not a victim. Even if this ends, I will end it with my head high, looking death in the eyes. They won\u2019t break me, and I will not surrender to self-pity. We are stronger than the other side,\" he said.",
      "It has been three weeks since he came home, and he is ready to speak. Kibbutz Be\u2019eri is just nine kilometers \u2014 about five-and-a-half miles \u2014\u00a0from Gaza, but that short distance is practically an ocean between what he describes as two worlds. \"Half-an-hour\u2019s drive, two separate worlds,\" he said. \"The first \u2014 unbelievably surreal, cruel beyond reason. And just 30 minutes away [on this side of the border], a world of sanity, logic, dignity and compassion.\"",
      "He remembers every detail of his 505 days in captivity. Tal wants to tell his story for the sake of the two fellow captives\u00a0who remain behind, starving, abused and at constant risk of death. \"Just as someone emerges from a womb alive, I emerged from the tunnel I was held in and was born again,\" he says. But the men he calls his \"brothers,\" Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, are still held underground. \"I can\u2019t sleep at night knowing they are still there,\" he says.",

He said everyone entered the safe room, and as the sounds of gunfire drew closer, they tried to barricade themselves inside. But the terrorists pried open the window, and Tal feared they might toss in a grenade if the family did not surrender. On the same street, the terrorists set fire to every other home, burning the people inside alive.",
      "\"I went out and raised my hands,\" he said. \"A man with murder in his eyes led me onto the road and to a vehicle. I saw about 40 heavily armed terrorists. Some of them were filming me on their phones. I was in shock \u2014 there was an entire battalion of Hamas terrorists inside our kibbutz, bodies of people I knew who were murdered on the ground, and they are laughing, unafraid.\"",

      "The terrorists threw him into the trunk of a car and drove him across the border, into Gaza. There, a crowd gathered. \"Teenagers with sticks ran toward me, trying to beat me from all sides,\" he says. Taking him from the car, his captors pointed a rifle at him, ready, he believed, to execute him, and tried to force him to kneel. \"I said, \u2018I can\u2019t control whether you kill me or not,\u2019 and I raised my hands \u2014 but I refused to kneel. \u2018If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS.\u2019\"",
      "He was then paraded through the streets in what he described as a \"victory march.\" \"They were shouting, \u2018Soldier! Pig! Zionist!\u2019 A mob gathered around, boys with wooden clubs trying to hit me. But I just waved and smiled. I didn\u2019t show fear. \u2018You\u2019ve captured me, but you won\u2019t see terror in my eyes.\u2019\"",
      "He was first taken to the home of a family, where he was held, alone and always shackled, for 34 days. Though he was allowed to periodically shower, the captivity was otherwise severe.",
      "His food was strictly rationed. \"For the first three days, I had pita bread. Then, they stopped giving me that,\" he says. \"Food supplies dwindled. Some days, I would receive three spoons of avocado and three dates, or half an orange from a tree in the yard.\"",
      "But the worst torment was not knowing whether his family was alive. \"I am 40 years old. Never in my life have I experienced suffering like this. The isolation, being alone with relentless thoughts \u2014that was worse than even extreme hunger.\"",
      "To endure, he made a heartbreaking decision. \"I had to accept that my family was dead,\" Tal says. \"I sat on the floor and imagined myself at their funeral. I stood in front of a grave \u2014 one large for my wife, and two small for my children \u2014 and I eulogized each of them. I thanked them for the time we had. I told them to move on. I sobbed but didn\u2019t let my captors see me cry. That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done \u2014 burying my family in my mind.\"",

      "On the 34th day of his captivity, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were brought to the home. The Hamas terrorists tortured them daily, hitting them, denying them food while eating in front of them. The hostages were allowed only about 300 calories a day \u2014 Shoham's weight dropped from 174 pounds to 110 pounds when he was released \u2014 and speaking was forbidden. \"We couldn\u2019t move from our beds or talk. We whispered everything,\" he said.",
      "Then came some glimmer of hope. On the 50th day of his captivity, Tal received proof of life from his wife \u2014 a letter telling him she and the children had been held hostage but were being released. \"I read it, my hands shaking,\" he said. \"The most important thing had happened \u2014 my family was safe. I didn\u2019t need to be a father and husband protecting them anymore. Now, I could focus on my war, the one I knew how to fight, the one for survival.\"",

      "The Tunnel",
      "By June 2024, Tal, Guy and Evyatar were moved by an ambulance\u00a0that Hamas used\u00a0for discreetly transporting hostages, to an underground tunnel, where there already was another captive, Omer Wenkert. There were four mattresses on the floor and a hole in the ground for a toilet. The space was illuminated by a single, dim lightbulb. \"It took me weeks to stop feeling like the walls were closing in, to adapt to the oxygen deprivation,\" Tal says.",
      "They were given just 300 milliliters of water a day \u2014 a little more than 10 ounces. They could use it to either drink or wash their hands. Rice was all they had to eat. Months passed. They were beaten, monitored by cameras, randomly deprived of food and sleep. The guards were Hamas tunnel diggers \u2014 digging every day, even as war raged above. \"Hamas never stopped digging tunnels,\" Tal Says. \"Not for a single day.\"",
      "The conditions were so bad that both he and Evyatar developed severe infections. But it would be months before a doctor would come to see them. \"My leg turned blue, yellow, and purple with internal bleeding,\" He recalls. \"They gave us all blood thinners, fearing we might develop clots from prolonged immobility. Eventually, they realized the issue was malnutrition and provided us with vitamin supplements for seven days. It tasted like dog food, but it dramatically improved our condition.\"",
      "ISRAEL SAYS HAMAS SENT A TODDLER TO A MILITARY OUTPOST",
      "Guy Gilboa-Dalal is still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists. \u00a0 (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "But the abuse continued. A new guard arrived, even more violent than the previous ones. \"He made some of us kneel like dogs and beat us,\" he says. \"He would come in screaming that we were filthy Jews, hit us, and then 10 minutes later, he would smile and bring food.\"",
      "Then, what seemed like a miracle. Tal and Omer were named as part of the\u00a0hostage-release deal\u00a0in February. When he was led outside after many months underground, still blindfolded, he felt moisture on his face. \"Is it rain?\" he asked. \"No,\" his captors responded, \"\u2019It is dew.\u2019 And I realized, my name, Tal, is \u2018dew\u2019 in Hebrew. I felt the morning dew on my skin.\"",
      "There were humiliations to come before he was handed over to the Red Cross and returned to Israel: a procession on a stage in the heart of Rafah where he was forced to repeat Hamas propaganda.\u00a0 But he said he didn\u2019t care \u2014 he was going home. When he arrived in Israel, he was taken to the Re\u2019im base, where his wife, Adi, and their two children, Nave and Yahel, were waiting for him. \"It was a dream come true, yet it still felt like a dream,\" Tal says. \"It took a few days to fully grasp that it was real. It was hard to take in. The emotions flooded me, like I was floating above everything.\"",
      "And there was tragic news to absorb. Eleven members of Tal\u2019s family were kidnapped or murdered on October 7. Adi\u2019s father, Avshalom Haran, and two uncles, Lilach and Evyatar Kipnis, were killed. His mother-in-law, Shoshan Haran, was taken, along with two other relatives \u2014 Sharon Avigdori and her daughter, Noam Avigdori \u2014 who were later released in the first hostage deal. Two other relatives who had come from the United States to celebrate a birthday, 59-year-old Judith Raanan, and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz.",

The terrorists brought in whatever horrors they wanted, inflicted whatever cruelty and pain they could, imposed their inhumanity on us. But within our space, we preserved our inner cleanliness, our humanity between one another. And that was crucial to making it out unbroken.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Trump administration officials Sunday announced the deportations of hundreds of immigrants the White House alleges are members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador under the wartime Alien Enemies Act after a judge temporarily blocked the effort Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe president invoked this authority to deport nearly 300 of them who are now in El Salvador, where they will be behind bars where they belong, rather than roaming freely in American communities,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance added in a post on X Sunday night that President Donald Trump deported \"violent criminals and rapists.\"",
      "It is not clear how the government determined the nearly 300 men were part of the gang or whether they had U.S. court hearings or immigration hearings, as the Alien Enemies Act allows the government to deport certain nationals in times of war without trial.",
      "A judge Saturday ordered any deportation flights that were carrying anyone subject to the presidential proclamation to return to the United States if they were currently in flight. The ruling, however, did not apply to migrants who had already landed in foreign countries before the court order or those subject to removal from the country for reasons separate from Trump's proclamation.",
      "The government said in a filing Sunday afternoon that \u201csome gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory\" before the court order was issued.",
      "It is unclear, however, whether any of the deportees had already landed in El Salvador before the judge\u2019s ruling or whether the Trump administration defied the order.",
      "Leavitt denied in a statement Sunday that the White House defied the court order and said the judge's ruling barring all deportation flights under Trump's proclamation was issued after \"terrorist [Tren De Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.\"",
      "\u201cThe written order and the Administration\u2019s actions do not conflict,\" Leavitt said. \"Moreover, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear \u2014 federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the President\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from U.S. soil and repel a declared invasion.\"",
      "Two senior Trump administration officials told NBC News they expect the court fight over the president\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to ultimately head to the Supreme Court, where they believe the administration will win.",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a rarely used authority, on Saturday in an effort to deport immigrants he alleged were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. But ahead of his proclamation, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit saying the administration was preparing to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelan men.",
      "A federal judge initially issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the administration from deporting the five men under the Alien Enemies Act and later blocked its use for deportations of all non-U.S. citizens who were in custody and subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation.",
      "\u201cAny plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\u201d\u00a0James\u00a0Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said Saturday. \u201cThose people need to be returned to the United States.\u201d",
      "Two flights holding Venezuelans were in transit during the judge\u2019s ruling, according to a source familiar with the matter. NBC News could not confirm whether the flights turned around following the order.",
      "A blue \u201cGlobal X\u201d plane took off from Harlingen, Texas, on Saturday afternoon, landing at El Salvador International Airport about an hour after the judge\u2019s ruling, according to an NBC News analysis of flight tracking databases. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video to X on Sunday that appeared to show several deportees being taken off of a blue \u201cGlobal X\u201d plane and taken into the custody of heavily armed Salvadoran authorities.",
      "NBC News cannot confirm whether the flights that landed in El Salvador carrying Venezuelans were the two flights that were in the air at the time of the judge\u2019s order.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer arguing the case for the ACLU, said Sunday that his team asked \u201cthe government to assure the court that nobody was removed\u201d in violation of the order. The government had not responded as of early afternoon, Gelernt said.",
      "Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said that if the administration is allowed to violate a court order with \u201cimpunity,\u201d the nation could barrel toward a constitutional crisis.",
      "\u201cNow that\u00a0Congress has shown itself subservient to the wishes of the White House, the judiciary is the last check against the exercise of autocratic power in the president,\u201d Gillers said. \u201cThe question before the country is whether the judges will use their contempt and other powers to resist the elimination of checks and balances in order to protect the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials touted the deportations Sunday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio thanked Bukele, saying in a statement that he \u201chas volunteered to imprison these violent criminals.\u201d Rubio said that \u201chundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country.\u201d",
      "Leavitt also praised the deportations on X, saying that \u201cthanks to the great work of the Department of State, these heinous monsters were extracted and removed to El Salvador where they will no longer be able to pose any threat to the American People.\u201d",
      "Neither Rubio\u2019s nor Leavitt\u2019s statements referred to the judge\u2019s order or detailed whether the administration was in compliance.",
      "Rubio also referred to wanting to \u201cget rid of Tren de Aragua members\u201d in an interview with CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "Asked about the arrest of activist Mahmoud Khalil and whether only people who express support for Palestinians could have their visas revoked, Rubio pointed to actions taken against Tren de Aragua.",
      "\u201cWe want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members. They\u2019re terrorists, too,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe president designated them \u2014 asked me to designate and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them, as well.\u201d",
      "Bukele said Sunday on X that 238 members of Tren de Aragua arrived in the country \u201ctoday.\u201d The United States also deported 23 MS-13 members to El Salvador, Bukele added. Also Sunday, Bukele posted an image of a headline about the judge\u2019s order, writing \u201cOopsie... Too late\u201d with a laughing emoji."

    "summary": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s financial interests in China have raised concern that they could influence his work as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "SHANGHAI \u2014 With billionaire tech executive Elon Musk busy upending the U.S. government with deep cuts as the Trump administration slashes the federal workforce, one of the companies that helped him build his fortune has reached a new milestone in China.",
      "Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla now has two facilities in Shanghai. Along with the nearby Gigafactory, Tesla\u2019s first production center outside the United States, the new $200 million Megapack battery plant that opened last month is critical to Musk\u2019s continued success in China and beyond.",
      "The Gigafactory produces 1 out of every 2 Teslas in the world, or about 1 million cars a year. In addition to producing for the Chinese market, it exports cars to Europe and other parts of Asia, though not yet to the U.S.",
      "Musk\u2019s cars have been credited with helping China to create an EV industry that now leads the world. In exchange, China has become Tesla\u2019s biggest market outside the U.S.",
      "\u201cChina is absolutely central to the success story of Tesla globally,\u201d said Michael Dunne, chief executive of the San Diego-based advisory service Dunne Insights. \u201cTake China out of the picture, we have a completely different Tesla.\u201d",
      "That is exactly the problem.",
      "Through Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, he has gained tremendous sway over the U.S. government, even as he retains substantial financial interests in China, which the U.S. considers its main strategic competitor.",
      "With his role as a Trump adviser and his high profile in China, where he has met with senior leaders including the foreign minister, Musk has been held up as a potential bridge between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But it remains unclear to whose advantage that will be.",
      "\u201cIt would be very striking and unlikely if Beijing doesn\u2019t see this as a great gift,\u201d said Isaac Stone Fish, chief executive of Strategy Risks, a research firm based in New York.",
      "\u201cBeijing is long used to using what it calls friends, the technical Chinese term for \u2018useful idiots,\u2019 for folks who can advance the interests of the Communist Party,\u201d Stone Fish said. \u201cBeijing is very used to using people like Elon Musk to do that.\u201d",
      "Though Musk is widely admired in China as an innovator and businessman, his fortunes here could also shift rapidly if U.S.-China relations sour and the public begins to associate him more with Trump administration policies.",
      "The White House, DOGE and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The White House has said Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative is unrelated to U.S. foreign policy, while the Chinese Embassy in Washington says the U.S. business community has long been a \u201cstaunch force\u201d for U.S.-China relations.",
      "\u201cWe welcome American companies to continue investing and developing in China, playing an active role as a bridge and contribute to a stable, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement.",
      "A crucial market",
      "Musk broke ground on the Gigafactory in January 2019, making Tesla the first foreign carmaker to set up a factory in China without a Chinese partner.",
      "Ten months later, the factory was up and running in what businesspeople here like to call \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "China now accounts for more than a third of Tesla\u2019s global sales, with more than 657,000 vehicles sold here last year. As of June, Tesla had 520 stores across the country."

      "The AP typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Clemishire said she would like her name included.",
      "Morris was known to be politically active. The church hosted President Donald Trump on its Dallas campus in 2020 for a discussion on race relations and the economy.",
      "Morris could face up to 20 years in prison for each of the five charges, according to the attorney general\u2019s office."

      "The Cincinnati Bengals have agreed to four-year extensions with receivers Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, assuring that Joe Burrow will have his top two targets with him for some time.",
      "A person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press that Chase will become the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, earning $161 million, including $112 million guaranteed. That surpasses the $40 million per year average by Cleveland pass rusher Myles Garrett.",
      "Higgins will get $115 million. The Bengals placed the franchise tag on Higgins, but were hopeful of getting a new deal done.",
      "The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the move.",
      "Fox Sports was the first to report on the extensions.",
      "Chase led the league in receptions (127), yards receiving (1,708) and touchdown catches (17) this past season, becoming just the sixth wide receiver in the Super Bowl era to achieve the receiving triple crown.",
      "Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin reiterated recently at the NFL scouting combine that he wanted to make Chase one of the highest-paid players in the league.",
      "\u201cJa\u2019Marr is always going to be our priority,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic football player. He\u2019s going to end up being the No. 1 paid non-quarterback in the league. We\u2019re there. Let\u2019s get it done.\u201d",

      "His best game last season was on Dec. 28 against Denver, when he had 11 receptions for 131 yards and three touchdowns, including a 3-yard score in overtime that kept the Bengals alive for another week in the postseason chase. Cincinnati won its final five games to finish 9-8, but missed the playoffs for the second straight year.",
      "\u201cYou can pull up three years ago, talking about doing a long-term deal with Tee and here we are today, still talking about doing a long-term deal,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m in charge of a football team, I want Tee Higgins and so I\u2019m going to do what I can to get Tee Higgins.\u201d",
      "Higgins was a second-round pick by the Bengals in 2020, the same season Burrow was the top overall pick. Higgins has at least 900 receiving yards in four of his five seasons, and had more than 1,000 yards in 2021 and \u201822.",

      "\u201cWe have a lot of really good football players, fantastic football players. And we\u2019re fortunate to be in a position where we can fit them all in. We\u2019ve managed our cap well,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cWe want a high payroll and low dead money, so the people that are in Cincinnati playing for us can get all the money.",
      "\u201cWe want to re-sign these guys, reward them for their ability level and add to the football team. It\u2019s a tall task, but we think we\u2019re up to it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "North Carolina probably won't become champions of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Yet shortly after the 68-team bracket was unveiled Sunday, it had already earned the title of the tournament's most talked-about team.",
      "With six national championships, the Tar Heels are one of college basketball's most storied programs. But this was not one of their vintage seasons. At 22-13 they had produced one of the country's most polarizing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s because of their 1-12 record against the most valuable opponents on their schedule \u2014 what the NCAA calls \u201cQuadrant 1,\u201d which values beating highly rated teams, particularly on the road.",
      "North Carolina went 8-0 in \u201cQuad 2\u201d games and played a schedule ranked the nation\u2019s 25th-toughest, per ESPN ratings. Because North Carolina did not win the ACC Tournament, it did not earn an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament, and its fate rested on its worthiness in the estimation of the NCAA Tournament's selection committee.",
      "That committee is chaired by Bubba Cunningham, North Carolina's athletic director. And when North Carolina was selected Sunday as the last team to make the bracket, it instantly created controversy as teams such as West Virginia, Ohio State, Boise State and Indiana \u2014 among the first four left out \u2014 questioned what separated the Tar Heels.",

      "UCLA, South Carolina, Texas and USC claim top seeds in women's NCAA Tournament",
      "They were one of college basketball's worst teams. Now they own a historic turnaround and NCAA tournament dreams.",
      "Did North Carolina earn an advantage because its athletic director chaired the committee?",

      "Said Cunningham: \"I was not in the room for any of that.\"",
      "Gill said North Carolina won its spot after a \"contingency vote\" taken Saturday night that hinged on the outcome of Sunday's American Athletic Conference championship game between Memphis and UAB. A win by Memphis, the favorite, would have kept the conference at one bid, as expected, and allowed North Carolina to remain in. But had UAB won in an upset and earned an automatic berth, the AAC would have earned two berths \u2014 Memphis and UAB \u2014 and pushed out North Carolina.",
      "\"Memphis won, and that put North Carolina in the field,\" Gill said.",
      "The explanation did not stop debate over whether North Carolina deserved an at-large bid, nor did it stop discussion about the optics of the last team's having its athletic director chair the selection committee, despite the assurances that all policies for impartiality were followed. The athletic director at West Virginia called it a \"terrible tragedy\" that the Mountaineers were the first team left out, posting on X that \"our resume was better than several teams in the field.\"",
      "Against \"Quad 1\" competition, the first four teams left out all had favorable records compared with North Carolina. West Virginia was 6-10, Ohio State was 6-11, Indiana was 4-13, and Boise State was 3-6."

    "story": [
      "A doctor and professor was deported after she returned from a trip to Lebanon despite having a valid U.S. visa, according to a court petition filed on her behalf.",
      "Dr. Rasha Alawieh, an assistant professor at Brown Medicine, held an H-1B visa when she traveled to her home country to visit her family, according to the petition, which was filed in federal court by a cousin who learned of her situation.",
      "Court documents alleged that upon returning to the United States at the end of last week, she was held at Boston Logan International Airport for 36 hours before she was sent back to Lebanon this weekend in violation of a federal judge\u2019s order to halt her deportation.",
      "The initial petition Friday claimed that Customs and Border Protection had detained her \u201cwithout any justification,\u201d during which Alawieh had been uncontactable and unable to access legal counsel.",
      "\u201cCBP has refused to provide any information on the reason for her detention and expedited removal, nor to confirm the flight,\u201d the petition said.",
      "The same day, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ordered that Alawieh should not be removed from the state without 48 hours\u2019 notice and a reason in order to \u201cgive the Court time to consider the matter.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Alawieh confirmed that she is now back in Lebanon but declined to comment further.",
      "Customs and Border Protection said in an emailed statement, \u201cArriving aliens bear the burden of establishing admissibility to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur CBP Officers adhere to strict protocols to identify and stop threats, using rigorous screening, vetting, strong law enforcement partnerships, and keen inspectional skills to keep threats out of the country,\u201d Hilton Beckham, CBP\u2019s assistant commissioner of public affairs, said in the statement.",
      "A notice of court order violation filed Saturday said CBP \u201chad actual notice of this Court\u2019s order and willfully disobeyed this Court\u2019s order.\u201d It further requested an order to return Alawieh to Massachusetts immediately and to schedule an emergency hearing as soon as practicable.",
      "Alawieh, a Lebanese citizen, had been issued an H-1B visa for her employment at Brown Medicine, the petition said. She obtained her medical degree from the American University of Beirut in 2015 and completed her residency in 2018 at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Since she entered the United States on a J-1 visa in 2018, Alawieh went on to complete programs at Ohio State University, the University of Washington and the Yale Waterbury Internal Medicine Program before she started her assistant professorship at Brown.",
      "\u201cThe Division of Nephrology at Brown Medicine is extremely distressed at this treatment of their colleague,\u201d the court petition said. \u201cShe is an assistant professor and has serious responsibilities. Her colleagues have been covering for her, but that is no solution.\u201d",
      "Brown University spokesperson Brian Clark said in a statement that the university is \u201cseeking to learn more about what has happened, but we need to be careful about sharing information publicly about any individual\u2019s personal circumstances.\u201d",
      "The next hearing is scheduled for Monday morning."

      "Maximo Napa had set off for a fishing trip from Marcona, a town on the southern Peruvian coast, on December 7. He packed food for a two-week trip, but ten days in, stormy weather threw his boat off course and he ended up adrift in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "His family launched a search, but Peru\u2019s maritime patrols were unable to locate him until Wednesday, when an Ecuadorian fishing patrol discovered him some 680 miles off the country\u2019s coast, heavily dehydrated and in critical condition.",
      "\u201cI did not want to die,\u201d Napa told Reuters after reuniting with his brother, in Paita, near the border with Ecuador. \u201cI ate roaches, birds, the last thing I ate was turtles.\u201d",
      "He said he stayed strong thinking about his family, including his 2-month-old granddaughter, even as he survived on rainwater he collected on the boat and ran out of food, ultimately spending the last 15 days without eating.",
      "\u201cI thought about my mother every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to God for giving me a second chance.\"",

      "General Motors is recalling more than 90,000 vehicles over a transmission control valve issue that can cause tires to lock up, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.",
      "The problem affects cars with 10-speed transmissions, the safety administration said. Over time, the transmission control valves in some of the vehicles can become susceptible to excessive wear, causing a loss of pressure within the valve that can result in harsh shifting, it said.",
      "\u201cIn rare cases, the wheels may experience a momentary lock up,\" the administration said in a recall notice, increasing the risk of a crash.",
      "The affected models are the 2020-21 Cadillac CT4, 2020-21 Cadillac CT5, 2019-20 Cadillac CT6 and 2020-22 Chevrolet Camaro.",
      "Of the 90,081 cars potentially affected, 1% are estimated to have the defect, the NHTSA said.",
      "In September, the driver of a 2021 Cadillac CT5 reported the car's front tires locked up, the agency said.",
      "GM had previously looked into the issue, it said. Because the lock-ups generally lasted less than 150 milliseconds, the company determined that after no related accidents or injuries were reported, it wasn't enough time for the vehicle to lose control and closed the investigation, according to the safety administration.",
      "The probe was reopened in November, with a GM investigator finding 115 reports of lock-ups, with one leading to an accident, the NHTSA said.",
      "GM's Safety Field Action Decision Authority decided to conduct a safety recall on Feb. 27, the safety administration said.",
      "Affected owners will be notified starting next month and can get new transmission control software that will detect excessive safety valve wear and prevent wheel lock-ups."

      "One of the more intriguing two-seeds are the St. John\u2019s Red Storm, led by coach Rick Pitino. The Red Storm finished 30-4 in the regular season, including an 18-2 record in the Big East. Pitino has already led three teams to the Final Four and is the only coach to win national championships at two different schools. He can now add to both totals this spring.",
      "Duke, meanwhile, enters March Madness with a little bit of a question mark despite its seeding. The Blue Devils had to play the last two games of the ACC Tournament without star forward Cooper Flagg, who injured his left ankle during the conference tourney.",

      "As for teams more on the fringe, a controversial pick to take part in the First Four are the North Carolina Tar Heels. The Tar Heels were on the bubble but earned the chance to play for the 11th seed in the South.

      "The Tar Heels, Musketeers, Aztecs and Longhorns were the last four teams in, according to the NCAA.",
      "The first four schools that were left out were two Big Ten stalwarts, the Indiana Hoosiers and the Ohio State Buckeyes, and the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Boise State Broncos.",
      "The SEC will be well represented in the bracket, with a whopping 14 of its 16 teams making the 68-team field \u2014 an NCAA men\u2019s record for most bids by a single conference.",
      "Among the SEC\u2019s 14 selections are the Missouri Tigers, who made the tournament only one year after going 0-18 in conference play. The Tigers, who had three wins against top-five opponents in the regular season, could be a dangerous opponent.",
      "The first and second rounds of the tournament will run from Thursday through March 23, with the Sweet Sixteen and the Elite Eight taking place from March 27 through March 30.",
      "This year\u2019s men\u2019s Final Four will take place in San Antonio, beginning with the national semifinals on April 5 and the national championship game on April 7."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Trump administration officials Sunday announced the deportations of hundreds of immigrants the White House alleges are members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador under the wartime Alien Enemies Act after a judge temporarily blocked the effort Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe president invoked this authority to deport nearly 300 of them who are now in El Salvador, where they will be behind bars where they belong, rather than roaming freely in American communities,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance added in a post on X Sunday night that President Donald Trump deported \"violent criminals and rapists.\"",
      "It is not clear how the government determined the nearly 300 men were part of the gang or whether they had U.S. court hearings or immigration hearings, as the Alien Enemies Act allows the government to deport certain nationals in times of war without trial.",
      "A judge Saturday ordered any deportation flights that were carrying anyone subject to the presidential proclamation to return to the United States if they were currently in flight. The ruling, however, did not apply to migrants who had already landed in foreign countries before the court order or those subject to removal from the country for reasons separate from Trump's proclamation.",
      "The government said in a filing Sunday afternoon that \u201csome gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory\" before the court order was issued.",
      "It is unclear, however, whether any of the deportees had already landed in El Salvador before the judge\u2019s ruling or whether the Trump administration defied the order.",
      "Leavitt denied in a statement Sunday that the White House defied the court order and said the judge's ruling barring all deportation flights under Trump's proclamation was issued after \"terrorist [Tren De Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.\"",
      "\u201cThe written order and the Administration\u2019s actions do not conflict,\" Leavitt said. \"Moreover, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear \u2014 federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the President\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from U.S. soil and repel a declared invasion.\"",
      "Two senior Trump administration officials told NBC News they expect the court fight over the president\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to ultimately head to the Supreme Court, where they believe the administration will win.",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a rarely used authority, on Saturday in an effort to deport immigrants he alleged were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. But ahead of his proclamation, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit saying the administration was preparing to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelan men.",
      "A federal judge initially issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the administration from deporting the five men under the Alien Enemies Act and later blocked its use for deportations of all non-U.S. citizens who were in custody and subject to Trump\u2019s proclamation.",
      "\u201cAny plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\u201d\u00a0James\u00a0Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said Saturday. \u201cThose people need to be returned to the United States.\u201d",
      "Two flights holding Venezuelans were in transit during the judge\u2019s ruling, according to a source familiar with the matter. NBC News could not confirm whether the flights turned around following the order.",
      "A blue \u201cGlobal X\u201d plane took off from Harlingen, Texas, on Saturday afternoon, landing at El Salvador International Airport about an hour after the judge\u2019s ruling, according to an NBC News analysis of flight tracking databases. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video to X on Sunday that appeared to show several deportees being taken off of a blue \u201cGlobal X\u201d plane and taken into the custody of heavily armed Salvadoran authorities.",
      "NBC News cannot confirm whether the flights that landed in El Salvador carrying Venezuelans were the two flights that were in the air at the time of the judge\u2019s order.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer arguing the case for the ACLU, said Sunday that his team asked \u201cthe government to assure the court that nobody was removed\u201d in violation of the order. The government had not responded as of early afternoon, Gelernt said.",
      "Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said that if the administration is allowed to violate a court order with \u201cimpunity,\u201d the nation could barrel toward a constitutional crisis.",
      "\u201cNow that\u00a0Congress has shown itself subservient to the wishes of the White House, the judiciary is the last check against the exercise of autocratic power in the president,\u201d Gillers said. \u201cThe question before the country is whether the judges will use their contempt and other powers to resist the elimination of checks and balances in order to protect the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials touted the deportations Sunday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio thanked Bukele, saying in a statement that he \u201chas volunteered to imprison these violent criminals.\u201d Rubio said that \u201chundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country.\u201d",
      "Leavitt also praised the deportations on X, saying that \u201cthanks to the great work of the Department of State, these heinous monsters were extracted and removed to El Salvador where they will no longer be able to pose any threat to the American People.\u201d",
      "Neither Rubio\u2019s nor Leavitt\u2019s statements referred to the judge\u2019s order or detailed whether the administration was in compliance.",
      "Rubio also referred to wanting to \u201cget rid of Tren de Aragua members\u201d in an interview with CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "Asked about the arrest of activist Mahmoud Khalil and whether only people who express support for Palestinians could have their visas revoked, Rubio pointed to actions taken against Tren de Aragua.",
      "\u201cWe want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members. They\u2019re terrorists, too,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe president designated them \u2014 asked me to designate and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them, as well.\u201d",
      "Bukele said Sunday on X that 238 members of Tren de Aragua arrived in the country \u201ctoday.\u201d The United States also deported 23 MS-13 members to El Salvador, Bukele added. Also Sunday, Bukele posted an image of a headline about the judge\u2019s order, writing \u201cOopsie... Too late\u201d with a laughing emoji."

      "A Vatican official also confirmed on Sunday that his condition remains stable.",
      "\u201cThroughout the day, he continued his therapy, including motor and respiratory physiotherapy.

      "Last week, Francis surpassed four weeks of hospitalization just after marking the 12th anniversary of his election as the 266th pope.",
      "Earlier this month, Francis participated virtually in the Vatican\u2019s weeklong spiritual retreat, an annual gathering that kicks off the Catholic Church\u2019s solemn Lenten season leading to Easter. He joined via videoconference, where he was able to see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals in the Vatican auditorium couldn\u2019t see or hear him.",
      "Francis, who had part of one lung removed when he was young, was admitted on Feb. 14 as a result of a complex respiratory infection. What was initially a bad case of bronchitis progressed into a respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that threatened his life and raised concerns about the future of his papacy.",
      "But the pope has since been declared safe from the imminent danger of death, and he has been making gradual progress in his recovery. His latest medical bulletin noted that a chest X-ray confirmed improvements.",
      "Still, doctors have remained cautious about his overall fragility, saying that he needs to remain hospitalized for an unspecified number of days."

      "Schwarzenegger credits the hit HBO show\u2019s creator Mike White with how he shot and filmed the kissing scene to create a sense of unease among viewers.",
      "\u201cHe wants to leave that up to the interpretation of the audience of what is happening,\u201d Schwarzenegger says of White. \u201cWas a power shift happening? Is there a different power dynamic between him and Lochy? Is Lochy coming on to him? Is it the drugs? Is it the girls pressuring him? What is it? So, I think he leaves that open-ended for the audience to try to decipher.\u201d",
      "Schwarzenegger hints that the scene could signal that there is more to come for his character as the season progresses.",

      "\"And I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really relevant and prevalent for for Saxon. Him walking into the White Lotus as the most confident and sure person of who he is, and everything gets completely questioned in his experience there,\" he adds.",
      "The startling kiss between the brothers comes after a long day of partying. After an epic time on Greg\u2019s yacht, Saxon and Lochlan stay behind with Greg\u2019s girlfriend Chloe and her pal Chelsea to go to the Full Moon Party on a nearby island.",

      "Jaclyn brings him back inside and they hook up. It's in a shocking act of betrayal, since she'd been the one telling Laurie to hook up with Valentin in the wake of her divorce.",

      "After sharing how much pressure he's under, she returns back to bed and Tim starts to pray, asking God to tell him what to do.",
      "In Bangkok, Rick meets with a friend (played by Sam Rockwell) who gives him a bag with what seems to be a gun inside as they prepare to meet with the hotel owner's husband, whom Rick says killed his father before he was born.",

      "\"The Electric State,\" which premiered on Netflix on March 14, takes a new spin on the age-old tale of robots taking over.",
      "This time, robots lose the war and are an oppressed class.",
      "To understand the film, which was inspired by a 2018 graphic novel, you need to understand the world's history. Humans invented robots and put them to work doing manual labor and service jobs. Eventually, the robots rebelled and started the Robots Rights' Movement, led by a robot version of Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson). During the Clinton Administration, a deadly war broke out between the humans and the robots.",
      "Technology mogul Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci) developed Neurocasters, a technology one puts on their head (like VR) which links the human mind to mechanized drone bodies. Neurocasters split your consciousness, a la \"Severance.\" One version of a human can be in a drone body working, while the other version is having fun in the human's original body.",
      "Once humans developed this new technology, they defeated the Robot Equality Coalition, banishing all the robots to Sentre's Exclusion Zone (known as The EX).",
      "Stanley Tucci explained on TODAY March 12 that Neurocasters were \u201coriginally sort of designed to sort of ease people\u2019s pain and suffering, but it\u2019s gotten out of hand.\u201d",
      "\"The Electric State,\" directed by the Russo brothers, takes place in the aftermath of this war in 1994, following Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown) as she races across the country to find her genius brother, Christopher, whom she had previously thought died in a car crash along with their parents.",
      "Accompanying her is a robot named Cosmo (Alan Tudyk). Although he can not fully speak, Cosmo conveys that Christopher is alive and projecting his own consciousness into Cosmo.",
      "Eventually, she teams up with Keats (Chris Pratt) and his own robot friend Herman (Anthony Mackie). Together, the foursome journeys through The EX to find Christopher.",
      "Along the way, they find Dr. Amherst (Ke Huy Quan) who informs them that Christopher is actually the reason that the Neurocasters exist. In fact, Christopher's brain is such a marvel, that in his comatose state after the car accident, his brain was strong enough to power \u2014 and still powers \u2014 all of Sentre's (Ethan Skate's company) technology.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many elements of animation, it\u2019s a massive, epic scope and scale, but really rooted in humanity,\u201d Chris Pratt said on TODAY Oct. 17. \u201cAnd that relationship between these two folks is a big part of that.\u201d",
      "Throughout the film, Michelle befriends many more robots who are voiced by big names like Woody Harrelson, Jenny Slate, Brian Cox and Hank Azaria.",
      "All the while she's on the run from Col. Bradbury (Giancarlo Esposito), a leader in the uprising and now a bounty hunter catching robots (Coleman Domingo also makes a cameo here as a soldier within Bradbury's ranks).",
      "The sci-fi/adventure film ends similar to how the world's history began: a huge battle between humans and robots, but this time the viewer is rooting for the robots. Read on the understand why and what happens.",
      "'The Electric State' ending explained",
      "During a battle in The EX, Col. Bradbury successfully kidnaps Cosmo. He gets ready to fly him back to Sentre when the drone that Ethan is Neurocasting into kills Dr. Amherst. Col. Bradbury still brings Cosmo back to Sentre, but face-to-face, he tells Ethan that he's crossed a line by killing someone and lying to him.",
      "Ethan doesn't care as he has Christopher's essence back, meaning his company won't completely crumble and instead is back at functioning capacity.",
      "This is when Michelle, her friends and a bunch of robots from The EX begin their attack on Sentre's headquarters with the mission of freeing Christopher.",
      "Amherst's computer, which stores all his knowledge, had revealed that removing Christopher's brain from the system would free him and cause a complete system failure for Sentre.",
      "Keats and Herman start the first wave of the attack, launching cars into Sentre's headquarters. Ethan deploys his entire security squad to stop their attack. Michelle, meanwhile, sneaks into Sentre through a backdoor using the code she'd secured.",
      "The second wave of robots then attack Sentre, coming to Keats and Herman's aid and launching a full on war against Ethan's security forces, who are Neurocasting into drones.",
      "Michelle reaches the room holding Christopher. She discovers that she has to put on a Neurocaster and go inside Christopher's mind to speak to him.",
      "While inside, Christopher confirms that if his brain is removed from the system, Sentre dies \u2014 but his physical body cannot survive without Sentre. He tells Michelle that she needs to be the one to save the world from Sentre, meaning that she must kill her own brother.",
      "While Michelle grapples with this realization, unsure of what to do, Ethan fires up his own Neurocaster, which is connected to a giant, lethal drone. He steps into battle in the suit and immediately begins destroying the robots.",
      "Separately on the battle field, Col. Bradbury confronts Mr. Peanut, but instead of fighting him as he had the entire film, he admits he was wrong and tells Mr. Peanut what room and floor Ethan's real body is located on. Col. Bradbury then exits the battle.",
      "Keats and Herman fight Ethan in his drone suit. They defeat him, but Herman dies in the process. As the real Ethan is taking his Neurocaster off, he's confronted by Mr. Peanut inside Sentre to renegotiate the treaty.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelle is still talking to Christopher, unwilling to let him die. Then he tells her that Sentre has put tighter controls over him this time and he doesn't want to live like this forever. Sentre could keep him alive for 100 years. Michelle sayas she doesn't want to lose him again.",
      "\"You can't lose me,\" Christopher tells her. \"But you can lose them. You. You're the one whose gonna change the world.\"",
      "After a final cry, hug, and exchanging of \"I love you's,\" Michelle leaves, pressing three buttons that kill her younger brother. She holds Cosmo's hand and Christopher's chest in both her hands.",
      "The timing is impeccable as Keats is about to be killed by a drone, but all of Sentre's technology ceases to work before the fatal strike.",
      "Despite Christopher dying, there's a happiness to the battle as Herman emerges alive and well after Keats bears his soul to what he believed to be his lifeless friend.",
      "What follows is a montage of Sentre shutting down across the world and news emerging that the company had been experimenting on a little boy to stay afloat. Ethan Skate gets arrested in the aftermath. The media montage ends with a reporter saying, \"You know who I want to talk about? The girl who trucked a ton of bots to Seattle to kick Skate's butt.\"",
      "Cut to Michelle, who films a video for the world saying that the technology Sentre made was bad for everyone, not just robots.",
      "\"I know the war happened and things fell apart and life really sucked,\" she says. \"And maybe for a little while the Neurocasters helped you forget that. We got so used to it that we thought that\u2019s what real life was. But it\u2019s not. Real life, it\u2019s contact. It\u2019s you and me. We\u2019re flesh and bone, yeah, but we\u2019re also electricity. And when we hug and laugh and hold hands and argue, my particles stay with you and yours stay with me. And maybe we stay together forever. But that can\u2019t happen if you close yourself off.\"",
      "Michelle continues on, saying humanity needs to start over. She tells everyone that they need to stick together and help each other to make it work.",
      "\"Look around,\" she says. \"There\u2019s someone near you right now. They\u2019re real and alive. And they need you as much as you need them. And if there isn\u2019t, if you don\u2019t have anyone, then come find us. Because we\u2019re starting over. We\u2019re going to do it right this time.\u201d",
      "What does that last scene mean? Is Christopher alive?",
      "With Michelle saving the world like Christopher had instructed her to do, the movie could end \u2014\u00a0but instead it tacks on one last scene.",
      "Cosmo, the robot Christopher had transferred some of his essence into, is dumped into what looks to be a pile of trash. Nearby, a stray dog laps water from a puddle.",
      "The final shot shows the reflection in the water as Cosmo rises up, hinting that some of Christopher's essence may still be alive within him."

      "Meanwhile, brother-in-law Chris Pratt had \"a really funny line\" in which he joked, \"he's not blood related, so he was looking where he wanted,\" Schwarzenegger recalled, referencing Pratt's interview with \"E! News\" last month. (\"I know where my eyes went \u2014 I\u2019m not blood related to him, I was looking at that d---, bro,\" Pratt had said.)",
      "Schwarzenegger says that his family hasn't set any rules for watching the NSFW scenes together \u2014 although with what he knows is coming up on the show, he says he might not be so keen to watch future episodes with them.",
      "\"There's no rules,\" he says. \"But I probably will take a hiatus from watching with them for the next couple episodes.\"",
      "In Episode 1, Schwarzenegger's character, Saxon, sleeps naked next to his younger brother, Lochlan (Sam Nivola), but Schwarzenegger says it wasn't initially written into the script.",
      "In fact, Schwarzenegger revealed on TODAY on March 13 that he suggested the idea to show creator Mike White.",
      "\"I was supposed to be in pajamas, but I thought it was very real for Saxon, for the character, to be naked,\" he said. \"It was a power play and it's very much this character. Mike thought it was hilarious and it played into the next scene perfectly, and I think it caused a stir online.\"",
      "Schwarzenegger tells TODAY.com that he hopes people don\u2019t conflate who he is as a person with his character, whom he describes as a \u201cweird and creepy kind of guy.\u201d",
      "He says that after the nude scene in Episode 1 came out, someone asked him, \"Dude, you really like that with your brother?\"",
      "Schwarzenegger, who has two sisters, a brother and a half-brother, replied, \"No!\"",
      "\"But, you also can't control what everybody thinks,\" he says.",
      "Even still, Schwarzenegger says that for Saxon, a Southern finance bro, his most \"pivotal (moments) are yet to come.\"",
      "Schwarzenegger was hesitant to give too much away about future episodes, but he hints that his character is forced to confront who he is throughout the rest of the season.",
      "\"One of the themes is kind of you enter the White Lotus as one person, and you leave as another,\" he says. \"Who are you when everything that you thought you were is taken away?\"",
      "\"And I think that that's something that's really relevant and prevalent for Saxon, and of really dealing with him walking into he White Lotus as the most confident and sure person of who he is,\" he continues. \"And everything gets completely questioned in his experience there.\"",
      "Schwarzenegger is even keeping secrets of how the show pans out from his fianc\u00e9e. But she tries to get him to spill by sharing fan theories from TikTok and Reddit and gauging his reaction, he says.",
      "\"She brings up the ones that she finds the most interesting and then she tells me them,\" he says. \"And she tries to get a reaction out of me, but I try to keep a pretty neutral tone.\"",
      "On TODAY, Schwarzenegger said that some of Champion's favorite theories stem from the ones that believe that the Ratliffs are based off the real-life Peterson family, whose story was fictionalized in the HBO series \"The Staircase.\"",
      "\"I did another show with Parker Posey, actually, called \u2018The Staircase,\u2019 and our family in that show is also from Durham, North Carolina,\" he said, noting the similarities to the Ratliff family on \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of crossover, synergy there,\" he added. \"So Abby's been very hooked on the theories of 'The Staircase' meeting 'White Lotus.'\"",
      "Whether the Ratliffs meet a similar fate as the Petersons still remains to be seen. New episodes of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d air Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO and are also available to stream on Max."

      "On \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show,\u201d Blanchett recalled her 1997 nuptials to the screenwriter and revealed why they only have one \"blurry\" photo from their wedding day.",
      "\"When we got married, we had absolutely no money. We couldn't have a photographer and we had two friends who were photographers,\" she said.",
      "\"One guy got so drunk he forgot to load film in the camera and the other one had such a good time that he didn\u2019t take any pictures, and as a result, we have one picture of our wedding. All we have is a blurry picture of the two of us getting in the car.\"",

      "\u201cHe thought I was aloof and I thought he was arrogant,\" she said. \"And it just shows how wrong you can be. But once he kissed me, that was that.\u201d",

      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Black Bag.\"",
      "\"Black Bag,\" which hits theaters March 14, has all the themes a compelling spy thriller should: secrets, love, betrayal and, of course, some killer outfits (no pun intended).",
      "Directed by Stephen Soderbergh, the film follows George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender) as he tries to find a mole within his own agency \u2014 the National Cyber Security Center in London.",
      "Unfortunately for him, the prime suspect seems to be his wife Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett) who also works at the NCSC.",
      "At issue is a secretive software program called Severus, which has been stolen from the NCSC by a mole within the agency. Apparently, the mole is working on a sale with terrorists to give them Severus, which would cause the death of thousands and topple current global power balances. George has one week to figure out who the mole is.",
      "George, who is known for his interrogation skills with a lie detector, spends the film investigating agents who could be possible moles: recently promoted young star Col. James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page), lothario Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke), Freddie's girlfriend and technology expert Clarissa Dubose (Marisa Abela) and therapist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris), who is dating James.",
      "George, who turned his own father in for wrongdoing in the past, also secretly investigates Kathryn as the clues continue to point towards her. This, however, proves to be a testament to his love.",
      "\"I watch her, I assume she watches me. If she's in trouble, even of her own making, I will do everything in my power to extricate her,\" George says in the film.",
      "Yet as he continues to investigate Kathryn, she answers too many of his questions with two simple words: \"Black bag.\"",
      "For those who need a spy lingo refresh, \u201cblack bag\u201d is a term used to convey that an operation or a piece of information is top secret and the speaker cannot say more.",
      "\"It comes from the tradition of spies putting their documents into a black bag and once that black bag is locked, no one can know what's in it,\" Cate Blanchett told TODAY on March 10. \"So in order for their marriage to function, when they go on separate operations, when they ask one another details, they say 'Sorry, black bag.'\"",
      "After many twists and turns, the traitorous reveal of who the mole truly is comes amid of a flurry of chaos and confusion.",
      "Here's the final dinner party scene broken down and all your questions answered.",
      "'Black Bag' ending explained",
      "For a spy movie, \"Black Bag\" had very few physical action scenes, instead relying on psychologically thrilling turns of events to propel the plot.",
      "As Reg\u00e9-Jean Page told TODAY on March 7, it's a \"super taut psychological thriller.\"",
      "Two of the most tense scenes in the film are dinner parties hosted by George and Kathryn with all the potential moles invited \u2014 which Blanchett described on TODAY as \"quite theatrical\" scenes.",
      "While the first dinner party included a nice meal (dosed with a narcotic that functioned as truth serum, of course) and a side of dramatics (like a hand stabbing), the second dinner party skipped the meal all together, cutting straight to the chase: a game.",
      "George sets a gun on the table, announcing that everyone will play a game as Dr. Vaughan realizes that the couple has changed their carpet to easily dispose of a body if needed.",
      "In typical George fashion, this game will be potentially deadly and meant to expose plenty of secrets. Through careful questions and accusations, George gets everyone to admit to something.",
      "Dr. Vaughan has been secretly sleeping with Freddie as she thought she might need something from him. During this affair, Freddie told her about the cameras being redirected \u2014 which was one of the biggest clues that pointed towards Kathryn being the mole.",
      "However, going into the dinner party, George has already discovered that someone within the agency is framing Kathryn.",
      "The big reveal comes when it's discovered that it wasn't terrorists who initiated the idea to steal Severus, it was an agency worker.",
      "James has been the one working to sell Severus. James did so by putting the program on a hard drive that he stored in a red soccer ball keychain which he\u2019d been seen with throughout the film. James reveals that his boss Arthur Stieglitz (Pierce Brosnan) was the one who suggested the idea.",
      "But then the second twist happens. There were two plans running amok during the movie. James had one plan, while Freddie had another.",
      "James worked to sell Severus to the terrorists, while separately  Freddie was trying to frame George and Kathryn for the crime.",
      "George then reveals photos of James selling Severus. With no way out, James grabs the gun from the middle of the table and says he did it to end the war. He also admits to killing Philip Meacham, an agent and friend of George who was murdered earlier, to cover up his crimes.",
      "James then points the gun at George, narrowing in on his target. But George doesn't flinch. Instead he says that a camera has been filming them this whole time.",
      "But this fact doesn't deter James. He tries to shoot George, but the gun doesn't work. Before James can do anything else, Kathryn pulls a second gun out and shoots James in the head, immediately killing him.",
      "This action proves a point George and Kathryn had been reciting to each other the whole film: they would kill for each other. Blanchett echoed that point on TODAY, telling Savannah Guthrie they would \"literally kill for each other.\"",
      "The rest of the film ties up loose ends smoothly. The couple wraps James' body into the new carpet they'd placed beneath the table. George then dumps James' body into the secluded lake he goes fishing in.",
      "The film then flashes forward to Monday at work. Kathryn tells Arthur that he needs to step away from his position.",
      "He tells her he will leave his job \"feet first,\" to which she responds, \"Anyway you like.\"",
      "There's just one lose end to wrap up by this point. Where did the 7 million pounds go that was transferred about throughout all the chaos?",
      "Well, during a passionate makeout scene, George tells Kathryn the money is in a Swiss bank account that they have access to.",
      "The end leaves viewers with George and Kathryn kissing, perhaps paying homage to the film's message: it's more than just a spy movie. It's a tale about the mysteries of marriage and the lengths of love."

      "\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d alum Doug Kiker, who auditioned on Season 18 of the singing competition show, has died, his sister confirmed. He was 32.",
      "On March 12, Kiker\u2019s sister, Angela Evans, posted a statement on Facebook about his death. She uploaded two pictures of her brother and wrote, \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we have to announce the passing of my brother Douglas Kiker.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was sooo loved and will be missed by so many! (You\u2019re) singing with the Angel\u2019s now Bubba,\u201d she added. \u201cPlease pray for our family as we go (through) this very difficult time.\u201d",
      "Her post tagged Kiker\u2019s account, which said that he resided in Mobile, Alabama. She did not provide more information about his cause of death.",
      "Kiker appeared as the first contestant on Season 18 of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in 2020. He was featured in the premiere, which aired Feb. 16, 2020, and sang Rascal Flatts\u2019 \u201cBless the Broken Road.\u201d Kiker, then 27, was working as a garbage collector when he decided to pursue a singing career despite a lack of experience. He also mentioned that he had a 2-year-old daughter at the time.",
      "After he belted out the lyrics to the country song, Perry and Kiker became emotional. Host Ryan Seacrest, Perry and fellow judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan all announced together that Kiker earned a ticket to Hollywood and would continue to the next round.",
      "They hugged Kiker and Perry told him, \u201cListen, you just stay who you are and you\u2019re going to go so far. And you\u2019re going to take your daughter with you to all the highest heights.\u201d",
      "Kiker was eliminated before making it into the Top 20. But, he later returned to perform his audition song again, this time with Rascal Flatts, during the finale. He sang along with the trio for a virtual performance due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Prior to the finale, Kiker made another appearance on the show during a \u201cHome Check-In\u201d segment that Bryan posted on Instagram.",
      "In the clip, Kiker said, \u201cY\u2019all notice anything different about me? I got new teeth, guys.\u201d",
      "He showed off his new smile and continued, \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit, man. Y\u2019all got me feeling that way. I finally believe in myself enough to actually sing in front of people. I\u2019m about to go do somebody\u2019s birthday party. I\u2019m going to video-chat them due to the COVID-19.\u201d",
      "Kiker\u2019s daughter then sat on his lap as he told her, \u201cI did this for you.\u201d",
      "In the caption, Bryan wrote, \u201c@douglaskiker looking good y\u2019all. Thankful we met you buddy.\u201d",
      "Kiker regularly uploaded videos of him singing to the Instagram account that Bryan tagged. His last post was shared on Dec. 5, 2022.",
      "In May 2021, about a year after his stint on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Kiker was arrested and charged with third-degree domestic violence, or harassment, documents obtained by TODAY.com confirmed."

    "story": [
      "Nicholas Baxter\u2019s usual moral balance involves the scales of justice at work in the district attorney\u2019s office each week, but what happens when that delicate equilibrium tips over into his life at home?",
      "It means things get \u201cfun and kind of messy,\u201d according to Tony Goldwyn, who has portrayed DA Baxter on \u201cLaw & Order\u201d since the character\u2019s introduction in March 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those episodes of \u2018Law & Order\u2019 that has a lot of dimension to it,\u201d he explains in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "In the March 13 episode, \u201cCrossing Lines,\u201d James Powers, the son of a senator, is found dead. Julia Gallow, a journalist working on a hit piece about Powers, quickly draws suspicion. Baxter recuses himself from the case after the defense attorney he\u2019s dating, Kate Norris (Maggie Siff), signs on to represent Gallow.",
      "Baxter tells Executive Assistant District Attorney Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) to run point for the prosecution since he has to sit this one out.",
      "\u201cI especially thought this episode was so well done,\u201d Goldwyn says. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice because the cases are always interesting on \u2018Law & Order,\u2019 but to be able to bring in our personal lives and to discover more about the characters, it just makes it more interesting to play and explore.\u201d",
      "He also appreciates getting to work with \u201camazing co-stars like Maggie Siff.\u201d",
      "Goldwyn says he thought what was \u201cparticularly skillful about this episode\u201d was it \u201cvery much integrated\u201d Baxter\u2019s personal life into \u201cthe story of the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs opposed to something that would just be sort of tacked on as a, you know, a moment with Baxter outside of work, which is less interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis I thought was really cool because the case impacts the relationship in a really great way.\u201d",
      "What happens between Baxter and his girlfriend during the case on \u2018Law & Order\u2019?",
      "Lt. Jessica Brady (Maura Tierney) goes over to Baxter\u2019s place after police find the DA's business card in a victim's pocket. Baxter identifies the deceased as Powers, whom he says he ran into that morning. Then, his girlfriend enters the room.",
      "\u201cThat your new friend, Kate?\u201d Brady asks, continuing a playful exchange she had with Baxter in the last episode after seeing a bottle of wine he got from \u201cKate.\u201d",
      "Baxter confirms, and Brady responds, \u201cHm, punching above your weight.\u201d",
      "Tierney joined the cast this season, and Goldwyn says he was \u201cvery excited to work with her.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s sort of developing, in a subtle way, this kind of really interesting character with Brady,\u201d he explains, \u201cand similar to what we\u2019re saying about sort of our personal lives, you\u2019re getting a sense of a relationship developing between Baxter and Brady, which has a real sense of humor to it. They can kind of bust on each other. It takes away any kind of generic quality that can sometimes happen with procedural shows where you\u2019re just so focused on the plot.\u201d",
      "During another scene at home, Baxter and Kate have to cut their chat about the case short because Kate says the defendant, Gallow, reached out asking if she could represent her in court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m actually feeling really excited about it,\u201d Kate tells Baxter.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m feeling really excited,\u201d Baxter responds, before they kiss each other goodbye.",
      "\u201cI was excited to work with her, and she\u2019s, I thought, so good in this episode,\u201d Goldwyn says of Siff, who\u2019s more recently known for her work on \u201cBillions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had great kind of chemistry,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo, it\u2019s nice.\u201d",
      "Baxter then takes Price to a diner to tell him he\u2019s dating Kate, whom he says he\u2019s known since their time together at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Baxter reveals he will recuse himself but not the entire office.",
      "\u201cI recognize this puts you in an awkward position, so I don\u2019t want you and (ADA) Sam (Maroun) to feel any added pressure. Just treat this like any other case, and treat Kate like any other defense attorney,\u201d Baxter tells him.",
      "\u201cYeah, easier said than done,\u201d Price responds with an awkward laugh.",
      "Goldwyn credits showrunner Rick Eid for building the relationship between Price and his new superior.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tension between Price and Baxter,\u201d Goldwyn explains. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite sure how they felt about each other. And now, you get these sort of back-and-forth glimpses of a real respect and connection between them.\u201d",
      "While \u201cperiodically, it goes a little south,\u201d Goldwyn says, he enjoys the back and forth and \u201cnot feeling obliged to explain that too much.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I really like that little scene we have in the diner,\u201d he adds, \u201cwhere I just tell him, \u2018I\u2019m not going to give this to another prosecutor,\u2019 which indicates that Baxter has a lot of respect for Price.\u201d",
      "Over dinner at home one night, Kate brings up the case, and Baxter tries to shut down the conversation, as they agreed not to talk about it.",
      "Kate asks Baxter to let her client plead down to a lesser charge.",
      "Baxter tells her to talk to Price, and Kate says Price \u201cisn\u2019t willing to negotiate.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Baxter says. \u201cDon\u2019t go over Nolan\u2019s head, and don\u2019t try to play me against him.\u201d",
      "Then Baxter gets a message and meets Price, who informs him Kate threatened their eyewitness and got him to recant.",
      "Baxter returns home and confronts Kate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still going to win, Kate, despite what you did,\u201d he tells her.",
      "Goldwyn says Kate puts his character in a \u201cvery tough spot\u201d during \u201ca tough time.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe found this substantial woman \u2026 this thing might work. They really connected with each other, and she screws it up,\u201d he says. \u201cShe crosses the line, and I think it really upsets him.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, when we have the beginning of that fight, and I kind of shut her down, and then Nolan calls, and I go down to his car \u2026 and he mentions the case, and I snap at him, saying, \u2018I told you I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019 And I\u2019ve just been upstairs talking to my girlfriend about it. That\u2019s the kind of thing about where you get into the relationship dynamics that make it fun and kind of messy.\u201d",
      "Does Nicholas Baxter still have a girlfriend on \u2018Law & Order\u2019?",
      "Baxter ends up being right \u2014 his team does win, and Kate\u2019s client is found guilty.",
      "The final scene of the episode shows Baxter and Kate outside the courtroom after the jury reads the verdict.",
      "\u201cIt was a tough case,\u201d Baxter says to Kate. \u201cYou did what you could.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she responds. \u201cI did.\u201d",
      "Then Kate walks away leaving Baxter alone.",
      "So, are they still together?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldwyn says coyly. \u201cI kind of hope so. That\u2019s above my pay grade.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like the ambiguity of it,\u201d he adds.",
      "But \u201cthere's definitely a problem,\u201d he confirms.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to mix business and personal relationships in that way,\u201d he continues.",
      "Baxter and his wife separated at the end of last season after their daughter was a witness in a case against his wife\u2019s wishes.",
      "\u201cIt felt not good for a guy who\u2019s going through a divorce \u2026 and his work got in the way of his marriage and his family,\u201d Goldwyn explains. \u201cAnd that was obviously quite painful. So now, here we go again.\u201d",
      "He adds he feels his character \u201clikes being involved with smart, dynamic, powerful women.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s also very dedicated to his work,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel bad for him.\u201d",

      "\"I am grateful that the intelligence data matched today, and we discussed that the Ukrainian side has a presence in the territory of Kursk Oblast, and that the encirclement of Ukrainian troops is a lie from Putin,\" he said at a press conference Saturday. \"There is no encirclement of Ukrainian troops in the territory of Kursk Oblast.\"",

      "Ukrainian troops seized the area inside Russia, just over Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, last year in an audacious move that embarrassed Moscow. But losing control of the Kursk region would be a blow for Kyiv, as the Ukrainian government has viewed the territory as valuable leverage in any future peace talks.",
      "President Donald Trump said Friday on Truth Social that \"thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded,\" and that he had asked Putin not to attack them.",
      "Over the past 11 days, Russian forces stepped up ground and air attacks on the Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region from multiple directions, two Western officials and a military analyst said.",

      "\u201cThey have had the capability to retake the salient for a couple of months, probably. But we have really not seen an effort to prioritize it until the last week or so,\u201d she said.",
      "Over two days, Russia dropped several three-ton FAB-3000 bombs against Ukrainian targets in Kursk that it rarely employs on the front line, according to Evans. The Russians use guidance kits to convert large free-fall bombs into guided glide bombs that can be launched from outside the range of most of Ukraine\u2019s air defense systems.",
      "Ukraine denied that its troops were surrounded in Kursk or in danger of encirclement.",
      "\u201cReports of the alleged \u2018encirclement\u2019 of Ukrainian units by the enemy in the Kursk region are false and fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s general staff said in a statement Friday.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s incursion into Russia in August marked the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since World War II.",
      "As Ukrainian troops came under pressure in Kursk, President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Putin in Moscow on Thursday to try to advance a proposed ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesperson said afterward that there were \u201creasons to be cautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for ending the war.",

      "Putin appeared to be trying to complicate the negotiations to buy time for Russian forces as they advance in Kursk, the European official said.",
      "Referring to the Ukrainians in Kursk, Putin asked what will happen to the troops if a ceasefire is agreed. \u201cWill all those who are there come out without a fight? Or will the Ukrainian leadership order them to lay down arms and surrender?\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump may be pushing Americans further apart, but he\u2019s brought Canadians closer together.",
      "In a dynamic likely to be familiar to Americans, Canada had become increasingly polarized in recent years, with voters poised to replace the longtime Liberal government with a Conservative Party capitalizing on their worries about inflation and immigration.",
      "But since Trump returned to office, Canadians\u2019 top concern has shifted to relations with the United States, as he imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian imports and made joking-but-maybe-not comments about making their country the 51st U.S. state.",
      "The steady flow of threats and insults from Trump has shocked and confused Canadians, completely upended their upcoming election and inspired a newfound patriotism in a country that isn\u2019t known for being showy about that kind of thing.",
      "It\u2019s been a head-spinning turn of events for those who are struggling to understand how the U.S. could turn on Canada so quickly.",
      "\u201cThe degree of disappointment and disillusionment is very high,\u201d said Jonathan Malloy, a political science professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, the Canadian capital.",
      "There is also intense anger. The country is ringing with calls to \u201cBuy Canadian,\u201d with U.S. liquor pulled from shelves and Canadian products prominently marked with maple leaf signs in grocery stores. Canadians are booing the U.S. national anthem at hockey games, canceling trips to the U.S. and asking for \u201cCanadianos\u201d instead of Americanos at coffee shops."

      "Once rare, Israel's use of airstrikes in the occupied West Bank has soared since Oct. 7, 2023, stoking fears that it is deploying the military tactics there that it used in the Gaza Strip, some 60 miles away.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a time in the history of the occupation, not even during the Second Intifada, that the use of airstrikes had become so severe and deadly,\u201d in the West Bank, Shai Parnes, spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem, told NBC News, referring to the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.",
      "However, by B\u2019Tselem\u2019s count, since Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli military has increasingly dropped bombs on the territory: at least 69 airstrikes in the West Bank killed 261 people, including 41 under the age of 19. At least 28 of those 261 people have been killed since Jan. 19, Parnes said.",
      "The rise in airstrikes, according to a report published by B'Tselem on Wednesday, speaks to the increasingly destructive path that human rights groups say Israel has taken in the West Bank, with its operations accelerating since the Jan. 19 ceasefire in Gaza."
