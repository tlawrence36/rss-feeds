      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

She sold illustrated fan cards of HUNTR/X and Saja Boys at her booth at the Los Angeles Anime Expo, held in July, two weeks after the movie was released on Netflix.",
      "And she wasn\u2019t the only one. A search of #kpopdemonhunters on Instagram yields thousands of fan illustrations of HUNTR/X and Saja Boys.",
      "Japan-based Youtuber Emily Sim, also known as Emirichu online, says the character designs and original plot drew her to the movie. Sim, with more than 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube, posted a 35-minute video about the movie. In a week-and-a-half, it garnered nearly 450,000 views.",
      "\u201cI love seeing all the fan art and just the ways that this movie has creatively inspired people,\u201d Sim said.",
      "Kang says for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d her team wanted to bring together demons and Jeoseung Saja \u2014 the grim reaper in Korean mythology \u2014 for a film that could look both very traditional and modernized \u2014 what she says is common in K-dramas but not in animation.",
      "Herman compares the movie to another Sony animation: \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which also attracted a broad audience with its creative animation. \u201cAnd it's a fun, animated musical, which we haven't had in a while,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.\u201d",
      "Santiago was initially skeptical of the title \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. They kind of like to take advantage of K-pop fans\u2019 sincerity,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cBut I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.\u201d",
      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",
      "Herman agrees, and says that the film has in-jokes for K-pop fans, not unlike a children's movie that features some humor meant to appeal specifically to parents.",
      "\u201cFiguring out what makes K-pop tick in a way that resonates with musical fans was really important to this movie,\u201d said Herman.",
      "For Kang, that was always at the heart of the project. \u201cFandom plays a huge part in the world being saved at the end of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we were really confident that we were doing that justice.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",

We have a chance to celebrate them, complete them, tell them, view them and share them with an audience. It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",

She\u2019s especially excited for attendees to experience a range of conversations, from little-known moments in Black history to a panel on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Oak Bluffs collection with Morehouse and Spelman.",

      "Tens of thousands of Deadheads are pouring into San Francisco for three days of Dead & Company concerts in honor of the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Fans of the Grateful Dead are pouring into San Francisco for three days of concerts and festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the scruffy jam band that came to embody a city where people wore flowers in their hair and made love, not war.",
      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",
      "But Deadhead David Aberdeen is thrilled anyway.",
      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cThere are 18-year-olds who were obviously not even a twinkle in somebody\u2019s eyes when Jerry died, and these 18-year-olds get the values of Deadheads,\u201d said former Grateful Dead publicist and author Dennis McNally.",
      "Deadheads can reel off why and how, and the moment they fell in love with the music. Fans love that no two shows are the same; the band plays different songs each time. They also embrace the community that comes with a Dead show.",
      "Sunshine Powers didn\u2019t have friends until age 13, when she stepped off a city bus and into the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.",
      "\u201cI, all of a sudden, felt like I fit in. Or like I didn\u2019t have to fit in,\u201d says Powers, now 45 and the owner of tie-dye emporium Love on Haight. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one it was, but I know it was like, OK.\"",
      "Similarly, her friend Taylor Swope, 47, survived a tough freshman year at a new school with the help of a Grateful Dead mixtape. The owner of the Little Hippie gift shop is driving from Brooklyn, New York, to sell merchandise, reconnect with friends and see the shows.",
      "\u201cThe sense of, \u2018I found my people, I didn\u2019t fit in anywhere else and then I found this, and I felt at home.\u2019 So that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d she said of the allure.",
      "Sometimes, becoming a Deadhead is a process.",
      "Thor Cromer, 60, had attended several Dead shows, but was ambivalent about the hippies. That changed on March 15, 1990, in Landover, Maryland.",

Besides Garcia, founding members Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan on keyboards died in 1973 and bassist Phil Lesh died last year at age 84.",

    "story": [
      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

      "The box office success of \u201cFirst Steps\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d means \u201cthe whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it\u2019s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission.",
      "The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh.",
      "The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed\u2019s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue\u2019s diplomacy has led to global peace.",
      "Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats.",
      "The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the \u201cAvengers\u201d-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. \u201cThunderbolts,\" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally.",
      "Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets in 2019.",
      "The \u201cFantastic Four's\u201d opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August.",
      "Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy \u201cOh, Hi!\u201d earned $1.1 million from 866 screens.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by \u201cF1\u201d with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. \u201cSmurfs\u201d rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend.",

      "Rahbani, also known as a political provocateur, died Saturday at age 69. The cause of death was not immediately known.",
      "His passing shocked much of the Arab world, which appreciated his satire, unapologetic political critique and avante-garde, jazz-inspired compositions that mirrored the chaos and contradictions of Lebanon throughout its civil war from 1975 until 1990. He also composed some of his mother's most famous songs.",
      "The Rahbani family was a cornerstone in Lebanon's golden era of music theater that today is steeped in idealism and nostalgia in a troubled country.",
      "Top Lebanese political officials and artists paid tribute after the death was announced. Rahbani, a leftist Greek Orthodox, often mocked Lebanon\u2019s sectarian divisions in his work.",
      "Hundreds of people holding roses and photos gathered by Khoury Hospital near Beirut's busy Hamra district, solemnly singing some of his most famous songs and applauding as a vehicle carrying his body left its garage.",

      "In recent years, Rahbani also appeared less in the public eye, yet his influence never waned. Younger generations rediscovered his plays online and sampled his music in protest movements. He continued to compose and write, speaking often of his frustration with Lebanon\u2019s political stagnation and decaying public life.",

      "Hulk Hogan has left an indelible mark on professional wrestling and pop culture",
      "Hulk Hogan\u2019s back had weakened, a failed early attempt at slamming all 525 pounds of Andre the Giant left the \u201cImmortal One\" unsteady as the World Wrestling Federation champion once more needed to rally to beat another of wrestling\u2019s baddest bad guys.",
      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

      "He was champion for 1,474 days before losing to Andre in 1988.",
      "Back before the internet spilled behind-the-scenes secrets, and there was easy access to watch wrestling around the globe, WWE created its own version of wrestling history. If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis attack isn't just about abortion,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt's about denying vulnerable communities access to care they rely on every day.\u201d",
      "But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, named a defendant in the suit, defended the provision.",
      "\u201cStates should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care,\u201d spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon said in an email. \u201cIt is a shame that these democrat attorney generals seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.\u201d",
      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "But dyes are \u201challmarks of ultraprocessed food,\u201d said Jerold Mande, a Harvard University nutrition expert and former federal food policy adviser. Targeting them could be a way of letting companies know \u201cthat the way they\u2019re making food is unacceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",
      "The challenge is finding substitutes that will still appeal to children, Miller said.",
      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad \u201cdid not want to be a distraction\u201d and was stepping down from his role as the FDA\u2019s top vaccine regulator \u201cto spend more time with his family,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Prasad was ousted following several recent controversies. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.",
      "Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA\u2019s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "His contrarian approach appeared to match FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who repeatedly praised Prasad\u2019s work and intellect.",
      "But in recent weeks Prasad became a target of conservative activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged Prasad\u2019s past statements criticizing Trump and praising liberal independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",
      "\u201cHow did this Trump-hating Bernie Bro get into the Trump admin???\u201d Loomer posted on X last week.",
      "Prasad also attracted scrutiny for his handling of a recent safety issue surrounding the only approved gene therapy for Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy.",
      "Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder.",
      "Prasad has long been skeptical of the therapy and other muscular dystrophy drugs sold by the drugmaker, Sarepta Therapeutics. As an academic, Prasad gained prominence by attacking the FDA for being too lenient in its standards for approving cancer drugs and other new therapies.",
      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments. During Trump\u2019s first term he signed the \u201c Right to Try \u201d law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.",

      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",
      "Last year, studies suggested that lenacapavir, already used to treat people with HIV, was nearly 100% effective in stopping transmission in both women and men.",
      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",

      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",

    "story": [
      "Afghanistan is seeing the emergence of local female tour guides, in a country whose Taliban government imposes the world\u2019s harshest restrictions on women and girls",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- They wandered through the museum, listening attentively as their guide explained the antiquities in display cabinets. It could have been any tour group, anywhere in the world. But there was something unusual about this one.",
      "The group of foreigners visiting the National Museum of Afghanistan was made up only of women. Its guide was a woman, too \u2014 one of the first Afghan female tour guides in a country whose Taliban rulers impose the severest restrictions on girls and women anywhere in the world.",
      "Somaya Moniry, 24, hadn't known that tour guides existed, as a profession or even as a concept. But while browsing the internet for help on improving her English language skills, she stumbled upon Couchsurfing, an app where travelers connect with locals and stay in their homes.",
      "After hosting a traveler, \u201cI became very passionate about it and it was very interesting for me,\u201d Moniry said. \u201cIt was very unique. I have never heard about it before, so I said: \u2018Why not (do) this?\u2019\u201d",
      "As she showed that first visitor around her hometown in western Afghanistan, she saw a new side to her country.",
      "\u201cMost of the things that we have heard (about Afghanistan) was just \u2026 negativity. The focus of the people, focus of the media, focus of headlines, all of them were just the negativity. And definitely we get influenced by that,\u201d Moniry said.",
      "But for her, Afghanistan is far more nuanced. While there are undoubtedly problems in a place recovering from decades of war and chaos, there is also another side to the complex, stunning country. Her love for her homeland runs deep, and she is eager to share it. She hopes to gradually change people\u2019s perceptions.",
      "\u201cWhenever \u2026 I saw all of that natures, all those beauty, all those positivity, it changed my view totally,\u201d Moniry said in her enthusiastic English. \u201cAnd definitely this can be also for other people.\u201d",
      "One of those visitors is Australian Suzanne Sandral. She originally wanted to see Afghanistan in the 1960s but the pressures of having a family kept her away. Now at 82, she was part of Moniry\u2019s women-only tour group in Kabul.",
      "Afghanistan surprised her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not what I expected at all. I expected to feel rather fearful. I expected to be given a lot of ... accusatory looks. Not at all,\u201d she said during a pause in sightseeing. \u201cWherever you go in the streets, if you smile at someone and give them a little nod or say hello, you get a terrific response. So it\u2019s very different.\u201d",
      "Jackie Birov, a 35-year-old independent traveler from Chicago who was not part of the tour group, called the Afghan people \u201cunbelievably hospitable.\u201d",
      "However, \u201cI\u2019m very aware that I have a lot more freedom than local women,\u201d she said.",
      "Four decades of war have kept tourists away from Afghanistan. But while the Taliban\u2019s takeover of power in August 2021 sent thousands of Afghans fleeing and shocked the world, the end of its insurgency against the previous U.S.-backed government also marked a sharp drop in violence.",

      "Attacks still occasionally occur, mainly by an Islamic State affiliate, and Western countries advise against all travel to Afghanistan. Still, the improved security is increasingly attracting foreign visitors drawn by the dramatic scenery, millennia of history and a deeply ingrained culture of hospitality.",
      "Tourism is a fledgling industry, with annual visitors in the low thousands. Most are independent adventure travelers. But guided package tours are increasing from countries as diverse as China, Greece, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government is keen to welcome them. Isolated on the international stage \u2014 officially recognized only by Russia, which did so in July \u2014 the government sees how potentially lucrative tourism could be.",
      "Tourist visas, typically single-entry ones valid for stays of up to 30 days, have become relatively simple to obtain from the few embassies that issue them. Regular flights connect Kabul with major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul.",
      "For some, the idea of visiting Afghanistan as a tourist is morally abhorrent, particularly given the government\u2019s treatment of women.",
      "Girls are banned from education above primary school level, and women live under myriad restrictions. The government dictates what they can wear in public, where they can go and who they can go with. They cannot walk in parks or eat in restaurants. Beauty salons are banned. A very limited number of professions, such as teaching and carpet weaving, are open to them.",
      "And the rules can change quickly.",
      "But those involved in tourism point to the positive effects that visiting Afghanistan can have.",
      "\u201cI truly believe in ethical tourism,\u201d said Zoe Stephens, 31, a British tour leader at Koryo Tours, a company specializing in unusual destinations. \u201cI believe that you can divide politics and people, and that is the main thing for me. \u2026 A country is not a sum of its politics. It\u2019s a sum of so much more, it\u2019s a sum of its culture, its history, its food, and especially in Afghanistan, its people.\u201d",
      "Of the three recent tours Stephens led in Afghanistan, two were women-only. Working with local female guides, including Moniry, they combine key attractions with visits to women\u2019s centers and cooking and embroidery classes from local women \u2014 worlds that are closed to male travelers.",
      "\u201cWe always try and do something a little bit different that really makes our tours unique, as well as something that kind of gives back to the community,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cSo I felt that working with the female tour guides does both of those things really well.\u201d",
      "The groups are small \u2014 one had eight women, the other three \u2014 but the company is looking to build a network of female guides across Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhat we try and do with this tour, especially the women\u2019s tour, is conquer those ethical concerns,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe idea is to learn about the lives of Afghan women in context.\u201d",

      "Syria's uprising-turned-conflict displaced half of the country's pre-war population of 23 million over the last 14 years. Lebanon hosted an estimated 1.5 million refugees, at one point making up roughly a quarter of its six million people, with many having been smuggled across the border and unregistered with the UN.",
      "The new plan has the UN refugee agency offering $100 in cash to each repatriated Syrian refugee and the Lebanese authorities waiving any fees or fines they owe. The UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration will provide them with buses for their return journey.",
      "The UNHCR also says it will help returning Syrians with \"cash grants, legal assistance for civil documents, psychosocial support, livelihood opportunities, and other protection services.\u201d",
      "Lebanese authorities have repeatedly requested the repatriation of Syrian refugees over the years, a call that grew louder with the widespread poverty in the Mediterranean country and shrinking funding for aid agencies. But Syria under Assad was not yet safe for their return, according to major rights organizations.",
      "Many Syrians had also previously said the war, forced conscription under Syria\u2019s former government, and unpaid residency fines in Lebanon have held them back from returning.",
      "But Syria now has a new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the surprise offensive that ousted Assad, and the Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam's government hopes Syrians will sign up for the joint repatriation plan.",
      "The UNHCR estimates that over 205,000 Syrians have crossed back into the country from Lebanon since December, of which at least 126,000 were confirmed to be full returns, said Abou Khaled.",
      "UNHCR Lebanon spokesperson Lisa Abou Khaled says about 17,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon have already signed up to go back to their home country, though the vast majority have opted not to take the buses.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Opposition figure Bobi Wine said the political climate in Uganda has \u201cgone from bad to worse\u201d ahead of presidential polls set for early next year, citing threats to himself and other activists mobilizing against the longtime president.",
      "Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, said the threats he faces as President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s main opponent \u201ccome in no unclear terms.\u201d",
      "Fears for Wine's safety have grown in recent months, fueled by regular attacks on X from Museveni\u2019s son and presumptive heir, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba. In January, Kainerugaba wrote he \u201cwould cut off\u201d Wine\u2019s head if the president allowed it, and he drew widespread criticism in May for saying he was holding Wine\u2019s missing bodyguard \u201cin my basement.\u201d The bodyguard later appeared unable to walk without support when presented in court, the apparent victim of torture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a constant reminder that the threat is real, because this is no ordinary person,\u201d Wine said, speaking of Gen. Kainerugaba. \u201cThis is a person that is not only the son of the person in charge of the country but is also the person in charge of all the organs of violence. He heads the military, the police, the prisons, you know. He is above the law, and he has acted as such.\u201d",
      "Wine, 43, spoke to The Associated Press in an exclusive interview at the headquarters of his National Unity Platform party in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, a site briefly occupied by security forces in a raid last month.",
      "Museveni, 80, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and has even questioned his patriotism. But Wine, who denies the allegations, has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.",
      "In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as the president's most potent challenger in decades. Wine alleged his victory was stolen through widespread ballot stuffing and other malpractices. Electoral authorities disputed the allegations.",
      "Wine\u2019s party claims dozens of its followers have been jailed or disappeared since 2021. For Wine, the attacks are meant to \u201csend fear down the nerves of all those that work with me and all those that stand for what I stand for.\u201d",
      "Wine and Museveni are set to face each other again in presidential polls scheduled for January 2026.",
      "Museveni has been campaigning in recent days in Kampala as he tries to bolster his chances among people likely to support Wine, urban dwellers often without a reliable source of income and who hope a change of government will benefit them.",
      "Wine often describes himself as a \u201cghetto president,\u201d citing his early days in a poor neighborhood in Kampala. He has maintained a high profile in this East African nation since the early 2000s, when he rose to fame as a singer whose dancehall music captivated audiences. Wine\u2019s compositions later grew critical of the government, earning him a reputation as a prominent contrarian while his musical peers were sometimes seen to be supportive of the government.",

      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- The decision of Ivory Coast\u2019s President Alassane Ouattara to run for a fourth term risks a return to a past era of \u201cold guard dictator rule,\u201d an analyst warned on Wednesday.",
      "Ibrahim Anoba, an Africa affairs analyst at the Atlas Network, was speaking a day after Ouattara ended months of speculation about his contested candidacy with an announcement that is likely to lead to a near-guaranteed extension of a presidency that started in 2010.",
      "While Ouattara, 83, said his decision to run was informed by the \u201cunprecedented security, economic, and monetary challenges\u201d the country faces, his announcement comes after the disqualification of most of his prominent rivals, including former Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam.",
      "After changing the constitution in 2016 to remove presidential term limits, Ouattara is the latest leader in West and Central Africa to attempt to stay in power with little or no challenge from a weakened opposition.",
      "Togo\u2019s Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 swapped the presidential system with a parliamentary system and introduced a new all-powerful role, while in Cameroon Paul Biya is eyeing an eighth term after being in power since 1982, nearly half his lifetime. Central African Republic\u2019s Faustin Touadera is seeking a third term amid a constitutional controversy.",
      "With Ivory Coast considered a regional powerhouse, analysts say a weakened opposition and the constitutional change that kept Ouattara in power after abolishing initial term limits could lead the country to an era of one-man rule, especially in a region where democracy is increasingly being challenged.",
      "Opposition protests against Ouattara have been blocked, and several protesters have been arrested and accused of disturbing public order.",
      "\u201cWe might be sliding back to that era of old men, old guard dictator rule in West Africa because (of) the attitude of the military and equally the civilian rulers,\u201d said Anoba. \u201cAnd the announcement of Ouattarra is a reflection of that reality.\u201d",
      "Opposition politicians are now rallying against Ouattara, which could feed into a growing wave of discontent among citizens battling declining economies and security challenges.",
      "\u201cIt is a repetition of the same problem that we have seen lead to the same consequences,\u201d said Anoba.",

      "Ochieng added: \u201cThere is also almost like an equivalent in the sense that people want to prolong their stay in power and are willing to use constitutional and transitional means to achieve.\"",

      "However, beneath the veneer of stability is a firm grip on government institutions that makes it impossible for the opposition to challenge the ruling party, analysts say.",

      "The EU-U.S. tariff agreement sealed over the weekend has been described as a \u201cdark day\u201d for Europe and even a capitulation to American demands",
      "BRUSSELS -- France\u2019s prime minister described it as a \u201cdark day\u201d for the European Union, a \u201csubmission\u201d to U.S. tariff demands. Commentators said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s handshake with President Donald Trump amounted to capitulation.",
      "The trouble is, Europe depends mightily on the United States, and not just for trade.",
      "Mirroring Trump, Von der Leyen gushed that the arrangement she endorsed over the weekend to set U.S. tariff levels on most European exports to 15%, which is 10% higher than currently, was \u201chuge.\u201d Her staff texted reporters insisting that the pact, which starts to enter force on Friday, is the \u201cbiggest trade deal ever.\u201d",
      "A month after NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte ingratiated himself with Trump by referring to him as \u201cdaddy,\u201d the Europeans had again conceded that swallowing the costs and praising an unpredictable president is more palatable than losing America.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the trade. It\u2019s about security. It\u2019s about Ukraine. It\u2019s about current geopolitical volatility. I cannot go into all the details,\u201d EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters Monday.",

      "Indeed, Europe depends on the U.S. for its security and that security is anything but a game, especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. U.S. allies are convinced that, should he win, President Vladimir Putin is likely to take aim at one of them next.",
      "So high are these fears that European countries are buying U.S. weapons to help Ukraine to defend itself. Some are prepared to send their own air defense systems and replace them with U.S. equipment, once it can be delivered.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they\u2019ll be doing what they want, but I guess it\u2019s for the most part working with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said Sunday, sounding ambivalent about America\u2019s role in the alliance.",
      "The Europeans also are wary about a U.S. troop drawdown, which the Pentagon is expected to announce by October. Around 84,000 U.S. personnel are based in Europe, and they guarantee NATO\u2019s deterrent effect against an adversary like Russia.",
      "At the same time, Trump is slapping duties on America\u2019s own NATO partners, ostensibly due to concerns about U.S. security interests, using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, a logic that seems absurd from across the Atlantic.",
      "\u201cThe EU is in a difficult situation because we\u2019re very dependent on the U.S. for security,\u201d said Niclas Poitiers at the Bruegel research institution in Brussels. \u201cUkraine is a very big part of that, but also generally our defense is underwritten by NATO.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there was not a big willingness to pick a major fight, which is the one (the EU) might have needed with the U.S.\u201d to better position itself on trade, Poitiers told The Associated Press about key reasons for von der Leyen to accept the tariff demands.",
      "Part of the agreement involves a commitment to buy American oil and gas. Over the course of the Russia-Ukraine war, now in its fourth year, most of the EU has slashed its dependence on unreliable energy supplies from Russia, but Hungary and Slovakia still have not.",

      "Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision between a military helicopter and passenger plane over Washington begin Wednesday morning and may reveal new insights into the crash",
      "Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January begin Wednesday and aim to reveal new insights into what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will question witnesses and investigators about how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and its air traffic controllers and the Army may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001. It's likely too early for the board to identify the cause of the crash.",
      "The American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas collided with a Black Hawk helicopter while coming into land at Ronald Reagan National Airport and was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the travelling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Aviation attorney Bob Clifford, who is working to file one of the first lawsuits against the government next month, said he hopes NTSB will look beyond the immediate factors that caused this crash to highlight the bigger ongoing concerns in the crowded Washington airspace.",
      "\u201cIn this particular instance, there\u2019s a much broader picture. And that is the known problems that were being ignored about an unsafe environment for the commercial aircraft to be navigating with the military aviation helicopters in the area,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "Even though the final NTSB report won't be released until sometime next year, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz isn't waiting to propose changes. He introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.\u201d",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. It also would require the FAA to evaluate helicopter routes near airports and require the Army Inspector General to review the Army\u2019s aviation safety practices.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",
      "\u201cIn 2008, we sent a letter to FAA stating the board believes that the equipage of aircraft with ADS-B In capability will provide \u2014 and I want to stress this \u2014 an immediate and substantial contribution to safety, especially during operations in and around airports,\u201d she said.",

      "Morocco\u2019s argan forests are thinning under the strain of climate change, overharvesting and booming demand for luxury cosmetics",
      "SMIMOU, Morocco -- Argan oil runs through your fingers like liquid gold \u2014 hydrating, luscious, and restorative. Prized worldwide as a miracle cosmetic, it\u2019s more than that in Morocco. It\u2019s a lifeline for rural women and a byproduct of a forest slowly buckling under the weight of growing demand.",
      "To make it, women crouch over stone mills and grind down kernels. One kilogram \u2014 roughly two days of work \u2014 earns them around $3, enough for a modest foothold in an economy where opportunities are scarce. It also links them to generations past.",
      "\u201cWe were born and raised here. These traditions come from nature, what our parents and grandparents have taught us and what we\u2019ve inherited,\u201d cooperative worker Fatma Mnir said.",
      "Long a staple in local markets, argan oil today is in luxury hair and skin care products lining drugstore aisles worldwide. But its runaway popularity is threatening argan forests, with overharvesting piled on top of drought straining trees once seen as resilient in the harshest of conditions.",
      "Hafida El Hantati, owner of one of the cooperatives that harvests the fruit and presses it for oil, said the stakes go beyond the trees, threatening cherished traditions.",
      "\u201cWe must take care of this tree and protect it because if we lose it, we will lose everything that defines us and what we have now,\u201d she said at the Ajddigue cooperative outside the coastal town of Essaouira.",
      "For centuries, argan trees have supported life in the arid hills between the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas Mountains, feeding people and animals, holding soil in place and helping keep the desert from spreading.",
      "The spiny trees can survive in areas with less than an inch of annual rain and heat up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). They endure drought with roots that stretch as far as 115 feet (35 meters) underground. Goats climb trees, chomp their fruit, and eventually disperse seeds as part of the forest's regeneration cycle.",
      "Moroccans stir the oil into nut butters and drizzle it over tagines. Rich in vitamin E, it's lathered onto dry hair and skin to plump, moisturize and stave off damage. Some use it to calm eczema or heal chicken pox.",
      "But the forest has thinned. Trees bear fewer fruit, their branches gnarled from thirst. In many places, cultivated land has replaced them as fields of citrus and tomatoes, many grown for export, have expanded.",
      "Communities once managed forests collectively, setting rules for grazing and harvesting. Now the system is fraying, with theft routinely reported.",
      "But a forest that covered about 5,405 square miles (14,000 square kilometers) at the turn of the century has shrunk by 40%. Scientists warn that argan trees are not invincible.",
      "\u201cBecause argan trees acted as a green curtain protecting a large part of southern Morocco against the encroaching Sahara, their slow disappearance has become considered as an ecological disaster,\u201d said Zoubida Charrouf, a chemist who researches argan at Universit\u00e9 Mohammed V in Rabat.",
      "Shifting climate is a part of the problem. Fruit and flowers sprout earlier each year as rising temperatures push the seasons out of sync.",
      "Goats that help spread seeds can be destructive, too, especially if they feed on seedlings before they mature. Overgrazing has become worse as herders and fruit collectors fleeing drier regions encroach on plots long allocated to specific families.",
      "The forests also face threats from camels bred and raised by the region's wealthy. Camels stretch their necks into trees and chomp entire branches, leaving lasting damage, Charrouf said.",
      "Today, women peel, crack and press argan for oil at hundreds of cooperatives. Much makes its way through middlemen to be sold in products by companies and subsidiaries of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Unilever, and Est\u00e9e Lauder.",
      "But workers say they earn little while watching profits flow elsewhere. Cooperatives say much of the pressure stems from climbing prices. A 1-liter bottle sells for 600 Moroccan dirhams ($60), up from 25 dirhams ($2.50) three decades ago. Products infused with argan sell for even more abroad. Cosmetics companies call argan the most expensive vegetal oil on the market.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic upended global demand and prices and many cooperatives closed. Cooperative leaders say new competitors have flooded the market just as drought has diminished how much oil can be squeezed from each fruit.",
      "Cooperatives were set up to provide women a base pay and share profits each month. But Union of Women\u2019s Argan Cooperatives President Jamila Id Bourrous said few make more than Morocco\u2019s minimum monthly wage.",

      "The idea is to expand forest cover and show that argan, if properly managed, can be a viable source of income.

      "Retailers rushing to stock up before expected tariffs have boosted the Port of Savannah to its second-busiest year",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Retailers scrambling to stock up ahead of anticipated stiff tariffs on imports boosted the Port of Savannah, one of the top U.S. container ports, to its second-busiest year ever, Georgia officials said Tuesday.",
      "The Savannah port moved 5.7 million container units of imports and exports across its docks in the 2025 fiscal year that ended June 30, the Georgia Ports Authority reported. That's an increase of 8.6% over the prior fiscal year and just shy of the record 5.76 million container units Savannah handled in fiscal 2022.",
      "The growth was caused in part by a surge in cargo since President Donald Trump returned to office in January promising heavy tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners. But double-digit increases Savannah saw during the spring months were followed by a sizable drop in June container volumes as Trump's on-again, off-again tactics continued to fuel uncertainty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be this very up-and-down time until things get settled,\" said Georgia Ports Authority CEO Griff Lynch, who praised Trump's trade deal with the European Union as a step toward restoring stability. \u201cI\u2019m sure all of it will come together. It\u2019s just a matter of timing.\u201d",
      "The Port of Savannah is the nation's No. 4 seaport for cargo shipped in containers, giant metal boxes used to transport goods ranging from consumer electronics to frozen chickens by ship, rail and truck.",

      "MASERU, Lesotho -- The deafening roar of hundreds of sewing machines has gone silent. Spools of thread in every color are covered in dust. The warehouse is dark and empty.",
      "In the tiny African nation of Lesotho, clothing manufacturer Tzicc's business has dried up in the face of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. A few months ago, work was steady. The factory's 1,300 employees has made and exported sportswear to American stores, including JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "But when Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, Lesotho found itself topping the list, with a rate of 50% \u2014 higher even than that of China, where the economy is 8,000 times larger. Officials here and economic experts said they were baffled.",
      "Since then, Trump backed off \u2014 temporarily. During a monthslong pause for trade talks, the U.S. has charged a baseline 10% tariff and announced new rates for dozens of countries starting Friday. Lesotho\u2019s rate will be set at Trump\u2019s whim, with aides suggesting that tariffs charged on goods from smaller African countries could top 10%.",
      "Many nations have received letters laying out a new tariff. With the pause set to expire Friday, Lesotho officials say they've not received one and they find themselves among the countries where Trump says officials simply don\u2019t have time for one-on-one negotiations. Leaders \u2014 and the 12,000 people employed by garment factories exporting to the U.S. market \u2014 are still waiting.",
      "The damage has already rippled through Lesotho\u2019s economy, where textile manufacturing comprises the largest private industry with more than 30,000 workers in 2024.",
      "For Tzicc and its customers, the threat and apparent singling out of Lesotho were enough. Management decided to rush to deliver preexisting orders before tariffs resumed. But American buyers stopped placing new orders. With no work left, virtually all the factory's employees were sent home \u2014 potentially permanently.",
      "\u201cWell, unfortunately, we finished,\u201d factory compliance manager Rahila Omar said, pointing out the irony of the strategy as she walked among rows of silenced and covered machines. \u201cThat is why now we don't have any work.\u201d",
      "Omar is one of a handful of employees left in the eerily quiet factory. A few remain in the accounting department; others empty leftover stock to a warehouse elsewhere.",
      "Officials and workers fear this may be a sign of what's to come for other factories in Lesotho, where poverty is widespread among the population of 2 million and most textile workers single-handedly support their families.",
      "In March, a month before slapping Lesotho with the 50% tariff, Trump described it as a place \u201cnobody has ever heard of,\" struggling to pronounce the nation's name in a speech criticizing U.S. foreign aid.",
      "It's true Lesotho is a \u201cvery minuscule economy,\" as its own trade minister, Mokhethi Shelile, described it.",
      "But its relationship with Washington dates back decades. The U.S. was the first country to open an embassy in the capital, Maseru, after Lesotho declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The military received U.S. training, and hundreds of millions in U.S. funds were sent to Lesotho to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic via the now defunctUSAID office and the PEPFAR program.",
      "As textiles grew to become Lesotho's main export, some 75% of its product went to the U.S. Lesotho became known as Africa's denim capital. If an American purchased jeans from a U.S. brand such as Wrangler or Levi's, they may have been \u201cMade in Lesotho,\u201d as tags still note.",
      "In 2000, the U.S. signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, allowing Lesotho and other African nations to export goods to the U.S. duty free.",
      "Shelile said he was in the process of negotiating AGOA\u2019s September renewal when he was awakened in the middle of the night by texts from aides bearing news of the 50% U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cNo, this cannot be real,\u201d Shelile remembers thinking. \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this?\u201d",
      "According to the Trump administration, Lesotho charges a 99% tariff on U.S. goods. The government here said it doesn\u2019t know how the U.S. calculated that.",
      "In theory, the tariff decision was based on trade deficit: Lesotho\u2019s exports to the U.S. were around $240 million last year \u2014 mainly clothing and diamonds \u2014 and imports from the U.S. were only $2.8 million. But in practice, the math is more complicated than that. And in reality, Lesotho simply cannot afford to import more U.S. products. Nearly half the population lives below the poverty line.",

It reinspected all blades made at the factory and removed other blades made there from the Vineyard Wind location.",
      "In the final days of the Biden administration, federal regulators lifted a suspension order on the project, pending the removal of all installed blades manufactured by GE Vernova.",
      "On Tuesday, town officials accused Vineyard Wind of violating a contract made with Nantucket five years ago that requires the company to communicate regularly with the town at all stages of project development and deployment. It also said Vineyard Wind hasn't done enough to reduce light pollution or engage the town with its emergency response plans following the blade failure.",
      "Nantucket officials refused to include Vineyard Wind as a signatory in the $10.5 million settlement, citing the company\u2019s \u201clack of leadership, transparency, and stewardship\u201d following the blade failure.",

      "President Donald Trump says he'll impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India\u2019s purchasing of Russian oil",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he\u2019ll impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India\u2019s purchasing of Russian oil.",
      "Trump said on his Truth Social platform that India \u201cis our friend\u201d but its \u201cTariffs are far too high\u201d on U.S. goods.",
      "The Republican president added that India buys military equipment and oil from Russia, which he said has enabled the war in Ukraine. As a result, he intends to charge an additional \u201cpenalty\u201d starting on Friday as part of the launch of his administration\u2019s revised tariffs on multiple countries.",
      "The new tariffs could put India at a disadvantage in the U.S. market relative to Vietnam, Bangladesh and, possibly, China, said Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.",
      "\u201cWe are back to square one as Trump hasn\u2019t spelled out what the penalties would be in addition to the tariff,\" Sahai said. \u201cThe demand for Indian goods is bound to be hit.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes after a slew of negotiated trade frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 all of which Trump said would open markets for American goods while enabling the U.S. to raise tax rates on imports. The president views tariff revenues as a way to help offset the budget deficit increases tied to his recent income tax cuts and generate more domestic factory jobs.",
      "While Trump has effectively wielded tariffs as a cudgel to reset the terms of trade, the economic impact is uncertain as most economists expect a slowdown in U.S. growth and greater inflationary pressures as some of the costs of the taxes are passed along to domestic businesses and consumers.",
      "Trump's approach of putting a 15% tariff on America's longstanding allies in the EU is also generating pushback \u2014 possibly causing European partners as well as Canada to seek alternatives to U.S. leadership on the world stage.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday in the aftermath of the trade framework that Europe \u201cdoes not see itself sufficiently\u201d as a global power, saying in a cabinet meeting that negotiations with the U.S. will continue as the agreement gets formalized.",
      "\u201cTo be free, you have to be feared,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe have not been feared enough. There is a greater urgency than ever to accelerate the European agenda for sovereignty and competitiveness.\u201d",
      "Washington has long sought to develop a deeper partnership with New Delhi, which is seen as a bulwark against China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has established a good working relationship with Trump, and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",

The two countries have had five rounds of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement.

      "This summer, President Donald Trump has begun to chisel back Medicaid and food stamps",
      "WASHINGTON -- On this day in 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation into law that launched Medicaid, creating a U.S. health care safety net for millions of low-income Americans in what would become one of the crowning achievements of his domestic legacy.",
      "A year earlier, he did the same for food stamps, drawing on President John F. Kennedy\u2019s first executive order for the development of \u201ca positive food and nutrition program for all Americans.\u201d",
      "This summer, with the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump began to chisel them back.",
      "The Republican Party's big tax and spending bill delivered not just $4.5 trillion in tax breaks for Americans but some of the most substantial changes to the landmark safety net programs in their history. The trade-off will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from federal health care and food assistance, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and by shifting certain federal costs onto the states.",
      "While Republicans in Congress argue the trims are needed to rightsize the federal programs that have grown over the decades and to prevent rising federal deficits, they are also moving toward a long-sought GOP goal of shrinking the federal government and the services it provides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making the first changes to the welfare state in generations,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a recent podcast interview.",
      "As the tax breaks and spending cuts law begins to take shape, it is unleashing a new era of uncertainty for the safety net programs that millions of people in communities across the nation have grown to depend on, with political ramifications to come.",
      "Polling shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs. Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Local governments are scrambling to figure out how they will comply with the new landscape, calculating whether they will need to raise their own taxes to cover costs, trim budgets elsewhere or cut back the aid provided to Americans.",
      "\u201cThe cuts are really big, they are really broad and they are deeply damaging,\u201d said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute in Washington.",
      "\u201cThe consequences are millions of people losing health care coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cMillions of people losing food assistance. And the net result of that is higher poverty, more hardship.\u201d",
      "At the same time, certain people who receive aid, including parents of teenagers and older Americans up to age 64, will have to prepare to work, engage in classes or do community service for 80 hours a month to meet new requirements.",
      "All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 10 million more people will end up without health insurance. Some 3 million fewer people will participate in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "\u201cPeople are really concerned what this means for their fiscal health,\u201d said Mark Ritacco, chief governmental affairs officer at the National Association of Counties, which held its annual conference the week after Trump signed the bill into law.",
      "The organization had pushed senators to delay the start dates for some Medicaid changes, and it hopes that further conversations with lawmakers in Congress can prevent some of them from ever taking hold. At its conference, questions swirled.",

      "And it quickly took off. Almost every state signed on to participate in Medicaid by 1970, according to the KFF, an organization focused on health policy. It soon went beyond covering its core population to include pregnant women, school-age children and not just the very poor but also those with incomes just over the federal poverty limit, which is now about $15,650 annually for a single person and $26,650 for a family of three.",
      "In the 15 years since the Affordable Care Act became law under President Barack Obama, Medicaid has grown substantially as most states opted to join the federal expansion. Some 80 million adults and children are covered.",

      "Fernandez was routed 6-4, 6-1 by Australian Maya Joint in just 1 hour, 15 minutes. The No. 24-ranked player won her fourth career WTA title Sunday in Washington and was hoping for additional rest before returning to the court in Montreal.",
      "Fernandez said she received \u201ca lot of promises\u201d that she would play during Tuesday\u2019s night session, giving her more time to recover between the two tournaments, but learned Sunday while traveling that wouldn\u2019t be the case.",
      "\u201cI did not receive that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat hurt me because I was very looking forward to be playing at night, but I guess it\u2019s a little bit political issues at that point.\u201d",
      "Instead, top-seeded Coco Gauff played fellow American Danielle Collins to open the night session, overcoming 23 double-faults to win 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (2) for her first victory since the French Open final.",

      "Tetreault added that exceptions had already been made for Fernandez, the 2021 U.S. Open runner-up. The 22-year-old and Joint were among the final three first-round matches held until Tuesday, despite her half of the bracket starting play on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWTA protocols mean first-round matches need to be completed before second-round matches are played, ensuring fairness to all players,\u201d Tennis Canada said in a statement. \u201cGiven Leylah won the title in Washington on Sunday, she was not able to arrive in Montreal until the early hours of Monday morning.

      "And Henry didn\u2019t disappoint his skipper.",
      "Bennett and Curran, recovered from a broken hand, both were caught by Will Young at the third slip as Henry consistently challenged the openers with his immaculate line and length. Welch and Ervine seemed to have settled down in the last half hour with their sweeps and reverse sweeps against the spinners before Henry returned and had Welch caught in the second slip.",
      "New Zealand has won 11 of its 17 test matches against Zimbabwe and drawn six. This is the first match between the two teams since 2016 in cricket\u2019s traditional format. Zimbabwe has a poor home test record with its last win coming against Pakistan in 2013.",

      "College coaches are racing to master retention as revenue sharing and NIL opportunities steer athletes toward the transfer portal",
      "Whether it was an ACC, SEC, Big Ten or Big 12 coach taking the podium at media days, one theme remained consistent: In an era where revenue sharing and NIL opportunities can swiftly steer athletes toward the transfer portal, programs across the country are racing to master the art of player retention.",
      "Its importance is clear to Arkansas coach Sam Pittman, who has seen all but five players from his 2023 recruiting class leave for different programs.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s what it\u2019s not because of: the way they\u2019re treated, because of the way they\u2019re developed, because of the way they\u2019re taught,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not the reason. It could be playing time. It could be finances. Probably the majority of it is finances, but you\u2019d have to ask those guys.\u201d",
      "More than 3,000 Bowl Subdivision players reportedly entered the transfer portal this past spring, which would average out to about 22 players per team. For the Razorbacks, 10 starters will be back and one of them is senior defensive lineman Cam Ball. He has remained with Arkansas his entire career, a somewhat rare occurrence for an NFL hopeful these days.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a loyal guy. I\u2019m loyal to the state of Arkansas; Arkansas has been loyal to me,\" Ball said.",
      "Arkansas, like many schools, is also trying to scare up more money from donors as it faces the financial ramifications of the $2.8 billion House settlement; last fall, the athletic director said the school needed some $12 million more annually to \u201cbe in the NIL game from a football perspective.\u201d Besides the money, the Razorbacks have to find talented players; Ball grew up in Atlanta, just barely within the regional footprint in which Pittman prefers to recruit.",
      "\u201cWe have to go outside our state,\" Pittman said. \u201cIn-state recruiting has changed over the last three or four years because of NIL. So you have to think about the talent \u2014 who it is versus what pay is expected. So that\u2019s been a little bit more difficult in our state.\u201d",
      "Pittman isn\u2019t the only coach who wants prospects to be familiar with what their college experience will look like before making any life-changing decisions. Florida coach Billy Napier paints a clear picture of life in Gainesville and the challenges and perks that come with it.",
      "\u201cWe present our product in a way where we\u2019re selling the degree, the alumni network, the Gator-made program, and you have to be up for the challenge of trying to get Florida back to where it\u2019s been before,\" he said. \"And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "Florida\u2019s 2023 recruiting class remains mostly intact, and from Napier\u2019s perspective, hungrier than ever. Compared to other SEC teams, the Gators have had more success with retention. Napier doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cWe told them when they came in, you know, look, it\u2019s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows here. We\u2019re in this thing for the long haul,\u201d Napier said. \u201cI think a lot of this is how you pitch it in recruiting. We\u2019re going to continue to do that, and retention is more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "Coaches scrambling to prevent transfers and maintain consistency isn\u2019t exclusive to the SEC. The approval of the House settlement is a double-edged sword when it comes to retention, and Power Four schools and beyond are feeling the effects. Third-party NIL deals are no longer the only negotiation tactic schools need to worry about.",
      "Complex contracts are becoming common and legal risks grow for athletes and programs alike as college football increasingly resembles the pros. Some deals are being negotiated solely by athletes as young as 18.",

      "Fans at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 indoor practice facility roared.",
      "They\u2019re used to Evans making all the plays but No. 13 still manages to impress everyone watching.",
      "The six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver makes it look so effortless the way he glides after the ball. His routes are smooth and precise, his hands soft. At 6-foot-5, 231 pounds, he has a powerful frame so he can outmuscle defenders or outfinesse them when he needs to.",
      "Evans is the only player in NFL history to start his career with 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Only Jerry Rice had that many at any point. Evans is aiming for 12 in a row in a year when the Buccaneers celebrate the franchise\u2019s 50th season.

      "At a position known for players with look-at-me personalities \u2014 Tyreek Hill, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens, Chad Johnson \u2014 Evans lets his performance do most of the talking. He\u2019s quiet, humble and community-oriented. Evans is a four-time NFL Walter Payton Man of The Year nominee for the work he does along with his wife, Ashli, through their foundation, which empowers youth, encourages education and stands against domestic violence.",
      "Evans joined the Buccaneers in 2014 as the seventh overall pick and has become one of the greatest players in franchise history. Evans and Chris Godwin were a big reason why Tom Brady chose Tampa Bay in 2020 and the Buccaneers ended up winning a Super Bowl that season.",
      "From catching passes from Josh McCown and Mike Glennon as a rookie to Jameis Winston to Brady to Baker Mayfield, Evans continues to produce. He has 836 career catches for 12,684 yards and 105 touchdowns.",
      "Evans missed three games last season due to injury and didn\u2019t reach 1,000 yards until he caught a 9-yard pass on the final play of a 27-19 victory over the Saints that the Buccaneers needed to secure their fourth straight NFC South title.",

      "The team has won five straight games, including three on the road, heading into Tuesday night\u2019s matchup with the Las Vegas Aces. It\u2019s only the third time in the past five years that the team has won five or more games in a row. The Sparks had a nine-game winning streak in 2020 and a six-game one in 2023.",

      "\u201cWe've been playing better in the last month, part of that is getting bodies back,\u201d Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said. \u201cWe're playing with more pace, so they're figuring it out. We don't play a traditional style, there's a lot of freedom.\u201d",
      "The Sparks have been getting strong contributions from all five of their starters. Kelsey Plum and Dearica Hamby are averaging 20.8 points each. Rickea Jackson and Azura Stevens are right behind at 18.2 points and 17.0, respectively. Jackson torched the Liberty on Saturday for 20 points in the first-half and hit the game-winning shot at the buzzer.",
      "Los Angeles will also welcome back Cameron Brink on Tuesday. She's been sidelined for 13 months with an ACL injury.",
      "Minnesota remained the No. 1 team in the poll with Atlanta jumping up to the second spot. New York was third and Phoenix fell to fourth. Seattle was fifth and Indiana sixth, with Las Vegas next. The Sparks moved up two spots to eighth. Washington and Golden State followed Los Angeles. Dallas, Chicago and Connecticut rounded out the poll.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A 12-year-old boy died from a brain-eating amoeba two weeks after a holiday weekend on a popular South Carolina lake.",
      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",
      "Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn\u2019t closed and no water testing was performed.",
      "\u201cMy son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,\u201d Carr said.",

      "There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.",
      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",
      "\u201cMy son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,\u201d Carr said.",
      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That\u2019s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria \u2014 also referred to as blue-green algae \u2014 are plant-like organisms that live in water.",
      "The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.",
      "The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or \u201cbloom,\" in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.",
      "Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "\u201cLast year (2024), we observed a staggering 7,000 password attacks per second (more than double the rate from 2023),\" Microsoft wrote in a blog post. \"Although passwords have been around for centuries, we hope their reign over our online world is ending.\u201d",
      "Authenticator has been a staple in providing multi-factor authentication, one-time passwords and biometric logins for services and some websites. Although the app will continue to provide authentication for passkey-compatible services, it is pushing its password management and autofill functions out to the company's Edge browser instead.",
      "Note that not all websites and applications have adopted passkeys yet, so many places still rely on passwords.",
      "If you haven't yet moved to a different password manager system or set up your passkeys, we're here to help.",
      "Passkeys do away with complex 14 character passwords because you never need to see them. Instead you are using existing biometrics like your face or fingerprints, digital patterns or PINs to access your accounts.",
      "Passkeys are made up of two parts of a code that only makes sense when they\u2019re combined, kind of like a digital key and padlock. You keep half of the encrypted code, typically stored either in the cloud with a compatible verification app \u2014 including Authenticator \u2014 or on a physical security dongle. The other half is stored on the participating apps, services or accounts you want to access.",
      "The bad news? You do have to set up individual passkeys for each service or application that accepts them. Keeping track of where you can use them versus traditional passwords can be challenging.",
      "If you've opened Authenticator in the last few months, you likely were prompted to set up a passkey through a guided experience.",
      "If you didn't receive such a prompt, you can set up a new passkey by opening the authenticator app on your device. Find and tap on your account, then select \u201cset up a passkey\u201d option. Follow the app's instructions.",

      "When big infrastructure projects spring up, one crucial law \u2014 the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 has for decades been a key way the government has required powerful industry interests to consider the environment and the public\u2019s voice",
      "When President Donald Trump rolled out a plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers, a key goal was wiping away barriers to rapid growth.",
      "And that meant taking aim at the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 a 55-year-old, bedrock law aimed at protecting the environment through a process that requires agencies to consider a project's possible impacts and allows the public to be heard before a project is approved. Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure. Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",
      "Trump's administration has been weakening the law for months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act.

      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien, who later worked at the Grand Canyon Trust, also co-chaired a working group that weighed in on a 2012 Forest Service proposal, finalized in 2016, for aspen restoration on Monroe Mountain in Utah. Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

    "story": [
      "Fishing for krill near Antarctica has surged to a record high, nearing a seasonal catch limit that could close the fishery early",
      "MIAMI -- Trawling near Antarctica for krill \u2014 a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming \u2014 has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

One peer-reviewed study last year found that krill remove from the atmosphere and store in the ocean 20 million tons of carbon annually. That\u2019s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year.",

      "Ship tracking data analyzed by Global Fishing Watch at the request of the AP also showed a higher concentration of trawling. Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing.",
      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",
      "Then they watch.",
      "The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence.",
      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",
      "\u201cNo other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively\" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project.",
      "Still, Congram warns, technology \u201cis not a panacea.\u201d",
      "\u201cNinety percent of searches are resolved with a good witness and digging,\u201d he said.",
      "Silv\u00e1n walks by a site where scientists buried 14 pigs about two years ago. He says they may not know how well the technology works, where and when it can be used, or under what conditions, for at least three years.",
      "\u201cFlowers came up because of the phosphorous at the surface, we didn\u2019t see that last year,\u201d he said as he took measurements at one of the gravesites. \u201cThe mothers who search say that that little yellow flower always blooms over the tombs and they use them as a guide.\u201d",

      "Pigs and humans are closely related, famously sharing about 98% of DNA. But for the mapping project, the physical similarities also matter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, pigs resemble humans in size, fat distribution and the structure and thickness of skin.",
      "A big Colombian drone mounted with a hyperspectral camera flies over the pig burial site. Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t pure science,\u201d Silv\u00e1n said. \u201cIt is science and action. Everything learned has to be applied immediately, rather than wait for it to mature, because there\u2019s urgency.\u201d",
      "Researchers also employ thermal drones, laser scanners and other gadgets to register anomalies, underground movements and electrical currents. One set of graves is encased behind a pane of transparent acrylic, providing a window for scientists to observe the pigs\u2019 decomposition in real time.",
      "The Jalisco commission compares and analyzes flies, beetles, plants and soil recovered from the human and pig graves.",
      "Each grave is a living \u201cmicro ecosystem,\u201d said Tunuari Ch\u00e1vez, the commission's director of context analysis.",
      "Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silv\u00e1n and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a \u201cbody farm.\u201d They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat good is science or technology if it doesn\u2019t solve problems?\u201d he said.",
      "They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared.",
      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",
      "\u201cThe knowledge flows in both directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Maribel Cede\u00f1o, who has been looking for her missing brother for four years, said she believes the drones and other technology will be helpful.",
      "\u201cI never imagined being in this situation, finding bodies, becoming such an expert,\u201d she said of her quest.",
      "H\u00e9ctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support.",
      "Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",
      "Congram, the forensic scientist, said researchers are aware of the limitations of technology, but that \u201cyou always have to try, fail, fail again and keep trying.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced YouTube will be among the social media platforms that must ensure account holders are at least 16-years-old from December, reversing a position taken months ago on the popular video-sharing service.",
      "YouTube was listed as an exemption in November last year when the Parliament passed world-first laws that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and X.",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells released rules Wednesday that decide which online services are defined as \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d and which avoid the age limit.",

      "Wells defended applying the restrictions to YouTube and said the government would not be intimidated by threats of legal action from the platform\u2019s U.S. owner, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cThe evidence cannot be ignored that four out of 10 Australian kids report that their most recent harm was on YouTube,\u201d Wells told reporters, referring to government research. \u201cWe will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids.\u201d",

      "\u201cPlatforms have to provide an alternative to providing your own personal identification documents to satisfy themselves of age,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThese platforms know with deadly accuracy who we are, what we do and when we do it. And they know that you\u2019ve had a Facebook account since 2009, so they know that you are over 16.\"",

      "Rocketing to orbit from India, the satellite will survey virtually all of Earth\u2019s terrain multiple times. Its two radars \u2014 one from the U.S. and the other from India \u2014 will operate day and night, peering through clouds, rain and foliage to collect troves of data in extraordinary detail.",
      "Microwave signals beamed down to Earth from the dual radars will bounce back up to the satellite\u2019s super-sized antenna reflector perched at the end of a boom like a beach umbrella. Scientists will compare the incoming and outgoing signals as the spacecraft passes over the same locations twice every 12 days, teasing out changes as small as a fraction of an inch (1 centimeter).",
      "\u201cCongratulations India!\u201d India\u2019s minister of science and technology, Jitendra Singh, said via X once the satellite safely reached orbit. The mission \u201cwill benefit the entire world community.\u201d",

      "It will take a full week to extend the satellite\u2019s 30-foot (9-meter) boom and open the 39-foot-in-diameter (12-meter) drum-shaped reflector made of gold-plated wire mesh. Science operations should begin by the end of October.",

      "People with experimental brain implants often turn to the treatment as a last resort, hoping to improve their health when everything else has failed",
      "Carol Seeger finally escaped her debilitating depression with an experimental treatment that placed electrodes in her brain and a pacemaker-like device in her chest. But when its batteries stopped working, insurance wouldn\u2019t pay to fix the problem and she sank back into a dangerous darkness.",
      "She worried for her life, asking herself: \u201cWhy am I putting myself through this?\u201d",

Although these patients take big risks to advance science, there's no guarantee that their devices will be maintained \u2014 particularly after they finish participating in clinical trials \u2014 and no mechanism requiring companies or insurers to do so.",
      "A research project led by Gabriel L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz, a Harvard University scientist, aimed to change that by creating partnerships between players in the burgeoning implant field to overcome barriers to device access and follow-up care.",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Tech companies looking to sell their artificial intelligence technology to the federal government must now contend with a new regulatory hurdle: proving their chatbots aren't \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

Their ire centered on Google's February 2024 release of an AI image-generating tool that produced historically inaccurate images before the tech giant took down and fixed the product.",
      "Google later explained that the errors \u2014 including generating portraits of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show American Founding Fathers \u2014 were the result of an overcompensation for technology that, left to its own devices, was prone to favoring lighter-skinned people because of pervasive bias in the systems.",

      "U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, increased at a 3% annualized rate over three months ending in June. The figure marked a sharp acceleration from an annualized contraction of -0.5% over the first three months of 2025.",
      "The reading amounted to sturdy economic growth, suggesting the economy has continued to avert a significant tariff-induced cooldown. A boost in consumer spending helped propel the economic surge, the U.S. Commerce Department said.",
      "To some degree, however, Trump\u2019s levies have blurred the GDP findings.",
      "The government's GDP formula subtracts imports in an effort to exclude foreign production from the calculation of total goods and services. Changes in the reading on this account reveal neither underlying economic weakness nor strength.",
      "The measure of the GDP fell over the first three months of the year, largely due to a surge of imports as firms stockpiled inventory to avoid far-reaching tariffs. Conversely, a drop-off in imports over the second quarter may have inflated the second-quarter GDP figure.",
      "The GDP growth \"primarily reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP,\" the U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. economy so far has largely defied fears of a tariff-induced downturn.",
      "The unemployment rate stands near a historically low level and job growth remains robust, though it has slowed from previous highs. Inflation has climbed over the last two months but it remains below where it stood when Trump took office.",
      "In the months following Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, in April, consumer sentiment declined to its lowest level in years, raising concern about a possible pullback in consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity.",
      "Consumer sentiment has ticked up for two consecutive months, however, as Trump has rolled back some of his steepest tariffs. Consumer spending has proven fairly resilient.",

      "The University of California, Los Angeles, reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor whose lawsuit against the university argued it violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters in 2024 to block their access to classes and other areas on campus.",
      "The settlement comes nearly a year after a preliminary injunction was issued, marking the first time a U.S. judge had ruled against a university over their handling of on-campus demonstrations against Israel's war in Gaza.",
      "UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students\u2019 access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California, one of the nation\u2019s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests.",
      "How the university handled dispersing the encampment in the spring drew widespread criticism. One night, counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested.",
      "In March, the Trump administration joined the lawsuit filed by the Jewish students and Jewish professor as it opened new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at Columbia University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; Northwestern University and Portland State University.",
      "Last week, Columbia agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into alleged violations of federal antidiscrimination laws and restore more than $400 million in research grants.",
      "The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation for future agreements.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division found UCLA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u201cby acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.\u201d",

      "The university has said that it's committed to campus safety and will continue to implement recommendations.",
      "\"Today\u2019s settlement reflects a critically important goal that we share with the plaintiffs: to foster a safe, secure and inclusive environment for all members of our community and ensure that there is no room for antisemitism anywhere on campus,\u201d University of California Board of Regents Chair Janet Reilly said in a statement.",
      "As part of the settlement agreement, UCLA must ensure Jewish students, faculty and staff are not excluded from anything on-campus.",
      "The $6.13 million settlement will pay the plaintiffs' damages and legal fees. About $2.3 million will go to eight organizations that combat antisemitism, the university said.",
      "A group of 35 pro-Palestinian students, faculty members, legal observers, journalists and activists also has filed a lawsuit against UCLA, alleging the university failed to protect those who participated in the demonstrations. Some Jewish students have also taken part in protests on campuses around the country against Israel's war in Gaza.",
      "During the 2014 protests at UCLA, at least 15 pro-Palestinian protesters were injured and the tepid response by authorities drew criticism from political leaders as well as Muslim students and advocacy groups.",

      "Judge Lisa Cataldo didn't immediately rule Tuesday after hearing arguments on a defense motion seeking to dismiss the lawsuit because the state's two-year statute of limitations expired. Honolulu\u2019s claims are based on allegations that have been publicly known for decades, attorneys for the oil companies argue.",
      "In 2020, Hawaii's capital city sued major oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron, arguing they knew for nearly half a century that fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes the climate.

      "A prosecutor says a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife by poisoning her wanted out of their marriage but didn\u2019t want a divorce",
      "CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- A Colorado dentist carried a syringe into the hospital room where his wife was bedbound with a mysterious illness, and after he left, she rapidly deteriorated and eventually died, prosecutors said Tuesday.",

      "Prosecutor Michael Mauro and the defense wrapped up closing arguments Tuesday afternoon in the murder trial of James Craig in suburban Denver, and jurors began deliberating before pausing for the night with plans to resume Wednesday.",
      "Craig is accused of murdering his wife of 23 years by gradually poisoning her over 10 days in March 2023, putting her in the hospital where Craig allegedly gave her a fatal and final dose.",
      "One of Craig\u2019s attorneys, Lisa Fine Moses, fiercely pushed back in court. The photos from hospital security cameras of Craig holding a syringe, she said, were blurry and the needles that were recovered by investigators didn\u2019t contain poison.",
      "After Craig was arrested on suspicion of murder, he was further accused of offering to pay others to make it appear his wife, Angela Craig, was suicidal and asking a fellow jail inmate to kill the detective investigating his wife's death.",
      "Craig's motives in killing his wife, said Mauro, were to avoid the reputational and financial burden of divorce, cash in on life insurance and spend time with a woman with whom he was having an affair.",
      "Refuting suggestions that Angela Craig was suicidal, Mauro described her as resilient and hopeful. \u201cShe is the ultra-marathon runner of dealing with this man\u2019s betrayal,\" he said. \u201cBut she couldn\u2019t outrun it at University Hospital on March 15.\u201d",
      "Moses disputed the idea that Craig was in financial straits, saying they weren't late on bills and owned a pricey home. As for his cheating, Moses argued, it had been going on for years, was known to Angela Craig and had never been a motivation for murder before.",

      "Craig's defense attorneys didn't dispute that poison \u2014 cyanide and tetrahydrozoline \u2014 were found in Angela Craig's body, but that prosecutors failed to prove Craig had done it.",
      "Instead, Moses suggested Angela Craig was \u201cbroken\" by Craig's years of infidelity and may have taken her own life. She pointed to a journal entry where Angela Craig wrote in 2009: \u201cI feel depressed. I feel a huge sense of loss with no hope\u201d \u2014 and similar entries in 2018.",
      "As the entries were read, Craig wiped his nose and eyes with a tissue.",

The other proposed stop on Lai's itinerary was Dallas, Texas.",
      "Whatever the reason, the cancellation is certain to hand a major diplomatic victory to Beijing and has drawn concerns from experts that the White House is setting a bad precedent for U.S.-China relations.",

      "Another person with knowledge of the discussions said Beijing had sensed that it could ask President Donald Trump not to allow Lai to transit through the U.S. because of the perceived \u201cdesperation\u201d by Trump to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because they are in current sensitive discussions with administration officials. The White House said it had nothing to say on this matter. Tammy Bruce, spokesperson for the State Department, said it was a \u201chypothetical\u201d issue because Taiwan had not announced any travel plans for Lai.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of questions and a lot of suppositions that have happened,\" she told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cBut I can say that it is a hypothetical at this point. There have been no plans.\u201d",
      "By the end of last week it was clear that the Trump administration was discussing the likely transit by Lai, though it was unclear if the administration had moved to block it, according to one of the people.

      "Two weeks after spending the Fourth of July on a popular South Carolina lake, 12-year-old Jaysen Carr died from a brain-eating amoeba that was living in the warm water",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.",
      "His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia.",
      "They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.",
      "Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.",
      "As they grieve their son, the boy's parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn't closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn\u2019t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.",
      "\u201cI can't believe we don't have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else,\" Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child's heartbeat.",
      "Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.",
      "\u201cHe either loved you or he just didn't know you,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, \u2018This is my friend James.\u2019\u201d",
      "Friends invited Jaysen and his family for the Fourth of July holiday weekend on the lake, where Jaysen spent hours swimming, fishing and riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a boat.",
      "\u201cMom and Dad, that was the best Fourth of July I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Clarence Carr remembered his son telling him.",
      "A few days later, Jaysen's head started to hurt. Pain relievers helped. But the next day the headache got worse and he started throwing up. He told the emergency room doctors exactly where he was hurting. But soon he started to get disoriented and lethargic.",
      "The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.",
      "The amoeba caused an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Fewer than 10 people a year get it in the U.S., and over 95% of them die. The last death from the amoeba in South Carolina was in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba becomes dangerous in water that stays over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) and for years has been seen almost exclusively in the summer in the southern part of the country. But a few recent cases have popped up in Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota, scientists said.",
      "The CDC said 167 cases of the infection have been reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, and only four people have survived.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn't increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the CDC said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "Boys seem most susceptible, but researchers don't know if that is simply because they are more likely to jump and dive into the water or play in sediment at the bottom of lakes.",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That's why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",

      "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline a major Republican event in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline the latest iteration of an event previously billed as the largest annual gathering of Republicans in South Carolina, a state traditionally key to picking the GOP's presidential nominees, and one in which she already has deep relationships.",
      "Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina\u2019s 3rd District told The Associated Press that Sanders would be the featured speaker at her Salute to Liberty, slated to take place Aug. 18 in Anderson. In an interview last week, Biggs said she felt the governor \u201crepresents what the people in the 3rd District believe in, our morals, just down-to-earth hardworking people that love the Lord and want to live in peace with their families and uphold our conservative values.\u201d",
      "Historically a catalyst for Republican White House hopefuls, the South Carolina venue provides Sanders a chance to introduce herself to a large number \u2014 typically around 2,000 \u2014 of party activists. It\u2019s also a crowd with which President Donald Trump \u2014 whom she served as press secretary during his first administration \u2014 remains popular.",
      "Sanders, whose name comes up among potential 2028 presidential contenders, has been making trips to South Carolina since her father, former Arkansas governor and current U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, sought the 2008 GOP nomination. She's recently been in other early-voting states herself, including a speech earlier this month at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, an annual event held by a conservative Christian group.",
      "For years, the South Carolina occasion was billed as Rep. Jeff Duncan's Faith & Freedom BBQ, a fundraiser benefiting his reelection campaign. In a conservative-rich area, it became a showcase for future White House contenders, including then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott and Marco Rubio, and former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.",
      "The barbecue was upended just weeks after the 2023 event, when Duncan's wife filed for divorce, saying the congressman left her, was having a sexual relationship with a lobbyist and had been unfaithful before during their 35-year marriage. Last year, Duncan opted not to seek reelection to an eighth term, following the 2023 diminishment of his reputation for conservative family values.",
      "In her first political run, Biggs \u2014 a nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer \u2014 defeated a Trump-backed primary opponent last year. Mark Burns, a Black pastor who has been by Trump\u2019s side for nearly a decade, had unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.",

      "Biggs easily won the general election in the district, which has been in GOP hands since Republican Lindsey Graham, who is now seeking his fifth U.S. Senate term, won it in 1994. Six months into her first term, Biggs said that she knew she wanted a district-unifying event of her own, as well as one that could continue to act as a showcase for potential GOP presidential candidates seeking to get to know its voters.",
      "\u201cI do want people to know that I'm here to serve this district, and that means making myself available and being out front and accessible to our voters, and hearing their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm here to serve the district, and that doesn't just mean everybody who voted for me.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Biggs\u2019 event will be familiar.

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will hold three days of hearings on the fatal midair collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter",
      "WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board will hold three days of hearings starting Wednesday on January's midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter over the nation's capital that killed 67 people.",
      "The goal: Pinpoint exactly what went wrong and what can be done to avoid similar midair crashes between passenger planes and military aircraft. The accident was the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The hearings in Washington will involve NTSB board members, investigators and witnesses. Panels will focus on military helicopter routes in the Washington area, collision avoidance technology and training for air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan National Airport, among other subjects.",
      "NTSB officials have already said the FAA failed to recognize a concerning pattern after there were 85 near misses in Washington airspace in just three years. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "Investigators have also said that the Army helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.",
      "Meanwhile, federal officials have raised concerns over the nation's overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system. During January's mid-air crash above Washington, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "The hearings come at a time of heightened scrutiny of the safety of air travel amid the growing list of aircraft tragedies, mishaps and near misses in 2025. They include an Air India plane crash in June that killed at least 260 people as well as two unrelatedclose calls in the U.S. this month in which passenger jets took evasive action to avoid military planes.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the crash, the investigation so far and other notable aircraft incidents this year.",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members as it approached to land on a clear night at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an emergency.",
      "Investigators have said the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The FAA has since permanently banned that particular helicopter route when planes are using that runway.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn\u2019t see the plane.",
      "Controllers approved the request roughly 20 seconds before the collision.",
      "The NTSB has said there were 85 dangerous close calls between planes and helicopters near Reagan National in the three years before the crash, and collision alarms had been ordering pilots to take evasive action at least once a month since 2011.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters in February that the Black Hawk\u2019s cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet. She said the crew was unable to hear the words \u201cpass behind the\u201d because its microphone key was pressed.",
      "The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",

      "Jul 29, 12:54 PM",
      "Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicate that the crew may not have had accurate altitude readings, with the helicopter\u2019s pilot calling out that they were at 300 feet (91 meters) but the instructor pilot saying 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.",
      "That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter\u2019s black box captures its radio altitude.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "January\u2019s crash prompted the Federal Aviation Administration in March to announce that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred.",
      "However, concerns over Washington\u2019s airspace have persisted. On May 1, military air traffic controllers lost contact with an Army helicopter for about 20 seconds as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings. After that incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims\u2019 families.",
      "Others included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas; four members of a steamfitters\u2019 union in suburban Maryland; nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia; and two Chinese nationals.",
      "Besides the midair collision above Washington, a string of other recent crashes have brought attention to air travel, which remains overwhelmingly safe. The crashes include:",
      "On Jan. 31 a medical transport jet crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven.",
      "On Feb. 6 a small commuter aircraft went down off western Alaska, killing 10.",
      "On Feb. 17, a Delta plane crashed and flipped over upon landing in Toronto but everyone survived. Two small planes collided in midair in Arizona on Feb. 19, killing two people.",
      "On April 10, a New York City sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and crashed upside-down into the Hudson River, killing the pilot and a family of five Spanish tourists.",
      "On April 11, three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed in Boca Raton, Florida.",
      "The crash of the Air India passenger plane in June occurred in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad, killing more than 240 people bound for London and others on the ground, officials said. A single passenger survived. The same month, a small plane crashed off the San Diego coast shortly after takeoff, killing all six people on board.",
      "July included at least three fatal plane crashes. Two student pilots died when their single-engine planes crashed in midair south of Steinbach, in the Canadian province of Manitoba. A small plane crashed shortly after taking off from London Southend Airport, killing four people. A North Carolina family of four, including two school-age children, died when their small plane crashed as they flew back from Florida.",

      "The Senate has confirmed former Trump lawyer Emil Bove for a lifetime appointment as a federal appeals court judge",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed former Trump lawyer Emil Bove 50-49 for a lifetime appointment as a federal appeals court judge Tuesday as Republicans dismissed whistleblower complaints about his conduct at the Justice Department.",
      "A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on Trump\u2019s legal team during his New York hush money trial and defended Trump in the two federal criminal cases. He will serve on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.",
      "Democrats have vehemently opposed Bove\u2019s nomination, citing his current position as a top Justice Department official and his role in the dismissal of the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. They have also criticized his efforts to investigate department officials who were involved in the prosecutions of hundreds of Trump supporters who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "Bove has accused FBI officials of \u201cinsubordination\u201d for refusing to hand over the names of agents who investigated the attack and ordered the firing of a group of prosecutors involved in those Jan. 6 criminal cases.",
      "Democrats have also cited evidence from whistleblowers, a fired department lawyer who said last month that Bove had suggested the Trump administration may need to ignore judicial commands \u2014 a claim that Bove denies \u2014 and new evidence from a whistleblower who did not go public. That whistleblower recently provided an audio recording of Bove that runs contrary to some of his testimony at his confirmation hearing last month, according to two people familiar with the recording.",
      "The audio is from a private video conference call at the Department of Justice in February in which Bove, a top official at the department, discussed his handling of the dismissed case against Adams, according to transcribed quotes from the audio reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the whistleblower has not made the recording public. The whistleblower\u2019s claims were first reported by the Washington Post.",
      "None of that evidence has so far been enough to sway Senate Republicans \u2014 all but two of them voted to confirm Bove as GOP senators have deferred to Trump on virtually all of his picks.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that Bove's confirmation is a \u201cdark day\u201d and that Republicans are only supporting Bove because of his loyalty to the president.",
      "\u201cIt's unfathomable that just over four years after the insurrection at the Capitol, when rioters smashed windows, ransacked offices, desecrated this chamber, Senate Republicans are willingly putting someone on the bench who shielded these rioters from facing justice, who said their prosecution was a grave national injustice,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against Bove's confirmation. \u201cI don\u2019t think that somebody who has counseled other attorneys that you should ignore the law, you should reject the law, I don\u2019t think that that individual should be placed in a lifetime seat on the bench,\u201d Murkowski said Tuesday.",
      "At his confirmation hearing last month, Bove addressed criticism of his tenure head-on, telling lawmakers he understands some of his decisions \u201chave generated controversy.\u201d But Bove said he has been inaccurately portrayed as Trump\u2019s \u201chenchman\u201d and \u201cenforcer\u201d at the department.",
      "In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee released Tuesday evening just before the vote, Bove said he does not have the whistleblower\u2019s recording but is \u201cundeterred by this smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Senators at the Judiciary Committee hearing asked Bove about the February 14 call with lawyers in the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section, which had received significant public attention because of his unusual directive that the attorneys had an hour to decide among themselves who would agree to file on the department\u2019s behalf the motion to dismiss the case against Adams.",

      "The call was convened amid significant upheaval in the department as prosecutors in New York who\u2019d handled the matter, as well as some in Washington, resigned rather than agree to dispense with the case.",
      "According to the transcript of the February call, Bove remarked near the outset that interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon \u201cresigned about ten minutes before we were going to put her on leave pending an investigation.\u201d But when asked at the hearing whether he had opened the meeting by emphasizing that Sassoon and another prosecutor had refused to follow orders and that Sassoon was going to be reassigned before she resigned, Bove answered with a simple, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Bove defended his testimony as accurate, noting that the transcript of the call shows he didn\u2019t use the word \u201creassigned\u201d when talking to the prosecutors.",
      "At another moment, Bove said he did not recall saying words that the transcript of the call reflects him as having said \u2014 that whoever signed the motion to dismiss the Adams case would emerge as leaders of the section.",
      "But in the letter to Grassley, Bove said he did not intend to suggest that anyone would be rewarded for submitting the memo but rather that doing so would reflect a willingness to follow the chain of command, something he said was the \u201cbare minimum required of mid-level management\u201d of a government agency.",
      "Grassley said Tuesday that he believes Bove will be a \u201cdiligent, capable and fair jurist.\u201d",
      "He said his staff had tried to investigate the claims but that lawyers for the whistleblowers would not give them all of the materials they had asked for until Tuesday, hours before the vote. The \u201cvicious rhetoric, unfair accusations and abuse directed at Mr. Bove\u201d have \u201ccrossed the line,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "The first whistleblower complaint against Bove came from a former Justice Department lawyer who was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison.",
      "That lawyer, Erez Reuveni, described efforts by top Justice Department officials in the weeks before his firing to stonewall and mislead judges to carry out deportations championed by the White House.",
      "Reuveni described a Justice Department meeting in March concerning Trump\u2019s plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act over what the president claimed was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Reuveni said Bove raised the possibility that a court might block the deportations before they could happen. Reuveni claims Bove used a profanity in saying the department would need to consider telling the courts what to do and \u201cignore any such order,\u201d Reuveni\u2019s lawyers said in the filing.",
      "Bove said he has \u201cno recollection of saying anything of that kind.\u201d",

      "Federal judges are weighing a request to require Alabama to submit its next congressional map for preclearance",
      "Federal judges on Tuesday sharply questioned lawyers on a request to make Alabama subject again to the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act after courts ruled the state intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents.",
      "Black voters and civil rights organizations, who brought a lawsuit that gave Alabama a new congressional map, are asking a three-judge panel to require any new congressional plans drawn in the next seven years go through federal review. The Alabama attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice oppose the request.",
      "The Voting Rights Act for decades required states with a history of discrimination \u2014 including many in the South \u2014 to get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. But the requirement of preclearance effectively went away in 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the provision determining which states are covered was outdated and unconstitutional.",
      "The request is seeking to trigger the \u201cbail-in\u201d provision of the Voting Rights Act. Alternatively, plaintiffs are asking the court to retain jurisdiction so any new plans can be addressed.",
      "Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said Alabama demonstrated a pattern of resistance to drawing a congressional map that was fair to Black voters. He said the preclearance is needed to ensure Alabama doesn\u2019t \u201cbackslide\u201d the next time maps are drawn.",
      "\u201cThere is no question what happened in this case extraordinary,\u201d Ross told the panel.",
      "He pointed to the history of the case, including that lawmakers in 2023 \u201cintentionally defied\u201d a court order to draw a second majority-Black district or something close to it. Judges stepped in to select a new map for the state that was used in the 2024 elections.",
      "Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour Jr. argued to the court that preclearance is an extraordinary remedy that is only appropriate after multiple violations.",
      "\u201cThat test is not satisfied here,\u201d LaCour told the panel.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed revoking a scientific finding that's long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday proposed revoking a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.",
      "The proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule would rescind a 2009 declaration that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The \u201cendangerment finding\u201d is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.",
      "Repealing the finding \u201cwill be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" Zeldin said on the conservative \u201cRuthless\u201d podcast. \"They created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.\u201d",
      "The EPA proposal must go though a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year. Environmental groups are likely to challenge the rule change in court.",
      "Zeldin called for a rewrite of the endangerment finding in March as part of a series of environmental rollbacks announced at the same time in what he said was \"the greatest day of deregulation in American history.'' A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin's plan.",
      "Under the Obama and Biden administrations, his predecessors at EPA \u201ctwisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,'' Zeldin said Tuesday at an event in Indiana announcing the proposed rule change.",
      "The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles, a rule Trump incorrectly labels an EV \u201cmandate.\u201d The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.",
      "Environmental groups said Zeldin's action seeks to deny reality even as weather disasters exacerbated by climate change grow worse in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "\u201cAs Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,'' said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIt boggles the mind and endangers the nation\u2019s safety and welfare.\u201d",
      "Under Zeldin and Trump, \u201cthe EPA wants to shirk its responsibility to protect us from climate pollution, but science and the law say otherwise,'' she added. \u201cIf EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\u201d",
      "Three former EPA leaders have also criticized Zeldin, saying his March announcement targeting the endangerment finding and other rules imperiled the lives of millions of Americans and abandoned the agency\u2019s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.",

Bush, said after Zeldin's plan was made public.",
      "The EPA proposal follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report \u201con the legality and continuing applicability\u201d of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans hailed the plan, calling it a way to undo economically damaging rules to regulate greenhouse gases.",
      "But environmental groups, legal experts and Democrats said any attempt to repeal or roll back the endangerment finding would be an uphill task with slim chance of success. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.",
      "The EPA proposal \u201cseeks to deny settled science by creating legal distinctions that have no basis in the law,\u201d said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice. Rather than take seriously its responsibility to protect public health, \u201cthe Trump administration is pretending that the pollution causing climate change is not hurting us, even as we suffer more devastating climate disasters every year,\" she said.",
      "If finalized, repeal of the endangerment finding would erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to tackle climate change.",
      "\u201cThe endangerment finding is built on a rock-solid scientific foundation that has gotten even stronger over time,\" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. The finding \u201chas supported commonsense solutions that reduce pollution, give us cleaner air and protect our health and our jobs,\u201d he said.",
      "Climate scientists warned that overturning the endangerment finding would undermine decades of scientific progress and damage the credibility of U.S. institutions tasked with protecting the environment. The 12 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2009, and heat-related deaths are rising while wildfires are now more frequent and severe, said Scott Saleska, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.",
      "\u201cTo repeal the endangerment finding now would be like a driver who is speeding towards a cliff taking his foot off the brake and instead pressing the accelerator,\u201d Saleska said.",
      "Jim Walsh, policy director of the environmental group Food & Water Watch, used a more explosive metaphor. \u201cLee Zeldin\u2019s assertion that the EPA shouldn\u2019t address greenhouse gas emissions is like a fire chief claiming they shouldn\u2019t fight fires,'' he said. \u201cIt is as malicious as it is absurd.\"",

      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated star of \"The English Patient\" and \"Slow Horses\" has directed and co-written her first film: the heartfelt \"My Mother's Wedding,\" about three daughters who come together to attend their mom's third nuptials \u2013 a story inspired by Thomas' own childhood losses.",
    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all! Keep it coming!'\"",

    "summary": "It took the art world decades to recognize Louise Nevelson, whose monochromatic and immersive sculptures, often incorporating found objects, verged on the monumental.",
    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gdp-report-second-quarter-2025-commerce-department/",
    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:09:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when it fell 0.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace the GDP was forecast to grow for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a surprising turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with a growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is, however, still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "One measure of the economy's underlying strength tucked into the GDP report is the \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories, and net exports. That number rose at a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022. When considered alongside the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the 1.9% in the first quarter of this year, this quarter's number indicates that demand from consumers and businesses is dampening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, a North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" given the fact that it was largely driven by a 30% slump in imports after President Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "The latest data shows that in the second quarter that trend started to shift with a large drop in imports and a rise in exports \u2014 signaling that the United States is closing the trade gap President Trump has repeatedly cited as the basis for his tariff policy.",
      "Still, experts say there's more to the data than what meets the eye. If you combine the 3% growth rate in GDP in the second quarter with the 0.5% decline in first-quarter, the average growth rate for the first six months of 2025 is 1.25%.",
      "In a note shared yesterday before the GDP report, Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research, suggested that number would be  \"exceptionally weak\" when stacked up against 2024's average growth rate which was 2.8%.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "While the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy is still humming along, albeit at a slower rate.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing their spending, but not halting it completely. \"Personal spending growth will remain subdued as the labor market loses momentum and the real income shock from tariffs takes fuller form,\" he said.",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a note that while it's difficult to get a full read on the economy, it's clear that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter of 2025.",
      "Another indicator on the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is likely to hold rates steady this time around, although a cut could come in September. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release the jobs report Friday, which will give Americans a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",

    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about three-quarters of middle-income consumers saying they're cutting back on non-essential purchases, according to a recent\u00a0survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "About one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage in the past year, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon.

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",

      "The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

      "The parent company of brands like Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot announced the projected earnings hit as Mr. Trump clinches deals with U.S. trade partners that include steep tariffs on U.S. imports. Stellantis expects most of the earnings decline to materialize in the second half of 2025.",
      "\"Stellantis updates its estimate of 2025 net tariff impact to approximately \u20ac1.5 billion, of which \u20ac0.3 billion was incurred in H1 2025. The Company remains highly engaged with relevant policymakers, while continuing long-term scenario planning,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday as it reported financial results for the first half of 2025.",
      "The automaker acknowledged that Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts to the U.S. are hurting its business, particularly in North America. Stellantis builds its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles in factories in Canada and Mexico, meaning they're subject to the new levies.",
      "While Mr. Trump's deal with the EU, calling for 15% tariffs across the board will make BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles more expensive for U.S. consumers, according to analysts. Stellantis is largely unaffected by the EU agreement.",
      "\"Stellantis isn't much affected by the EU/US tariff news \u2014 the question for STLA is if the Detroit-3 will want to renegotiate the [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)] tariff after the EU and Japan got a better deal,\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "Other automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, have been bracing for impact from tariffs. GM CEO Mary Barra said the company took a $1.1 billion hit from tariffs in the second quarter, and that the company is taking steps to reduce its tariff exposure by investing in U.S. assembly plants.",
      "European automaker Volkswagen also said last week that tariffs cost the company $1.5 billion in the first half of 2025.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",

    "summary": "A dating advice app that lets women anonymously review their dates and compare notes has surged in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Trump administration setting 15% as a floor for tariffs, companies and economists are warning of higher prices later this year.",
    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",
      "Orange juice importer Johanna Foods has gone a step further, this week filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its proposed\u00a050% tariff on Brazil, which the New Jersey company said would seriously hurt its business and force it to hike product prices by up to 25%.",
      "The White House disputes that higher U.S. tariffs will drive up costs for businesses and consumers.",
      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files using a little-known law that directs executive agencies to turn over information to congressional oversight committees, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday.",
      "\"Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, and he proceeded to describe the nearly century-old law the minority would use to try to compel the release of the \"full and complete Epstein files.\"",
      "The federal law, known as Section 2954 and referred to as the \"Rule of Five,\" allows five members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs to submit an information request on matters within its jurisdiction to a federal agency. Enacted in 1928, the obscure law is part of Congress' ability to wield influence over executive branch agencies, and gives minority members of the oversight committees the ability to request information without the help of the committee chairman.",
      "The move comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent weeks, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters. The review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019, had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has divided Mr. Trump's base, with many in both parties calling for more transparency as the president has called the controversy a \"hoax.\" And Democrats have sought to capitalize on the GOP infighting.",
      "\"The situation with the Epstein files is very simple \u2014 Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,\" Schumer said. \"As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so.\"",
      "Schumer accused Republicans of choosing to \"hide\" on the Epstein files, saying, \"if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?\"",
      "The rule has rarely been used. In 2017, Democrats tried to force the release of documents relating to the leasing of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which became the site of a Trump hotel. And in 2001, Democrats under former President George W. Bush attempted to compel documents about the 2000 census. Still, with infrequent use, whether the rule could be enforced in court remains to be seen.",
      "Schumer said the request covers \"all documents, files, evidence or other materials in the possession of the Department of Justice or the FBI related to the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein.\" He noted the request includes records related to Epstein and his clients, while \"ensuring that the private information of any victims is protected.\" The minority leader said the Democrats expect the Justice Department to provide the information by Aug. 15.",

      "President Trump announced Wednesday the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",

      "Dr. Vinay Prasad, the controversial FDA vaccine official who had been critical of the agency's moves to greenlight COVID-19 boosters, has left the agency, the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family,\" HHS said. \"We thank him for his service and the many important reforms he was able to achieve in his time at FDA.\"",
      "Prasad had been serving as the FDA's director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research since May, replacing Dr. Peter Marks, who had been forced out by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Prasad was subsequently named chief medical and scientific officer, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "In recent weeks, right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had launched a social media campaign against Prasad, highlighting his past support for Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders. Loomer called Prasad a \"Lifelong Progressive with a Vicious Anti-Trump Record\" and writing that \"Prasad's views are a slap in the face to the conservative values of limited government, deregulation, and economic freedom that YOU voted for!\"",
      "But FDA chief Marty Markay over the weekend had defended Prasad over Loomer's comments, saying in a Politico podcast that Prasad is a \"impeccable scientist \u2026 one of the greatest scientific minds of our generation.\"",
      "Long a critic of the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, Prasad had called Marks \"one of the most dangerous, pro-pharma regulators of the 21st century\" and said he was \"either incompetent or corrupt to authorize a booster without clinical, randomized data.\"",
      "In his three-month tenure at the FDA, the agency decided to limit COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to people 65 years of age and older and others who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill if they are infected, and will require manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to show whether the vaccines are of benefit to healthy younger adults and children.",

    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at today's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "In their zeal to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" Trump administration officials are making statements that some advocacy and medical groups say depict patients and the doctors who treat them as partly responsible for whatever ails them.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and agency leaders have attributed a panoply of chronic diseases and other medical issues \u2014 such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, diabetes, and obesity \u2014 to consumers and their lifestyle choices, according to a review of 15 hours of recorded interviews, social media statements, and federal reports.",

      "\"These are kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date,\" he said. \"Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\"",
      "The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.",
      "The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to COVID-19 vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.",
      "\"This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,\" said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. \"It's these two extreme views. It's every health decision is up to the 'rugged individual,' versus the other extreme view that it's all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it's on a continuum.\"",
      "The blame game",
      "Self-reliance is a common theme among adherents of MAHA, an informal movement for which Kennedy has fashioned himself the figurehead that promotes medical freedom, skepticism of vaccines, and a focus on nontraditional medicine to treat disease.",
      "Taking medication to manage diabetes? FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested on Fox News in late May that it would be effective to \"treat more diabetes with cooking classes\" instead of \"just throwing insulin at people.\"",
      "People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their pancreases don't produce it, according to the National Institutes of Health, which also notes that many with Type 2 diabetes \"need to take diabetes medicines as well.\"",
      "Taking birth control pills? Casey Means, President Trump's nominee to be U.S. surgeon general, has said that's a \"disrespect of life\" for short-term gain and efficiency.",
      "\"We are prescribing them like candy,\" she said last year on \"The Tucker Carlson Show,\" adding that birth control medications \"are literally shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical, life-giving nature of women.\"",
      "Have a child on ADHD meds? Calley Means, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means' brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they're in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.",
      "As a society, he said, \"we're really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we're normalizing that and we're not speaking out about that. And then we're giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.\"",
      "Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a methamphetamine-based drug administered to Adolf Hitler's forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that's not the same as methamphetamine.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to messages seeking comment from Means.",
      "Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.",
      "The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it's harder to get outside and exercise.",
      "Jerome Adams, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by \"the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.\"",
      "Tough talk",
      "The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.",
      "Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.",
      "For example, the Biden administration proposed a rule in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.",
      "\"I think it's very dark,\" Calley Means told Carlson, referring to the weight loss drugs. \"I think it's a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.\"",
      "He added: \"Where is the urgency on saying 'Hey parents, maybe we shouldn't feed our kids toxic food?'\"",
      "Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on Fox News that drugmakers \"are counting on selling it to Americans because we're so stupid and so addicted to drugs.\"",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.",
      "\"It's impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,\" said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. \"It sends the message that it's your fault. It's very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren't individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.\"",
      "Kennedy and HHS didn't return messages seeking comment.",
      "Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the highest dose of Zepbound in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.",
      "Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many COVID-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed COVID risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said that people who died from COVID actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.",
      "\"That's really what killed them,\" Kennedy said on \"Dr. Phil Primetime\" in April. \"These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and COVID came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.\"",
      "COVID was the underlying cause of death for more than 940,000 people in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.",
      "COVID ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID compared with older children, studies show, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.",
      "\"Vaccination during pregnancy can help protect infants after birth,\" according to the CDC.",
      "But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don't work and thereby drain resources from the program.",
      "At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of \"all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.\"",
      "It's a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.",
      "\"Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they're going to now have to go get a job,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.",
      "The legislation, which Mr. Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.",
      "Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.",
      "Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, according to KFF, the health policy organization that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"It's using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,\" said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage. He summarized the Republican message: \"We're going to make it harder to get the help you need by imposing a bunch of paperwork, and if you don't get it, it's your fault.\"",

    "summary": "The EPA has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"",
      "Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "During his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.",
      "\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.",
      "But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.",
      "Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.",
      "\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"",
      "Legality of the endangerment finding",
      "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.",
      "Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.",
      "\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.",
      "\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" they told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"",
      "The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.",
      "The release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with\u00a0a study\u00a0from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which was not peer-reviewed, but says greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"",
      "Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.",
      "\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.",
      "The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.",
      "The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.",
      "\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"",
      "Impacts of the endangerment finding",
      "Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.",
      "New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.",
      "But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.",
      "In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.",
      "\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 22:06:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Emil Bove was one of President Trump's defense lawyers before joining the Justice Department earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday approved the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer, to serve on a U.S. appeals court, confirming the controversial nominee to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench.",
      "The upper chamber voted 50-49 to green-light Bove's nomination to the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, which oversees cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined all Democrats in voting no.",
      "\"He has a strong legal background and has served his country honorably. I believe he will be diligent, capable and a fair jurist,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said of Bove on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Bove emerged as Mr. Trump's most controversial judicial pick so far, and former judges, prosecutors and other Justice Department employees had urged senators to reject his nomination. A Justice Department whistleblower alleged that Bove had suggested government lawyers should ignore court orders, prompting Democrats to unsuccessfully push for the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay a vote on his nomination. When the panel voted earlier this month to advance his nomination, all of the panel's Democrats walked out of the meeting in protest.",
      "Two more whistleblowers have since turned over information about Bove to either the Justice Department's internal watchdog or lawmakers, according to the organization Whistleblower Aid, which represents one of the people, and the Washington Post, which reported on evidence given to Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "Booker and Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked the Justice Department's acting inspector general on Monday whether he has launched any investigations related to Bove and said the allegations of misconduct are \"troubling.\"",
      "Bove was one of the lawyers who represented the president in his criminal cases and he joined the Justice Department as principal associate deputy attorney general when Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term. Bove also served briefly as acting deputy attorney general in the opening weeks of the second Trump administration until the Senate confirmed Todd Blanche, also a former defense lawyer for the president, to the No. 2 spot.",
      "But former Justice Department prosecutors accused Bove of executing mass firings at the department of employees who were \"perceived not to show sufficient loyalty\" to Mr. Trump, including officials who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into the president, which yielded two prosecutions that have since been dropped.",
      "Bove was also at the center of a controversy involving the Justice Department's decision to drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for cooperation with immigration enforcement. Several prosecutors who worked on Adams' case resigned after Bove directed them to dismiss the charges against the mayor and said the move appeared to be a quid pro quo.",
      "But Bove brushed away the accusations, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that the decision to drop the five-count indictment against Adams was within the scope of prosecutorial discretion. He also said Adams' own submissions to the court refute the allegations of an \"improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Bove also faced allegations of unethical conduct from a fired Justice Department lawyer, who filed a whistleblower report with lawmakers last month. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, claimed Bove suggested that the administration should ignore court orders regarding the administration's efforts to remove migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Reuveni alleged that during a March meeting with senior department officials about removal flights, Bove suggested that the department would need to consider telling the courts to \"f**k you\" if a judge blocked deportations under the 1798 law.",
      "Emails and text messages that Reuveni provided to senators include exchanges with a Justice Department colleague in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding judicial orders.",
      "A second Justice Department whistleblower submitted documents to the department's internal watchdog that supports Reuveni's claims, according to the organization Whistleblower Aid, which is representing the lawyer.",
      "Reuveni worked at the Justice Department for nearly 15 years and had been promoted to acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation in March. But he was fired in April after telling a federal judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was deported to his home country in March, should not have been removed. An immigration official with the Trump administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee attempted to push the panel to delay the vote to advance Bove's nomination and allow Reuveni to testify, but Grassley rejected the move.",
      "The White House and Justice Department have defended Bove and claimed that Reuveni was a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Grassley lambasted Democrats for their handling of Bove's nomination and said they have tried to obstruct nearly all of Mr. Trump's nominees.",
      "\"The vicious rhetoric, unfair accusations and abuse directed at Mr. Bove by some on this committee, it has crossed the line,\" he said.",
      "Blanche wrote in an op-ed for Fox News that Bove is \"the most capable and principled lawyer I have ever known,\" and said his \"legal acumen is extraordinary and his moral clarity is above reproach.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 20:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "From vaccines to fluoride, here's what the newly confirmed CDC director Susan Monarez has said about some key health topics.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday along party lines, 51 to 47, to confirm Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "President Trump nominated her for the role in March, praising her as \"an incredible mother and dedicated public servant\" who \"understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future.\"",
      "Monarez has been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January, and previously worked as the head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. She was viewed as somewhat surprising pick for the CDC role because unlike most recent CDC directors, she holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor.",
      "The CDC\u00a0said\u00a0Monarez \"brings decades of distinguished experience in health innovation, disaster preparedness, global health, and biosecurity\" to the agency, and will help advance the \"mission to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committee on July 9, Monarez garnered praise from the Republican chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is a physician, for her commitment to rebuilding public trust in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats on the committee grilled her about the impact of cuts in federal funding for health programs and medical research, and expressed concern about the CDC's role under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Monarez was questioned by committee members about a range of health topics. Here are some of those highlights.",
      "Monarez on vaccines",
      "Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations.\u00a0Kennedy\u00a0has been a longtime vaccine critic who has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and stated that she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "Amid a growing measles outbreak this year, Kennedy has\u00a0acknowledged the vaccine's efficacy\u00a0against the disease while still saying he supports individual choice. In a March interview with CBS News, Kennedy publicly encouraged people to get the measles vaccine.",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to supporting the secretary with science and evidence, and making sure that I am giving him the best information possible,\" Monarez said at her confirmation hearing. \"Measles is an important health threat and we have to make sure we are doing everything that we can to prevent and mitigate it.\"",
      "Monarez was also asked about the continued availability and affordability of vaccines if the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, made up of new RFK Jr. appointees, makes changes to recommendations.",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" she said.",
      "Monarez on fluoride",
      "Fluoride, another topic Kennedy has spotlighted, was also a subject of discussion during Monarez's hearing. This year, two states, Utah and Florida, became the first to ban the use of fluoride in drinking water, where it's been added for decades to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "\"Fluoride is an important component to oral health, and there are various aspects of using fluoride to improve oral health \u2014 a direct application can be very valuable,\" Monarez said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland specifically asked Monarez whether the water in Potomac, Maryland, which has fluoridation, is safe for families.",
      "Monarez replied: \"I believe the water in Potomac, Maryland is safe.\"",
      "Monarez on RFK Jr. and the measles outbreak",
      "Measles came up repeatedly as senators questioned Monarez about how she would interact with Kennedy in her role at the CDC.",
      "\"The CDC director can't perform this critical role unless they are politically independent. Which means that you must be willing to disagree with political leaders based on scientific evidence,\" Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said. \"So, is there anything that you disagree with Secretary Kennedy about?\"",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to having technical discussions with the secretary. He has said he values and prioritizes independent thinking and using science to drive decision making,\" Monarez replied. \"I am an independent thinker, and I am a scientist, and I will welcome the opportunity to share my opinions based on science and evidence with him as he makes some of these very difficult decisions.\"",
      "After Monarez sidestepped a question from Hassan about whether she disagrees with anything Kennedy has done, the senator got more specific, asking about Kennedy's claim that it's \"very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person.\" This year's measles outbreak, centered in West Texas, killed two children who doctors said did not have previous health conditions.",
      "Monarez replied that measles is an \"important public health threat\" that can be lethal.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Monday filed a misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg, who has sparred with the Trump administration for months over its deportations of Venezuelan men to El Salvador.",
      "The complaint accuses Boasberg of \"making improper public comments about President Trump and his Administration,\" according to a copy obtained by CBS News. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, to file the complaint, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "In the complaint, Mizelle cites Boasberg's attendance at a Judicial Conference of the United States on March 11, in which the judge warned that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts\" and trigger a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Mizelle also cites Boasberg's handling of a case involving alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who were flown to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year. Boasberg ordered the planes to turn around on March 15, after the Trump administration removed the men under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg subsequently held hearings in the case in which he has lambasted the conduct of Justice Department attorneys and questioned whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith to guarantee due process for those it has removed from the U.S. or intends to remove.",
      "\"Throughout the proceedings, Judge Boasberg rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond and threatening criminal-contempt proceedings and the appointment of an outside prosecutor against senior Trump Administration officials for failing to comply with an order that had already been vacated,\" Mizelle wrote.",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X that the judge's remarks \"have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that.\"",
      "The complaint was addressed to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Sri Srinivasan. Typically, complaints about judges are first reviewed by the chief judge of the appellate circuit, who can either dismiss them or refer them to a committee for investigation. After that, a council of judges decides whether to take corrective action, which can include reprimanding the judge and avoiding assigning new cases.",
      "Judges can only be removed from the bench through impeachment proceedings, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote to remove them.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration filed a similar complaint against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes for what they claimed was \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" during a hearing in February over the Trump administration's attempts to ban transgender servicemembers from the military. The D.C. Circuit has not yet addressed the Reyes complaint.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Boasberg's chambers for comment.",
      "Boasberg accuses Trump administration of \"obstructionism\"",
      "In April, Boasberg said there was probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of his order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "Dozens were put on two planes on March 15, removed to El Salvador and placed in detention at CECOT, a maximum security prison, despite an order issued by Boasberg to stop the removals and turn around the planes.",
      "Boasberg said in his April decision that the government's actions \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the Alien Enemies Act, which previously had been invoked only three times in history, while the nation was at war.",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "Boasberg's handling of the case has drawn pushback from the administration. In March, Mr. Trump called the judge \"Crooked\" and called for his impeachment.",

      "Last week, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, to sit for a deposition as fallout over the Trump administration's handling of the case continues to intensify. A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence.",
      "However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump.",
      "\"Public reports \u2014 including your own statements \u2014 indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Markus wrote.",
      "Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to \"ensure accuracy and fairness,\" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create \"security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, \"any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool.\"",
      "However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, \"she would be willing\u2014and eager\u2014to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell \"will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter \"soon,\" but said it \"will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.\"",
      "In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25\u00a0 to discuss Epstein.",
      "After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is \"allowed\" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.",
      "Trump says Epstein \"stole\" employees from him \u2014 possibly including Virginia Giuffre",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he cut ties with Epstein in the early 2000s because the financier \"stole\" employees from his business \u2014 reiterating his comments from a day earlier.",
      "The president said the workers in question were young women who worked in the spa at Mar-A-Lago. Asked whether Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre was one of the employees, Mr. Trump said, \"I think that was one of the people.\"",
      "Giuffre has alleged in civil court\u00a0that she was a 16-year-old employee at Mar-A-Lago when Maxwell first met her and \"recruited\" her \"into Epstein's sex trafficking activities.\" Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide earlier this year\u00a0\u2014 was among the most prominent people to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Mr. Trump noted Tuesday that Giuffre \"had no complaints about us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was friends with Epstein for years before their relationship ended in the 2000s. In the past, the White House has said the president \"kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a creep.\" Asked Tuesday about whether Epstein was cut off for being a \"creep\" or for stealing employees, Mr. Trump said, \"maybe they're the same thing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey sparred with fellow Democrats on Tuesday over a bipartisan policing package, accusing them of being \"complicit\" in President Trump's agenda in a rare moment of intraparty disagreement that played out on the Senate floor.",
      "The heated exchange arose after Booker objected to a motion from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, to swiftly pass a package of bills related to law enforcement. Booker said he wanted to make a change to the bloc of measures to ensure resources are distributed equally among law enforcement agencies in response to the Justice Department's changes to grant programs and cancellation of awards.",
      "\"We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we're willing to go along with that today,\" he said. \"No, no. Not on my watch. I stand against this. It is a violation of our Constitution for the president of the United States to ignore the will of Congress and decide which states are eligible for grants and which are not.\"",
      "Booker accused Cortez Masto and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who backs the legislative package, of lecturing him.",
      "\"What I am tired of is when the president of the United States violates the Constitution, trashes our norms and traditions and what does the Democratic Party do? Comply? Allow him? Beg for scraps? No. I demand justice,\" he said.",
      "Booker said the Democratic Party \"needs a wake-up call.\"",
      "\"It's time for Democrats to have a backbone. It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw lines,\" he said, as his voice started rising. \"Don't question my integrity. Don't question my motives.\"",
      "Booker said in his remarks from the Senate floor that the Justice Department has been weaponizing public safety grants to punish state and local jurisdictions that oppose Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, and it is withholding funds from law enforcement agencies across the country when they were approved by Congress with bipartisan backing.",
      "\"It is disgraceful, it is unfair, it is unjust and it is dangerously reckless toward the officers whose well-being they are jeopardizing,\" Booker said. \"Federal funds should not be used for partisan political gains.\"",
      "The New Jersey Democrat lambasted his colleagues and accused them of effectively blessing Mr. Trump's decision to rescind grant funds by approving the legislative package.",
      "\"For us as a body to move forward right now is being complicit in what Donald Trump is doing,\" Booker said. \"I say no. I say we stand. I say we fight. I say we reject this, and that in a bipartisan way, we demand an end to this kind of constitutionally unjust carving up of the resources we approve.\"",
      "Booker had put forward an amendment to the bloc of bills that he said would prevent politicization and ensure resources are spread evenly among law enforcement agencies, regardless of the state they are in.",
      "\"This to me is the problem with Democrats in America right now, is we're willing to be complicit to Donald Trump, to let this pass through when we have all the leverage right now there is, to say, 'if you're as passionate about police as we are, then pass bills out of this body that will help the police officers in Washington, that will help the police officers in Illinois, that will help the police officers in New Jersey,'\" he said. \"Don't be complicit to the president of the United States.\"",
      "In response, Cortez Masto said the measures had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support \u2014 including by Booker. She criticized him for not putting forth his proposed amendment when the bills were before the panel and said his suggested change doesn't apply to her legislation.",
      "\"This is ridiculous,\" she said, adding that Booker should have raised his concerns weeks ago. \"Is this the right venue to fight for what he is seeking?\"",
      "Klobuchar, in her own remarks on the Senate floor, also defended the package and suggested Booker had missed the committee meeting when they were marked up. Booker is a member of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"I can't help it if someone couldn't change their schedule to be there,\" she said.",
      "Klobuchar said Booker has had issues with her policing bill that predate Mr. Trump's return to the White House, adding, \"One of the things I don't understand here is that we have committees for a reason, and we have hearings for a reason. And you can't do one thing on Police Week and not show up and not object and let these bills go through, and then say another a few weeks later on the floor.\"",
      "The tense back-and-forth came as Democrats have struggled to coalesce around a strategy for pushing back against Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. Republicans control both the House and Senate, leaving Democrats with limited means to derail his legislative priorities if they disagree with them.",

      "President Trump on Tuesday set a 10-day deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, or else it risks secondary sanctions, which would mean the Kremlin would have to make a deal with Ukraine by Friday, Aug. 8.",
      "The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One\u00a0as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.",
      "\"Ten days from today. Okay?\" he said on the plane.",
      "\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin \"wants peace.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

      "The American Medical Association is expressing \"deep concern\" after a\u00a0report\u00a0that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy may be planning to remove all members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.",
      "The task force, also known as the USPSTF, is a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer and diabetes screenings as well as HIV and cholesterol drugs.",
      "In a letter posted on Sunday, the AMA \u2014 the largest association of physicians in the U.S. \u2014 addressed Kennedy over a report published Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ story cited sources familiar with the matter as saying Kennedy plans to dismiss the task force members because he views them as too \"woke.\"",
      "\"USPSTF plays a critical, non-partisan role in guiding physicians' efforts to prevent disease and improve the health of patients by helping to ensure access to evidence-based clinical preventive services,\" the AMA's letter said. \"As such, we urge you to retain the previously appointed members of the USPSTF and commit to the long-standing process of regular meetings to ensure their important work can continue without interruption.\"",
      "Doctors also have expressed concerns about the potential changes.",
      "Infectious disease physician Dr. Shelley Kon shared she's \"deeply alarmed\" at the reported plans.",
      "\"The current members are volunteer experts in their field, vetted for conflicts of interest. As a physician, I rely on their expertise and recommendations when discussing preventive care with my patients in the clinic,\" Kon said in an emailed statement, adding she's especially concerned about the potential impact to safe and effective medication to prevent HIV.",
      "\"We have to insist that our guidelines are based on science, evidence-based medicine, and shared decision-making \u2014 not politics. Our nation's health depends on it,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, had similar concerns about preventative care.",
      "\"This will greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums,\" he said. \"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning \u2014 and doing the opposite of making America healthy.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, an HHS spokesperson said, \"No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "The task force was created more than 40 years ago, but its work took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the structure of the task force, but ruled that its members are \"inferior officers\" that can be \"removable at will\" by the HHS secretary. As the case played out, nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice, also known as ACIP, a separate government panel of that makes vaccine recommendations. He later named eight new advisers, including several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some members with a history as vaccine critics.",
      "Kennedy has also shared big plans to shake up medical journals in the country. The health secretary told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook he wants to create new journals and even stop the publication of NIH-funded research in traditional journals.",
      "\"We need to replicate studies, we need to publish raw data. We need to get away from the traditional journals, which are controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, and create our own journals, which we're going to do,\" Kennedy said.",

      "President Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family's luxury properties and playing golf, and agreeing on a major trade deal framework with the EU.",
      "\"Let's go. 1-2-3,\" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon.",
      "Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland.",
      "\"This has been an unbelievable development,\" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \"truly a labor of love for him.\"",
      "The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \"Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,\" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",
      "Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88.",
      "\"My mother loved Scotland,\" Mr. Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. \"It's different when your mother was born here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries\u00a0\u2014 though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",
      "Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though.",
      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",
      "Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast \u2014 some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013.",
      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",
      "Starmer said in the U.K., \"we believe in a mix\" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables.",
      "The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012.",
      "Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening.",
      "\"Even if you play badly, it's still good,\" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. \"If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also found time to to praise Turnberry's renovated ballroom, which he said he'd paid lavishly to upgrade \u2014 even suggesting that he might install one like it at the White House.",
      "\"I could take this one, drop it right down there,\" Mr. Trump joked. \"And it would be beautiful.\"",

    "summary": "Federal employees can talk about religion at work, including by encouraging coworkers to \"re-think\" their own beliefs, a memo said Monday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday told federal workers they can talk about religion at work, including by trying to \"persuade others of the correctness of their own religious views.\"",
      "In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 the government's human resources arm \u2014 said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in \"communal religious expressions\" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states.",
      "\"During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,\" it states. \"However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request.\"",
      "The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer.",
      "According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech \u2014 for example, they can \"require that employees perform official work while on duty,\" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be \"harassing in nature.\"",
      "Still, staff \"must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,\" the office said.",
      "The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can \"discuss their religious views with one another\" and \"may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views\" \u2014 but they \"must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop.\"",
      "For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers \"who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome.\"",
      "\"Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,\" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement. \"This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths.\"",
      "Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should \"adopt a generous approach\" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons.",
      "In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive \"anti-Christian weaponization of government.\" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias.",
      "The moves have drawn pushback. The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo \"outrageous and unconstitutional,\" arguing the guidance \"purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing.\"",
      "\"These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,\" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement.",

      "\"If you are in a small public school district and they don't have a full-time counselor or social worker, your only option to get mental health care is to seek help from a private provider, and there are very few of them available,\" Costa said.",

The department is being sued by 16 states, including Connecticut, over the cuts.",
      "Costa says if they lose the grant, all 19 staffers he hired may have to be let go. It's a problem many school districts across the country have shared with CBS News.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said rescissions\u2014the bills to cut funding Congress already approved\u2014are \"just a Washington name for double cross.\"",
    "story": [
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said his office is considering more options to claw back funding approved by Congress and isn't ruling out sending more bills to lawmakers with further cuts before September.",
      "Vought\u00a0said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that \"we are looking to do [a] rescissions package\" to take back some funding from the Education Department and would be \"looking at a lot of different options.\" A rescissions bill is the president's request to rescind funding already appropriated by Congress. Last week, President Trump signed a bill clawing back foreign aid, NPR and PBS funding, becoming the first president in decades to receive approval for such a measure.",
      "\"We're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again,\" Vought said of the $10 billion clawback. Asked to confirm there'd be no rescissions package before September, as Congress attempts to fund the government and head off a shutdown, Vought responded, \"Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have?\"",
      "Asked about National Institutes of Health funding for research into heart disease and cancer that has yet to be released, Vought replied, \"We're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.\" He alleged NIH had wasted funds, claiming \"$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers.\" He vowed to go \"line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly\" and said funding would be released \"when we are done with that review.\"",
      "Vought's use of rescissions measures to amend government spending is seen by Democrats and some Republicans as a backdoor method of infringing on Congress' constitutional power of the purse.",
      "\"Rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, also on \"Face the Nation,\" said after Vought's interview on the program. \"They support one thing one day \u2014 the president even signs off \u2014 and then they come back and say they change their mind.\"",
      "But the OMB director argued, \"We have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated\" under the Impoundment Control Act, which enables the president to delay spending funds appropriated by Congress, and he didn't rule out a legal battle over the executive branch's authority to revise lawmakers' spending downward, if it \"could find waste\" by an agency.",
      "Vought has also caused GOP Senate Majority Leader John Thune some headaches with a comment he made Thursday suggesting the appropriations process must be \"less bipartisan.\" But this put Thune in a bind as he oversees negotiations to avoid a government shutdown in October, since Republicans hold a slim majority of 53 - 47 in the Senate, and most legislation must reach a 60-vote threshold.",
      "\"It's going to take 60 to fund the government,\" Thune said in response to Vought's remark, and he added, \"we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation from the Democrats.\"",
      "Van Hollen said it was ironic that Vought is \"calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.\" And referring to reduction-in-force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 staff cuts the administration wants across the government, Van Hollen added, \"He asked for a 13% increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff while he's talking about RIF-ing people at other departments.\"",
      "The Maryland senator said that Democratic senators, as they negotiate funding government operations, are \"asking for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that when they say they're gonna fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.\""

    "summary": "\"It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground,\" an oceanography professor says.",
    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",

    "summary": "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when it fell 0.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace the GDP was forecast to grow for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a surprising turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with a growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is, however, still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "One measure of the economy's underlying strength tucked into the GDP report is the \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories, and net exports. That number rose at a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022. When considered alongside the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the 1.9% in the first quarter of this year, this quarter's number indicates that demand from consumers and businesses is dampening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, a North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" given the fact that it was largely driven by a 30% slump in imports after President Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "The latest data shows that in the second quarter that trend started to shift with a large drop in imports and a rise in exports \u2014 signaling that the United States is closing the trade gap President Trump has repeatedly cited as the basis for his tariff policy.",
      "Still, experts say there's more to the data than what meets the eye. If you combine the 3% growth rate in GDP in the second quarter with the 0.5% decline in first-quarter, the average growth rate for the first six months of 2025 is 1.25%.",
      "In a note shared yesterday before the GDP report, Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research, suggested that number would be  \"exceptionally weak\" when stacked up against 2024's average growth rate which was 2.8%.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "While the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy is still humming along, albeit at a slower rate.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing their spending, but not halting it completely. \"Personal spending growth will remain subdued as the labor market loses momentum and the real income shock from tariffs takes fuller form,\" he said.",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a note that while it's difficult to get a full read on the economy, it's clear that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter of 2025.",
      "Another indicator on the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is likely to hold rates steady this time around, although a cut could come in September. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release the jobs report Friday, which will give Americans a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files using a little-known law that directs executive agencies to turn over information to congressional oversight committees, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday.",
      "\"Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, and he proceeded to describe the nearly century-old law the minority would use to try to compel the release of the \"full and complete Epstein files.\"",
      "The federal law, known as Section 2954 and referred to as the \"Rule of Five,\" allows five members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs to submit an information request on matters within its jurisdiction to a federal agency. Enacted in 1928, the obscure law is part of Congress' ability to wield influence over executive branch agencies, and gives minority members of the oversight committees the ability to request information without the help of the committee chairman.",
      "The move comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent weeks, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters. The review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019, had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has divided Mr. Trump's base, with many in both parties calling for more transparency as the president has called the controversy a \"hoax.\" And Democrats have sought to capitalize on the GOP infighting.",
      "\"The situation with the Epstein files is very simple \u2014 Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,\" Schumer said. \"As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so.\"",
      "Schumer accused Republicans of choosing to \"hide\" on the Epstein files, saying, \"if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?\"",
      "The rule has rarely been used. In 2017, Democrats tried to force the release of documents relating to the leasing of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which became the site of a Trump hotel. And in 2001, Democrats under former President George W. Bush attempted to compel documents about the 2000 census. Still, with infrequent use, whether the rule could be enforced in court remains to be seen.",
      "Schumer said the request covers \"all documents, files, evidence or other materials in the possession of the Department of Justice or the FBI related to the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein.\" He noted the request includes records related to Epstein and his clients, while \"ensuring that the private information of any victims is protected.\" The minority leader said the Democrats expect the Justice Department to provide the information by Aug. 15.",

      "A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three other people. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place.",

      "What happened?",
      "Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd streets, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle.",
      "The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program.",
      "Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building.",
      "The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner.",
      "The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting for to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices of the building's owner, Rudin Management, are located. The commissioner said he \"began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,\" and struck one of the victims who eventually died.",
      "At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said.",
      "The victims",
      "A crowd gathered Tuesday evening in New York City's Bryant Park for a vigil honoring the shooting victims.",
      "The police officer killed in the lobby has been identified as 36-year-old\u00a0Didarul Islam, a four-year veteran of the NYPD based out of the 47th Precinct in the Bronx. Islam was working on a paid detail Monday as part of a program run by the police department that allows officers to provide security to private companies, CBS News New York reported.",

She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family.\"",
      "The Rudin Management employee was identified as Julia Hyman, a graduate of Cornell University who earned her degree in hotel and restaurant administration in 2020, according to the school. Michael Kotlikoff, the president of the university, said in a statement that Hyman graduated summa cum laude and had also received a minor in real estate.",

      "Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work on Sunday, when he failed to show up.",
      "Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. on Monday afternoon.",

      "\"The killer used an AR-15\u2013style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,\" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms \"only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder.\"",
      "\"The time to act is now,\" Hochul continued. \"The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen.\"",

    "summary": "The National Transportation Safety Board released new surveillance video during investigative hearings on January's deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January began Wednesday, aiming to reveal new insights into what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter. The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a\u00a0Black Hawk helicopter\u00a0while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29, killing all\u00a067 people\u00a0aboard both aircraft.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board opened the hearings in Washington, with plans to question witnesses and investigators about how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and its air traffic controllers and the Army may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001. It's likely too early for the board to identify the cause of the crash.",
      "\"This hearing is a critical part of our ongoing investigation,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said in her opening remarks. Addressing family members of some of the crash victims attending the hearing, she said, \"Please know that we are working diligently to make sure we know what occurred, how it occurred, and to prevent it from ever happening again.\"",
      "The NTSB's lead investigator began by presenting an 11-minute animation that recreated events leading up to the collision. At the end, it included newly released surveillance video with a clear view of the Black Hawk helicopter approaching the path of American Airlines flight 5342, followed by the midair impact. Before the video was played, families attending the hearing were allowed to leave the room.",
      "The plane's cockpit voice recorder showed that approximately 20 seconds before the collision, the pilots received an audible warning from the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) noting \"traffic,\" but not giving them a resolution advisory to take action. Just one to two seconds before the collision, there's a sound of a click and one of the pilots exclaims, \"Oh,\" followed by an expletive. From another document released in the investigation, it appears the pilots pulled back fully on the yoke to try to avoid the collision.",
      "Tim Lilley, whose son Sam was the plane's first officer, told CBS News he hopes the hearing will help him learn more about those final moments.",
      "\"I know that my son saw that helicopter one second before impact, and they tried very hard to avoid it,\" Lilley said. \"Sam was a good pilot, and he would have been trying to fly that aircraft all the way, all the way to the bottom.\"",
      "The collision, which sent wreckage plummeting into the Potomac River, was the first in a string of crashes and near\u00a0misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News in February that top officials at the FAA pushed last summer to close one of three runways at Reagan airport following two close calls between airliners still on the ground.",
      "Aviation attorney Bob Clifford, who is working to file one of the first lawsuits against the government next month, said he hopes NTSB will look beyond the immediate factors that caused this crash to highlight the bigger ongoing concerns in the crowded Washington airspace.",
      "\"In this particular instance, there's a much broader picture. And that is the known problems that were being ignored about an unsafe environment for the commercial aircraft to be navigating with the military aviation helicopters in the area,\" Clifford said.",
      "Legislation to require upgraded technology",
      "Even though the final NTSB report won't be released until sometime next year, Sen. Ted Cruz isn't waiting to propose changes. He introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "\"There cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,\" Cruz said. \"We should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.\"",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. It also would require the FAA to evaluate helicopter routes near airports and require the Army Inspector General to review the Army's aviation safety practices.",
      "Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",

    "summary": "A tsunami warning issued for Hawaii after one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, an 8.8 magnitude in Russia's Far East, was downgraded to an advisory after small waves peaked. A volcano in the area where the earthquake occurred was erupting Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, sending tsunami waves into Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast and Japan. Several people were injured, none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far.",
      "The 8.8 magnitude temblor struck off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, an isolated strip along the Pacific Ocean, overnight. Residents of the peninsula fled inland as 16-foot waves caused flooding.",
      "Immediately after the earthquake, Hawaii issued a tsunami warning and evacuation orders. Much of the West Coast, including California, Washington state, and the Canadian province of British Columbia, were placed under a tsunami advisory. Japan also issued an alert and evacuation orders.",
      "By Wednesday morning, many of the warnings had been downgraded: Hawaii's tsunami warning was lowered to an advisory, and evacuation orders were lifted on the Big Island and Oahu. The West Coast remained under a tsunami advisory Wednesday morning, with a section near the California-Oregon border under a warning. Japan's Meteorological Agency lowered its alerts to advisories.",
      "Experts warned that the effects of the earthquake may continue through Wednesday.",
      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",
      "\"In this case, because of the Earth basically sending out these huge ripples of water across the ocean, they're going to be moving back and forth for quite a while,\" which is why some communities may feel effects longer, he said.",
      "Hawaii sees minor flooding and small waves",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",
      "So far no damage has been recorded, but it will take two to three hours of observation before authorities will be able to determine whether the event has passed, Green said.",
      "Green said data from Midway Atoll, a small island between Japan and Hawaii, measured waves that were about 6 feet from peak to trough. He warned that waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller.",
      "Cars jammed streets and highways in Honolulu, even in areas away from the shore, as people tried to evacuate. Jimmy Markowski, who was visiting Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, said that the roads on the island were packed.",
      "\"We decided to go to elevated ground,\" Markowski told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We passed a few other gas stations, you couldn't even get in 'em.\"",
      "CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV\u00a0reported that the first waves coming ashore were relatively small, though they came at high tide. Flooding was reported in numerous shoreline areas, including parking lots and boat harbors.",
      "The PTSC said the Hilo, Hawaii, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4.9 feet relative to normal sea levels and the Kahului, Maui, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4 feet.",
      "At around 10 p.m. local time, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center director Chip McCreery said wave heights appeared to have peaked.",
      "West Coast feels some effects",
      "The Oregon Department of Emergency Management said on Facebook at around 3 a.m. local time that small tsunami waves were expected along the coast and urged people to stay away from beaches, harbors and marinas and to remain in a safe location away from the coast until the advisory is lifted.",
      "\"This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,\" the department said.",
      "A tsunami warning was posted for a 140-mile swath of the California coast, from Cape Mendocino to the California-Oregon border, according to CBS News Los Angeles. California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0saying the state's Office of Emergency Services was coordinating with local officials in Northern California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon border.",
      "Dr. Lucy Jones told CBS News Los Angeles that experts with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were predicting waves of about a foot for most of Southern California.",
      "Check out this time lapse of the Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay. Notice the abrupt up and down motion of the boats. A tsunami is not just one wave. It's a packet of waves that can last for several hours. This rapid surging of water can create dangerous currents.#tsunami pic.twitter.com/qu5joaFgLG",
      "The National Weather Service said on X that tsunami waves arrived in Monterey around 12:48 a.m. PT. Other cities along the California coast reported small to moderate-sized tsunami waves. A video shared by the National Weather Service Bay Area showed boats bobbing up and down in a harbor as they were rocked by small tsunami waves.",
      "The National Weather Service in Eureka, California,\u00a0said around 4 a.m. local time that Crescent City had seen tsunami waves of about 3.5 feet, with activity building as the region approached a minor high tide. High tide could lead to more flooding. Crescent City has seen dozens of tsunamis since the 1930s, including a 1964 event that killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.",
      "The National Weather Service Bay Area warned that even if the waves are small, they can cause \"seriously dangerous\" currents. The first waves also may not be the highest, the agency said, warning people to avoid coastal areas until told it's safe.",
      "On Alaska's Aleutian Islands, officials recorded waves up to 1.4 feet above tide levels.",
      "Kamchatka sees flooding, volcanic activity",
      "The quake was centered about 74 miles east-southeast of the Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000. Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed and experts predict aftershocks of up to 7.5 for at least a month, according to the Russian News agency TASS.",
      "The temblor appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "Earlier this month, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 89 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.",
      "The Kremlin said regional authorities on Kamchatka were well prepared for the quake. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the warnings were issued timely and people were quickly evacuated from dangerous areas. He added that the buildings proved resilient to shocks.",
      "A video released by a Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.",
      "Tsunami heights of about 9 to 13 feet were recorded in Kamchatka. Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the port in the city was flooded by tsunami waves, washing fishing boats into the sea. He said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on the Kamchatka peninsula lifted the tsunami warning for the area, some 11 hours after the quake hit. Russian authorities said several people were injured, without giving a figure. The risk of aftershocks and waves remains, officials said.",
      "On Wednesday, lava began to flow from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The 15,584-foot volcano, located in the east of Kamchatka, last erupted in 2023. Observers heard explosions and saw streams of lava on the volcano's western slopes, the Kamchatka branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said.",
      "Scientists have anticipated an eruption, with the volcano's crater filling with lava for several weeks and the mountain spitting out plumes of ash.",
      "\"The Klyuchevskoy is erupting right now,\" the Russian Geophysical Survey said on Telegram, posting photos of an orange blaze on top of the volcano and adding that \"red-hot lava is observed flowing down the western slope. There is a powerful glow above the volcano and explosions.\"",
      "Sometimes described as the \"land of fire and ice,\" Kamchatka is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. It has about 300 volcanoes, of which 29 are active, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "Earthquake sparks international response",
      "The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japanese and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its strength to 8.8 magnitude and a depth of 13 miles.",
      "People went to evacuation centers in affected areas of Japan, with memories fresh of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The tsunami alert disrupted transportation, with ferries, trains and airports in the affected area suspending or delaying some operations.",
      "Waves of about 2 feet were recorded on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and at least one person was injured.",
      "Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nearly 2 million residents are now under evacuation advisories in more than 220 municipalities along the Pacific coast as of midday Wednesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and he urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat. He told evacuees they might not be able to return home by the end of the day on Wednesday.",
      "No abnormalities in operations at Japan's nuclear plants were reported on Wednesday. The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, heavily damaged by the 2011 tsunami, said about 4,000 workers are taking shelter on higher ground at the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure safety.",
      "China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for parts of the country's east coast along Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces. The warning forecasted that waves could reach between one to three feet. The provinces are already under an alert as Typhoon CoMay is expected to land in the Zhejiang province on Wednesday.",
      "Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world's most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas due to\u00a0climate change. People were urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed late Wednesday in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Philippine authorities advised people to stay away from the beach and coastal areas.",
      "\"It may not be the largest of waves, but these can continue for hours and expose people swimming in the waters to danger,\" Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told The Associated Press.",
      "Elsewhere, a tsunami of under a foot was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Mexico's navy warned that tsunami waves will start reaching the northern coast in Ensenada, near California, at around 02:22 a.m. Wednesday local time, and waves could progress along the Pacific coast to Chiapas state, around 07:15 a.m. local time.",
      "In Chile, tsunami warnings were upgraded to their highest level on Wednesday morning. The alert covers most of the nation's 4,000-mile Pacific coastline. The country's Education Ministry also canceled classes along much of the coast.",
      "New Zealand authorities warned of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along all coastlines of the South Pacific island nation. The emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.",
      "How are tsunami probabilities categorized?",
      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service.",
      "A tsunami warning is the most severe. It means residents should take action due to a coming tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory means there's the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS.",
      "A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises people to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-powell-trump-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-july-30/",
    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:02:22 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at today's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about three-quarters of middle-income consumers saying they're cutting back on non-essential purchases, according to a recent\u00a0survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "About one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage in the past year, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

      "Update: The tsunami warning for Hawaii and Japan was lowered to an advisory overnight. Read the latest here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting Japan's meteorological agency to issue a tsunami alert and the National Weather Service to issue a tsunami warning for Hawaii and parts of Alaska on Wednesday.",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami wave in Hawaii was 7:17 p.m. local time (1:17 a.m. EDT).",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said data from Midway Atoll, between Japan and Hawaii, measured tsunami waves from peak to trough of 6 feet. He said waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller and it was too early to tell how large they would be. A tsunami of that size would be akin to a three foot Wave riding on top of surf, he said.",
      "He told a new conference that a wave that size could move cars and throw fences around. \"It can dislodge trees, that's why you can't just be out there. The impact is at great speed,\" Green said. \"Any any structure that gets loose and strikes the individual could take them out. And people can drown quite easily with the force of that kind of wave.\"",
      "A tsunami advisory was also issued for parts of Alaska and the entire West Coast, from the California-Mexico border up to the Alaska-British Columbia border.",
      "Japan's meteorological agency said the quake occurred at 8:25 a.m. local time on Wednesday and registered a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, later adjusted by the U.S. Geological Survey to 8.8 and the USGS said the earthquake occurred at a depth of 13 miles.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency said a first tsunami wave of about 30 centimeters, or approximately 1 foot, reached Nemuro on the eastern coast of Hokkaido.",
      "The first tsunami wave hit the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk, the main settlement on Russia's Kuril Islands in the Pacific, according to the local governor Valery Limarenko. He said residents were safe and staying on high ground until the threat of a repeat wave was gone.",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said waves of 1 to 3 meters, or about 3 to 10 feet, above tide level were possible along some coastal areas of Hawaii, Chile, Japan and the Solomon Islands. Waves of more than 3 meters were possible along some coastal areas of Russia and Ecuador.",
      "Tsunami warning sirens blared Tuesday in Honolulu and people moved to higher ground.",
      "\"If you're in a safe place, stay there, and if you're not, do something about it. Get to higher ground,\" Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference Tuesday night.",
      "\"A tsunami has been generated that could cause damage along coastlines of all islands in the state of Hawaii. Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property,\" the National Weather Service said in an alert. The arrival of the first wave was predicted at around 7:17 p.m. local time, or about 1:17 a.m. ET.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed an emergency proclamation in response to the potential flooding and damage.",
      "\"The danger can continue for many hours after an initial wave as subsequent waves arrive,\" NWS said. \"Tsunami heights cannot be predicted and the first wave may not be the largest. Tsunami waves efficiently wrap around islands. All shores are at risk no matter which direction they face.\"",
      "In response to the tsunami warnings, President Trump wrote in a social media post Tuesday night to \"STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"",
      "The quake was about 160 miles away from Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost of the country's four big islands, and was felt only slightly, according to Japan's NHK television.",
      "Russia's TASS news agency reported from the biggest city near the epicenter, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, that many people ran out into the street without shoes or outerwear. Cabinets toppled inside homes, mirrors were broken, cars swayed in the street and balconies on buildings shook noticeably.",
      "TASS reported power outages and mobile phone service failures in the capital of the Kamchatka region. The news agency also quoted a local Russian official as saying residents on Sakhalin Island were being evacuated and emergency services were working at full capacity.",
      "The earthquake appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the March 2011 earthquake off northeast Japan that measured 9.0 magnitude and caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a Fukushima nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "New Zealand authorities issued warnings of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along coastlines throughout the country. The alert by the government emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas, and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries. New Zealand is in the South Pacific and about 6,000 miles from the epicenter.",
      "Over a week ago, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. And earlier this month, a tsunami advisory for\u00a0Alaska's southern peninsula was issued after a major earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.3 hit the Aleutian Islands area.",
      "On Nov. 4, 1952, a magnitude 9.0 quake in Kamchatka caused damage but no reported deaths despite setting off 9.1-meter (30-foot) waves in Hawaii.",
      "How are tsunami levels categorized?",
      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the National Weather Service. A tsunami warning is the most severe alert, meaning residents should take action due to a tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory has the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS. A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises those to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

    "summary": "Sen. Cory Booker's tense exchange with two fellow Democrats marked a rare moment of intraparty disagreement that played out on the Senate floor.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey sparred with fellow Democrats on Tuesday over a bipartisan policing package, accusing them of being \"complicit\" in President Trump's agenda in a rare moment of intraparty disagreement that played out on the Senate floor.",
      "The heated exchange arose after Booker objected to a motion from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, to swiftly pass a package of bills related to law enforcement. Booker said he wanted to make a change to the bloc of measures to ensure resources are distributed equally among law enforcement agencies in response to the Justice Department's changes to grant programs and cancellation of awards.",
      "\"We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we're willing to go along with that today,\" he said. \"No, no. Not on my watch. I stand against this. It is a violation of our Constitution for the president of the United States to ignore the will of Congress and decide which states are eligible for grants and which are not.\"",
      "Booker accused Cortez Masto and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who backs the legislative package, of lecturing him.",
      "\"What I am tired of is when the president of the United States violates the Constitution, trashes our norms and traditions and what does the Democratic Party do? Comply? Allow him? Beg for scraps? No. I demand justice,\" he said.",
      "Booker said the Democratic Party \"needs a wake-up call.\"",
      "\"It's time for Democrats to have a backbone. It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw lines,\" he said, as his voice started rising. \"Don't question my integrity. Don't question my motives.\"",
      "Booker said in his remarks from the Senate floor that the Justice Department has been weaponizing public safety grants to punish state and local jurisdictions that oppose Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, and it is withholding funds from law enforcement agencies across the country when they were approved by Congress with bipartisan backing.",
      "\"It is disgraceful, it is unfair, it is unjust and it is dangerously reckless toward the officers whose well-being they are jeopardizing,\" Booker said. \"Federal funds should not be used for partisan political gains.\"",
      "The New Jersey Democrat lambasted his colleagues and accused them of effectively blessing Mr. Trump's decision to rescind grant funds by approving the legislative package.",
      "\"For us as a body to move forward right now is being complicit in what Donald Trump is doing,\" Booker said. \"I say no. I say we stand. I say we fight. I say we reject this, and that in a bipartisan way, we demand an end to this kind of constitutionally unjust carving up of the resources we approve.\"",
      "Booker had put forward an amendment to the bloc of bills that he said would prevent politicization and ensure resources are spread evenly among law enforcement agencies, regardless of the state they are in.",
      "\"This to me is the problem with Democrats in America right now, is we're willing to be complicit to Donald Trump, to let this pass through when we have all the leverage right now there is, to say, 'if you're as passionate about police as we are, then pass bills out of this body that will help the police officers in Washington, that will help the police officers in Illinois, that will help the police officers in New Jersey,'\" he said. \"Don't be complicit to the president of the United States.\"",
      "In response, Cortez Masto said the measures had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support \u2014 including by Booker. She criticized him for not putting forth his proposed amendment when the bills were before the panel and said his suggested change doesn't apply to her legislation.",
      "\"This is ridiculous,\" she said, adding that Booker should have raised his concerns weeks ago. \"Is this the right venue to fight for what he is seeking?\"",
      "Klobuchar, in her own remarks on the Senate floor, also defended the package and suggested Booker had missed the committee meeting when they were marked up. Booker is a member of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"I can't help it if someone couldn't change their schedule to be there,\" she said.",
      "Klobuchar said Booker has had issues with her policing bill that predate Mr. Trump's return to the White House, adding, \"One of the things I don't understand here is that we have committees for a reason, and we have hearings for a reason. And you can't do one thing on Police Week and not show up and not object and let these bills go through, and then say another a few weeks later on the floor.\"",
      "The tense back-and-forth came as Democrats have struggled to coalesce around a strategy for pushing back against Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. Republicans control both the House and Senate, leaving Democrats with limited means to derail his legislative priorities if they disagree with them.",

      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas.

    "summary": "A tsunami warning issued for Hawaii after one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, an 8.8 magnitude in Russia's Far East, was downgraded to an advisory after small waves peaked. A volcano in the area where the earthquake occurred was erupting Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, sending tsunami waves into Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast and Japan. Several people were injured, none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far.",
      "The 8.8 magnitude temblor struck off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, an isolated strip along the Pacific Ocean, overnight. Residents of the peninsula fled inland as 16-foot waves caused flooding.",
      "Immediately after the earthquake, Hawaii issued a tsunami warning and evacuation orders. Much of the West Coast, including California, Washington state, and the Canadian province of British Columbia, were placed under a tsunami advisory. Japan also issued an alert and evacuation orders.",
      "By Wednesday morning, many of the warnings had been downgraded: Hawaii's tsunami warning was lowered to an advisory, and evacuation orders were lifted on the Big Island and Oahu. The West Coast remained under a tsunami advisory Wednesday morning, with a section near the California-Oregon border under a warning. Japan's Meteorological Agency lowered its alerts to advisories.",
      "Experts warned that the effects of the earthquake may continue through Wednesday.",
      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",
      "\"In this case, because of the Earth basically sending out these huge ripples of water across the ocean, they're going to be moving back and forth for quite a while,\" which is why some communities may feel effects longer, he said.",
      "Hawaii sees minor flooding and small waves",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",
      "So far no damage has been recorded, but it will take two to three hours of observation before authorities will be able to determine whether the event has passed, Green said.",
      "Green said data from Midway Atoll, a small island between Japan and Hawaii, measured waves that were about 6 feet from peak to trough. He warned that waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller.",
      "Cars jammed streets and highways in Honolulu, even in areas away from the shore, as people tried to evacuate. Jimmy Markowski, who was visiting Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, said that the roads on the island were packed.",
      "\"We decided to go to elevated ground,\" Markowski told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We passed a few other gas stations, you couldn't even get in 'em.\"",
      "CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV\u00a0reported that the first waves coming ashore were relatively small, though they came at high tide. Flooding was reported in numerous shoreline areas, including parking lots and boat harbors.",
      "The PTSC said the Hilo, Hawaii, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4.9 feet relative to normal sea levels and the Kahului, Maui, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4 feet.",
      "At around 10 p.m. local time, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center director Chip McCreery said wave heights appeared to have peaked.",
      "West Coast feels some effects",
      "The Oregon Department of Emergency Management said on Facebook at around 3 a.m. local time that small tsunami waves were expected along the coast and urged people to stay away from beaches, harbors and marinas and to remain in a safe location away from the coast until the advisory is lifted.",
      "\"This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,\" the department said.",
      "A tsunami warning was posted for a 140-mile swath of the California coast, from Cape Mendocino to the California-Oregon border, according to CBS News Los Angeles. California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0saying the state's Office of Emergency Services was coordinating with local officials in Northern California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon border.",
      "Dr. Lucy Jones told CBS News Los Angeles that experts with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were predicting waves of about a foot for most of Southern California.",
      "Check out this time lapse of the Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay. Notice the abrupt up and down motion of the boats. A tsunami is not just one wave. It's a packet of waves that can last for several hours. This rapid surging of water can create dangerous currents.#tsunami pic.twitter.com/qu5joaFgLG",
      "The National Weather Service said on X that tsunami waves arrived in Monterey around 12:48 a.m. PT. Other cities along the California coast reported small to moderate-sized tsunami waves. A video shared by the National Weather Service Bay Area showed boats bobbing up and down in a harbor as they were rocked by small tsunami waves.",
      "The National Weather Service in Eureka, California,\u00a0said around 4 a.m. local time that Crescent City had seen tsunami waves of about 3.5 feet, with activity building as the region approached a minor high tide. High tide could lead to more flooding. Crescent City has seen dozens of tsunamis since the 1930s, including a 1964 event that killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.",
      "The National Weather Service Bay Area warned that even if the waves are small, they can cause \"seriously dangerous\" currents. The first waves also may not be the highest, the agency said, warning people to avoid coastal areas until told it's safe.",
      "On Alaska's Aleutian Islands, officials recorded waves up to 1.4 feet above tide levels.",
      "Kamchatka sees flooding, volcanic activity",
      "The quake was centered about 74 miles east-southeast of the Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000. Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed and experts predict aftershocks of up to 7.5 for at least a month, according to the Russian News agency TASS.",
      "The temblor appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "Earlier this month, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 89 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.",
      "The Kremlin said regional authorities on Kamchatka were well prepared for the quake. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the warnings were issued timely and people were quickly evacuated from dangerous areas. He added that the buildings proved resilient to shocks.",
      "A video released by a Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.",
      "Tsunami heights of about 9 to 13 feet were recorded in Kamchatka. Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the port in the city was flooded by tsunami waves, washing fishing boats into the sea. He said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on the Kamchatka peninsula lifted the tsunami warning for the area, some 11 hours after the quake hit. Russian authorities said several people were injured, without giving a figure. The risk of aftershocks and waves remains, officials said.",
      "On Wednesday, lava began to flow from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The 15,584-foot volcano, located in the east of Kamchatka, last erupted in 2023. Observers heard explosions and saw streams of lava on the volcano's western slopes, the Kamchatka branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said.",
      "Scientists have anticipated an eruption, with the volcano's crater filling with lava for several weeks and the mountain spitting out plumes of ash.",
      "\"The Klyuchevskoy is erupting right now,\" the Russian Geophysical Survey said on Telegram, posting photos of an orange blaze on top of the volcano and adding that \"red-hot lava is observed flowing down the western slope. There is a powerful glow above the volcano and explosions.\"",
      "Sometimes described as the \"land of fire and ice,\" Kamchatka is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. It has about 300 volcanoes, of which 29 are active, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "Earthquake sparks international response",
      "The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japanese and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its strength to 8.8 magnitude and a depth of 13 miles.",
      "People went to evacuation centers in affected areas of Japan, with memories fresh of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The tsunami alert disrupted transportation, with ferries, trains and airports in the affected area suspending or delaying some operations.",
      "Waves of about 2 feet were recorded on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and at least one person was injured.",
      "Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nearly 2 million residents are now under evacuation advisories in more than 220 municipalities along the Pacific coast as of midday Wednesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and he urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat. He told evacuees they might not be able to return home by the end of the day on Wednesday.",
      "No abnormalities in operations at Japan's nuclear plants were reported on Wednesday. The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, heavily damaged by the 2011 tsunami, said about 4,000 workers are taking shelter on higher ground at the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure safety.",
      "China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for parts of the country's east coast along Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces. The warning forecasted that waves could reach between one to three feet. The provinces are already under an alert as Typhoon CoMay is expected to land in the Zhejiang province on Wednesday.",
      "Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world's most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas due to\u00a0climate change. People were urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed late Wednesday in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Philippine authorities advised people to stay away from the beach and coastal areas.",
      "\"It may not be the largest of waves, but these can continue for hours and expose people swimming in the waters to danger,\" Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told The Associated Press.",
      "Elsewhere, a tsunami of under a foot was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Mexico's navy warned that tsunami waves will start reaching the northern coast in Ensenada, near California, at around 02:22 a.m. Wednesday local time, and waves could progress along the Pacific coast to Chiapas state, around 07:15 a.m. local time.",
      "In Chile, tsunami warnings were upgraded to their highest level on Wednesday morning. The alert covers most of the nation's 4,000-mile Pacific coastline. The country's Education Ministry also canceled classes along much of the coast.",
      "New Zealand authorities warned of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along all coastlines of the South Pacific island nation. The emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.",
      "How are tsunami probabilities categorized?",
      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service.",
      "A tsunami warning is the most severe. It means residents should take action due to a coming tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory means there's the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS.",
      "A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises people to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

      "One of the three men suspected of an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue last year was arrested, police said Wednesday.",
      "A 21-year-old Melbourne man, who was not identified, was arrested at a house on suspicion he had set the fire at the Adass Israel Synagogue in December, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Wendy Steendam said.",
      "The predawn attack on Dec. 6, 2024, destroyed the synagogue and left a worshipper with minor burns.",
      "The arrest is a major breakthrough for investigators in the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team that is treating the attack as\u00a0politically motivated.",
      "The team involves Victoria state and federal police, as well as Australia's main domestic spy agency. More than 220 law enforcement officers have devoted more than 50,000 hours to the investigation.",
      "\"Today's arrest is a demonstration of our ongoing efforts to hold those involved to account,\" Steendam said in a statement announcing the arrest. \"We now have charged two people as part of this investigation and I expect there will be more to come.\"",
      "Two weeks ago, a 20-year-old man was charged with stealing the car used in the synagogue attack. But that suspect has not been accused of being one of the masked men who used brooms to spread a liquid accelerant across the floor of the synagogue before igniting it.",
      "An arson conviction carries a potential maximum of 15 years in prison, while the other two offenses are each punishable by 10 years imprisonment. The suspect has yet to be charged.",
      "\"I want to reassure Victorians, particularly those in the Jewish community, that we remain relentless in our pursuit in finding all those responsible for this crime and holding them to account,\" Steendam told reporters.",

      "Barrett declined to say who the offshore suspects were or identify the countries they were operating in.",
      "\"This crime was despicable as it was dangerous, and it is important to acknowledge that this was not just an arson on a synagogue,\" she added in a statement. \"The effect of this crime has rippled through a community that continues to be targeted by criminals. We will not stand for this.\"",
      "A wave of antisemitic attacks has roiled Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas assault on Israel triggered the war in Gaza.

And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",

      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

The arrival of the first wave was predicted at around 7:17 p.m. local time, or about 1:17 a.m. ET.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:40:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The leading international authority on food crises predicted \"widespread death\" in Gaza without immediate action.",
    "story": [
      "The \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,\" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday, predicting \"widespread death\" without immediate action.",
      "The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war.",
      "The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have \"dramatically worsened\" the situation, including \"increasingly stringent blockades\" by Israel.",
      "\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,\" the IPC said. \"Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\"",
      "A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.",
      "\"Deadly turning point\" reached",
      "But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,\" Alex de Waal, author of \"Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press.",
      "An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:",
      "At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.",
      "The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached \"an alarming and deadly turning point.\" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza \u2014 at its lowest level since the war began \u2014 and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished.",
      "Mounting evidence shows \"widespread starvation,\" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed. One in three people in Gaza is going without food for days at a time, according to the World Food Program. Hospitals report a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths in children under 5. Gaza's population of over 2 million has been squeezed into increasingly tiny areas of the devastated territory.",
      "The IPC's latest analysis in May warned that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn't lift its blockade and stop its military campaign. Its new alert calls for immediate and large-scale action and warns: \"Failure to act now will result in widespread death in much of the strip.\"",
      "Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.",
      "Israel eased those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that has been wracked by chaos and violence. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds swarm entering convoys.",
      "While Israel says there's no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza, U.N. agencies and aid groups say even the latest humanitarian measures are not enough to counter the worsening starvation. In a statement Monday, Doctors Without Borders called the new airdrops ineffective and dangerous, saying they deliver less aid than trucks.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said no one is starving in Gaza and that Israel has supplied enough aid throughout the war, \"otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\" Israel's military on Monday criticized what it calls \"false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza.\"",
      "Israel's closest ally now appears to disagree. \"Those children look very hungry,\" President Trump said Monday of the images from Gaza in recent days.",

    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom will recognize Palestine as a state in September unless Israel takes \"substantive steps\" to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday.",
      "Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps \u2014 including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution.",
      "\"Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,\" Starmer added.",
      "Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the \"two-state solution is in peril.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear \u2014 the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,\" Lammy said.",
      "In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that \"Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims.\"",
      "\"A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a \"reward for Hamas\" that \"harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.",
      "He added: \"I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday.",
      "\"He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,\" the spokeswoman said.",
      "The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September.",
      "\"Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,\" Macron said at the time. \"The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel \"strongly\" condemned that decision and said that it \"rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.\"",
      "\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" the Israeli leader said in a post on X.",
      "That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops.",
      "France's top diplomat, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "\"Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,\" Barrot said.",
      "The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September.",

It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",

      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",

      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

The museum's door was pried open at 1:26 a.m. The thieves left the building at 1:35 a.m., officials said, leaving them just a few minutes to smash open a display case and take the treasure. No alarms were triggered during the incident. The museum did not have an overnight guard.",

The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor.",

      "President Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family's luxury properties and playing golf, and agreeing on a major trade deal framework with the EU.",
      "\"Let's go. 1-2-3,\" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon.",
      "Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland.",
      "\"This has been an unbelievable development,\" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \"truly a labor of love for him.\"",
      "The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \"Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,\" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",

      "Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries\u00a0\u2014 though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",
      "Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though.",
      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",
      "Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast \u2014 some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013.",
      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",
      "Starmer said in the U.K., \"we believe in a mix\" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables.",
      "The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012.",
      "Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening.",
      "\"Even if you play badly, it's still good,\" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. \"If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also found time to to praise Turnberry's renovated ballroom, which he said he'd paid lavishly to upgrade \u2014 even suggesting that he might install one like it at the White House.",
      "\"I could take this one, drop it right down there,\" Mr. Trump joked. \"And it would be beautiful.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products \"may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.\"",
      "\"I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid.

      "Testing, treatment and prevention",
      "A blood test can help diagnose Lyme disease, but timing matters.",

      "The NRSC submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in April 2025, attempting to release the files relating to her suspected cocaine use trial amid suspicion that Democrats were recruiting her to jump into the state's Senate race.",
      "While NARA initially told the NRSC they would review the request, they later claimed 3,000 pages of the files were under FOIA exemption, which preserves the secrecy of grand jury testimony.",
      "The NRSC is now appealing the denial of those records, citing public interest in the case. Fox News Digital first reported last month on the newly unearthed memo that contradicts Mills' claim that an investigation into her alleged cocaine use was politically motivated.",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the FBI to conduct an immediate counter intelligence threat assessment on the Jeffrey Epstein files, claiming potential national security risks.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called on the FBI to conduct a counterintelligence threat assessment on the Jeffrey Epstein files.",
      "Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday that the FBI assessment should accomplish three things: determine if foreign intelligence agencies could gain access to the information \"the president does not want to release in the Epstein files, through methods that include cyber intrusion;\" identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by foreign intelligence agencies with access to non-public information in the Epstein files, \"including being able to gain leverage over Donald Trump, his family, or other senior government officials;\" and result in the FBI publicly showing that the bureau is \"developing mitigation strategies to counter these threats and safeguard our national security.\"",
      "At his weekly Democratic leadership press conference afterward, Schumer condemned what he categorized as the Epstein \"cover-up,\" further taking aim at President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",
      "\"Trump promised he'd release the Epstein files while he was on the campaign trail, yet he has yet to do it,\" Schumer told reporters. \"Speaker Johnson quite literally preferred to shut down Congress, sending everyone home on an Epstein recess to avoid the topic. Americans are right to be angry over the lack of transparency, but there are also some very real questions about risks to national security.\"",

      "\"Given Trump's total about-face on releasing files and given what we know from the FBI whistleblowers, it's natural to ask, what happens if our adversaries use cyberattacks and other means to access files and materials into Epstein that are damaging or worse for President Trump and or those around him?\" Schumer continued. \"What happens if the Epstein files end up in the hands of Russia or North Korea, or Chinese governments? Unless the Epstein files are fully released to the public, could our adversaries use that, Epstein, to use that information to blackmail someone like the president?",
      "Last Thursday, Schumer noted, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services were among several government agencies hacked as part of a breach to Microsoft SharePoint system.",
      "\"This was confirmed that it was Chinese actors. So we don't need this happening again,\" Schumer said. \"We have to ensure that it can't happen. National security is not and should never be a partisan issue. We need to do everything we can to make sure we protecting the U.S. and American families. This report is vital in doing that. Beyond that, there is one more thing Donald Trump could do to quell people's anger, confusion, frustration, and/or deep fears. That is, release the files.\"",
      "Last week, Johnson ended the House legislative session a day early, averting a potential vote on a resolution by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., that would have compelled the Justice Department and the FBI to release the Epstein files. Johnson asserted on Sunday that House Republicans supported \"maximum disclosure\" but argued that the resolution was \"reckless\" and poorly drafted, arguing that it ignored federal rules protecting grand jury materials and \"would require the DOJ and FBI to release information that they know is false, that is based on lies and rumors and was not even credible enough to be entered into the court proceedings.\"",

      "\"That's such old history. Very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it. But for years, I wouldn't talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I wouldn't talk because he did something that was inappropriate,\" Trump told reporters. \"He hired help, and I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He stole people that worked for me. I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He did it again, and I threw him out of the place, persona non grata. I threw him out and that was it.\"",

      "The Justice Department on Monday accused U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of misconduct, escalating the Trump administration\u2019s long-running feud against federal judges who have blocked or paused some of the president's most sweeping policy priorities.",
      "The complaint, reviewed by Fox News Digital, centers on remarks Boasberg allegedly made during a March 11 meeting of the Judicial Conference of the United States \u2014 the national policymaking body for the federal courts, which meets twice per year and is headed up by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "During that meeting, the complaint says, Boasberg \"attempted to improperly influence Chief Justice Roberts\" and the roughly two dozen other federal judges at the conference by suggesting that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts,\" and trigger \"a constitutional crisis.\"",

      "Fox News Digital could not independently verify Boasberg\u2019s reported remarks at the March 11 meeting, and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials have argued the reported remarks were an attempt to improperly prejudice or influence Roberts and said they \"undermined the integrity and impartiality of the federal judiciary.\"",
      "The complaint asked, not for the first time, that Boasberg be removed from presiding over J.G.G. v. Trump, a lawsuit filed in March by lawyers for the ACLU and others on behalf of the hundreds of immigrants who were summarily deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison under the auspices of a wartime immigration law.",

      "Boasberg, in particular, has emerged as one of Trump's biggest public foes. On March 15, several days after he allegedly made the remarks included in the DOJ complaint, Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order seeking to block Trump\u2019s use of a 1798 wartime-era immigration law, the Alien Enemies Act, to summarily deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador.",

      "Boasberg ordered all planes bound for El Salvador to be \"immediately\" returned to U.S. soil, which did not happen, and later, ordered a new investigation to determine whether the Trump administration had complied with his orders. In April, he ruled that the court had grounds to move on possible contempt proceedings, though that ruling was stayed by a higher appeals court, which has yet to consider the matter.",
      "His March 15 order touched off a complex legal saga that ultimately spawned dozens of deportation-related court challenges across the country \u2014 though the one brought before Boasberg was the very first \u2014 and later prompted the Supreme Court to rule, on two separate occasions, that the hurried removals had violated migrants' due process protections under the U.S. Constitution.",

      "Their attacks have centered closely on the behavior of several judges \u2014 but no one more so than Boasberg, an Obama appointee who was originally tapped by then-President George W. Bush in 2002 to be an associate judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court.",

      "For some, the complaint seems to be well-timed: Boasberg ordered the Justice Department and the ACLU to court for a status hearing last week to determine the status of the 252 CECOT plaintiffs who were deported to Venezuela from El Salvador as part of a prisoner exchange with Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro.",

      "\"So the fact that this facility is no longer even going to be an option, even if surgical abortion was reinstated here in the state of Texas, that facility is no longer going to be operational,\" she continued. \"It's no longer going to be able to be used as an abortion facility.

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "The alerts use machine learning models that constantly update and improve. These AI tools analyze billions of data points to detect new scam patterns, even ones they haven't seen before. If a payment seems suspicious, the system will interrupt the transaction with a tailored alert. And the higher the risk, the stronger the warning.",

The acquisition, which could support tech companies with energy access for new data centers, received initial support from state agencies after negotiation.

      "Keep a few limitations of ChatGPT agent in mind",
      "Although ChatGPT agent breaks new ground, it does not always deliver instant results. When handling complex multi-step tasks like planning an entire itinerary or generating slide decks, the process can take minutes or even hours because it requires your confirmation before performing sensitive actions.",
      "Currently, slide deck creation remains in beta. While the outputs are organized and editable, they sometimes lack polish and may show formatting issues. The system does not yet support importing existing slideshow templates, but OpenAI plans to add this feature in future updates.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Now, imagine delegating your most tedious tasks, such as replying to emails, booking dinners, or researching vacations, to an assistant who truly acts on your behalf. ChatGPT agent equips ChatGPT with both intelligence and action; it goes beyond suggesting ideas by actually getting things done.",
      "You retain full control while avoiding the need to micromanage every click or keystroke. Whether your schedule fills quickly or you simply dislike digital grunt work, ChatGPT agent is built to manage these demands efficiently.",
      "Looking ahead, OpenAI intends for the agent to work even more independently, completing your to-do list as you focus on what matters most. The key question remains: how much will you be willing to hand off?",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "In Greek mythology, the Sirens were creatures whose irresistible song lured sailors to their doom. Odysseus, the hero of\u00a0\"The Odyssey,\" wanted to hear that famous song. But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why? Because Odysseus understood that once he heard their song, he wouldn't be able to resist. And that song always leads to trouble.",

      "A dad working on his laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles.

      "An aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows.",
      "Delta Air Lines, one of the country's largest carriers, is making headlines for its ambitious rollout of artificial intelligence-powered ticket pricing. Instead of fixed fares, Delta is using AI.",
      "The airline emphasizes that the system doesn't use personal data like your habits or booking history. Rather, it relies on aggregated market trends and analyst oversight to determine fares.",
      "By the end of this year, Delta aims to set 20% of ticket prices dynamically using AI, a sevenfold increase from just a year ago. This high-tech approach could result in better deals or higher costs, not because of who you are, but because of market demand at the time you book. Let's take a look at how it works, why Delta's betting on it and what it means for your wallet.",

      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: WARNING ON ELECTRICITY PRICES",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants smarter, not personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues.",
      "However, the airline states it is not personalizing prices based on individual behavior. Instead, the AI analyzes large-scale patterns, like route demand, seasonal shifts, and timing trends, before analysts set final prices.",
      "Delta's strategy is simple \u2014 a price that's available on that flight, at that time, to you, the individual.",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'",
      "If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.",
      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.",

      "PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.",

      "AI and data centers are fueling a surge in energy use",
      "AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.",
      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",

      "How AI is increasing your electric bill",
      "Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.",
      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",

It uses 32 integrated sensors, including LiDAR, radar, visible-light and surround-view cameras and ultrasonic sensors. This setup delivers precise environmental awareness for everything from highway cruising to close-range maneuvers.",

      "These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.",
      "Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.",
      "The rearview of Lucid Air with hands-free software. (Lucid Motors)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as the Lucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.",

Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private.

      "A stethoscope and an electrocardiogram image\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is structural heart disease, and why is it so dangerous?",
      "SHD refers to defects in the heart's walls, valves or chambers. Some are present at birth. Others develop slowly over time. Either way, they often go unnoticed until something major happens, like a heart attack or stroke. That's why experts sometimes call SHD the \"hidden\" heart disease. Here's the problem. Even the ECGs doctors routinely use to spot heart issues often can't detect SHD on their own. And that's where EchoNext comes in.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "EchoNext: The AI that knows when to dig deeper",
      "EchoNext was created by researchers at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian. The tool was trained on over 1.2 million ECG and echocardiogram pairs from more than 230,000 patients. Its job? Figure out when a patient's ECG suggests a deeper look is needed, specifically, an echocardiogram, the ultrasound that gives a detailed view of heart structure.",

      "EchoNext outperformed human cardiologists",
      "In tests, EchoNext correctly flagged 77% of structural heart disease cases from ECGs. Cardiologists? Just 64%. Even more impressive, when tested on nearly 85,000 people, EchoNext identified over 7,500 at high risk for undiagnosed SHD. A year later, researchers found that 73% of those who followed up with echocardiograms were indeed diagnosed with SHD, a rate far above average. These groundbreaking results were published in Nature, one of the world's most respected scientific journals. That's not just a better test. That's a potential lifesaver.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why this matters now more than ever",
      "Millions walk around every day with SHD and have no idea. They skip heart screenings because nothing feels wrong. Even when they do get an ECG, subtle warning signs can slip by unnoticed. EchoNext doesn't miss them. And it doesn't get tired or distracted. This isn't about replacing doctors. Iit's about giving them a powerful new tool to catch what humans alone can't.",

      "You don't need to wait for symptoms to take your heart health seriously. If you've ever had an ECG, or you're getting one soon, AI could now help spot hidden risks your doctor might miss. Tools like EchoNext make it easier to catch heart problems early, even if you feel fine.",
      "This means fewer surprises, fewer missed diagnoses and a better shot at treatment before it's too late. It's not about replacing doctors. It's about giving them, and you, a better shot at catching problems early. Ask your doctor if AI tools are being used to review your heart tests. You deserve every advantage.

      "An overnight filing by the Department of Justice revealed the grand juries in both Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s cases had heard from two law enforcement witnesses, as officials are asking for the release of transcripts stemming from both sex trafficking indictments.",
      "In a Tuesday filing in Manhattan federal court, officials disclosed the Epstein grand jury heard testimony from an FBI agent when it met in June and July 2019. The same FBI agent, along with a New York Police Department detective, also testified in front of the Maxwell grand jury in June and July 2020, and again in March 2021, according to court documents.",
      "\"Here, there was one witness\u2014an FBI agent\u2014during the Epstein grand jury proceedings,\" the filing said. \"There were two witnesses\u2014the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a detective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI\u2019s Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force\u2014during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\"",

      "The filing was submitted after federal judges presiding over both cases asked the DOJ to provide additional details surrounding the cases. The DOJ previously requested to unseal grand jury transcripts of proceedings, resulting in the judges asking for additional information.",
      "Courts rarely release grand jury transcripts, unless officials find they are imperative to a judicial proceeding.",
      "However, the filing cites a 1997 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that determined judges can exercise discretion when deciding to unseal transcripts, and public interest can justify their release.",
      "According to the filing, the factors determining the release of transcripts \"are designed to assist the Court in exercising its \u2018careful judgment\u2019 in balancing the interests in public disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest and the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.\"",

      "\"There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s crimes,\" the filing said. \"Beyond that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes.\"",
      "The request to unseal the transcripts came after the DOJ previously announced it would not be releasing any additional files relating to Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking case, with the filing asserting it is \"consistent with increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.\"",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing evidently aimed to tamp down expectations surrounding any new revelations within the transcripts by asserting \"certain aspects and subject matters\" were previously made public during Maxwell\u2019s trial.",

Lee Zeldin, now the Trump administration Secretary of the Environmental Protection Agency, to get the FBI files released.

      "Hoffa was planning to reclaim the presidency of the Teamsters union by challenging Fitzsimmons, but Hoffa\u2019s son said Fitzsimmons and the mob decided to kill his father to prevent him from taking back the union. Hoffa was vowing to rid the Teamsters of the organized crime elements that he accused Fitzsimmons of permitting to run rampant in the union. The mob was making hundreds of millions of dollars from the union\u2019s billion-dollar Central State pension fund that Hoffa said Fitzsimmons loaned to the mob to help build Las Vegas.",
      "Fox Nation reports the new claim that an informant told the FBI that he was present when Hoffa was killed and said that Vito \"Billy Jack\" Giacalone murdered Hoffa. Such information would likely have been documented in the FBI records, but so far the information has not been released.",

      "The Pope, the State Department, the United Nations and a leading Christian group have all condemned a new major attack on Christians in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which the U.N. says left at least 49 dead.",
      "In the latest attack in a tragic long string of mass murders by Islamist terrorists in both Nigeria and the DRC, the U.N. said rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a sanctioned rebel group allied to Islamic State with roots in Uganda, burst into a church in the Eastern town of Komanda and set about hacking Christians who were worshipping inside with machetes and other knives. The congregation was attacked at 1 a.m. last Sunday morning, while they were on a night vigil, reportedly praying for peace.",
      "The rebels also burnt nearby homes. Nine children are said to be among the dead. Several villagers have been abducted.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"The United States designated the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), also known as ISIS-DRC, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2021. We are concerned by reports of the recent attack on civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo and strongly condemn this cowardly act of violence against Christians in their place of worship.\"",

      "The U.N.\u2019s Stablization Mission in the DRC, MONUSCO, expressed \"deep outrage at these heinous acts of violence, which constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and infringements on human rights.\"",
      "\"The killings are strategic,\" Illia Djadi, senior sub-Saharan researcher for Christian charity Open Doors, who support and speak up for Christians persecuted for their faith, stated. He added, \"The ADF have a very clear aim: they want to turn a large part of DRC into an Islamic caliphate, like the horrific one instigated in Iraq and Syria in 2014 by Islamic State.\"",
      "Contacted by Fox News Digital on Tuesday, Djadi said, \"The presence of Islamic State groups across the region means that sub-Saharan Africa has become the new epicenter of jihadism.\" Muslims are in the minority here; it\u2019s said that Christians account for between 80-95% of the population.",

      "Djadi told Fox News Digital that despite President Trump\u2019s brokered peace deal in the DRC, Christians in the East of the country are still at risk. \"There has been a lot of attention paid to the DRC recently, with Donald Trump spearheading a peace initiative between the DRC and Rwanda, whose rebel fighters the M23 have taken a large proportion of territories in the east of the DRC.\"",

      "\"However,\" Djadi added, \"while government forces are trying to contain the M23 in the urban regions, the rural areas are left undefended. It has left a security vacuum, meaning that the ADF are free to slaughter hundreds of innocent civilians with impunity, with Christians especially at risk.",

      "Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump's 'historic' trade deal with Japan and the advancements in artificial intelligence.",
      "Japanese populist Sohei Kamiya stunned many in the country when his Sanseit\u014d party won 14 seats in Japan\u2019s Upper House elections last week.",
      "\"From supermarket manager to bright political star \u2026 populism has hit the shores of Japan like a tsunami,\" Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital about 47-year-old Kamiya's surprise achievement.",
      "Holding 15 of 248 Upper House seats is not sufficient for Kamiya\u2019s party to submit legislation. However, polling data shows Sanseit\u014d\u2019s impact with younger voters, as Kyodo News reported that more than 20% of voters from 18 to 40 voted for his party.",

      "Inspired by President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership style, Kamiya\u2019s rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to \"blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.",
      "Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump\u2019s MAGA motto, proclaiming \"Japanese first\" as his party promises to strengthen Japan\u2019s culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration.",
      "Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya\u2019s goals of \"protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan\" are \"fairly populist,\" they do not represent \"a radical move towards the right wing.\"",
      "In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, \"are more right-wing than Sanseit\u014d.\" Gatling described members of Kamiya\u2019s party as \"pretty reasonable.\"",
      "Gaitlin said that Kamiya, formerly a reservist in the Self-Defense Forces and an English teacher, \"doesn\u2019t appear to be playing.\" Kamiya \"has been honing his message for some time,\" Gatling said.",

      "Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya\u2019s anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan \"xenophobic\" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. \"It\u2019s not that we\u2019re xenophobic, we are being cautious after seeing your failures,\" Kamiya said. \"You are meddling too much in our internal affairs.\"",
      "Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic \"just doesn\u2019t ring true.\" He explained that the country has \"one of the most astonishing cultures in history,\" formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create \"a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world.\"",
      "Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%.",

      "Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseit\u014d\u2019s desire to turn the nation\u2019s farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. \"The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.\"",
      "While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseit\u014d in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not \"interested in building a coalition government.\" Gatling believes the party\u2019s future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that \"they have reasonable policies.\"",
      "Chang said Sanseit\u014d\u2019s win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has \"been adrift\" since Abe\u2019s 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \"is weak and unpopular,\" and the LDP now finds itself \"in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955,\" Chang said. \"Ishiba is naturally catching the blame.\"",

      "He also said India would face an additional penalty for its reliance on Russian energy and military equipment.",
      "The announcement comes ahead of a Friday trade negotiation deadline that Trump said Wednesday \u201cstands strong\u201d and \u201cwill not be extended.\u201d The president has signaled dozens of other countries will face a new baseline tariff level of as much as 20% \u2014 higher than the already-elevated 10% he announced in April.",
      "Taken together, those tariff levels are at or near the historic highs that Trump initially threatened on \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, a move that shocked the global economy and sent stock markets tumbling.",
      "Trump initially backed down, but has since steadily been reintroducing elevated tariffs at levels not seen since the 1930s, when a protectionist U.S. trade policy meant to boost the economy ended up worsening the Great Depression.",
      "The Yale University Budget Lab said Monday that U.S. consumers face an effective tariff rate of 18.2%, the highest since 1934, translating to an equivalent loss of as much as $2,400 per household in 2025. That analysis came before Wednesday\u2019s announcement of tariffs on India.",
      "While India's 25% rate would be slightly lower than the 26% that Trump threatened on April 2, it is still a sharp increase from 2.4%, which is the average tariff rate applied to Indian imports in recent years. India is one of the top sources of imports for American consumers and companies, with nearly $90 billion of goods flowing in from India last year.",
      "India recently became the top source of smartphone imports, after Apple shifted production away from China to avoid high tariffs and geopolitical conflicts, according to data reported by Bloomberg. Apple alone exported $17 billion of iPhones from India last year.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s May 1 earnings call that he expected \u201cthe majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin\u201d starting this quarter.",
      "Other top U.S. imports from India include chemicals, plastics, leather goods, agricultural products, and metals.",
      "In 2022, India applied an effective average tariff rate of 5.2% on U.S. goods. Oils, cement, stone, glass and machinery rank as India's top purchases from the U.S.",
      "Trump continues to plunge headlong into a tariffs strategy that has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the global economy. Over the past two weeks, Trump has announced new agreements with a host of other countries designed to clarify trade terms with the U.S., but which critics say are beset by vague details and unworkable promises.",
      "Major stock indexes have nevertheless continued to churn higher, in part because some companies are noting that the hit to their bottom lines from the tariffs won\u2019t be as bad as initially feared when Trump first rolled out his country-by-country tariffs in April.",
      "Still, the bilateral trade deals Trump has recently been announcing come with duty levels far higher than the ones that have prevailed for decades. They include 19% tariffs on goods from Indonesia and the Philippines and 15% tariffs on ones from Japan and the European Union.",
      "A deal announced this month with Vietnam puts 20% duties on its products, rising to 40% for any goods rerouted from China."

      "The gunman who opened fire in midtown Manhattan on Monday, killing four people before turning the gun on himself, left a note mentioning \u201cCTE\u201d several times, officials familiar with the investigation told NBC News.",
      "CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is a brain condition caused by repeated injuries to the head, typically over many years.",
      "The shooter was targeting the headquarters of the NFL, which is in the Park Avenue building where the shooting took place, authorities said.",
      "While CTE can\u2019t be formally diagnosed without an autopsy, one-third of former NFL players suspect they have the disease, according to a 2024 report. The NFL first acknowledged the link between CTE and football in 2016.",
      "Former NFL player Phillip Adams was found to have severe CTE after he gunned down six people before taking his own life in South Carolina in 2021.",
      "NBC News spoke with Dr. Aaron Lord, chief of neurology at NYU Langone who specializes in brain injuries, about how CTE changes the brain and a person\u2019s behavior.",
      "What is chronic traumatic encephalopathy?",
      "First characterized in boxers, the condition used to be called \u201cpunch drunk syndrome\u201d and can cause neurological conditions including early dementia, memory impairment, personality changes, and movement disorders similar to Parkinson\u2019s disease, Lord said.",
      "CTE can affect anyone who sustains repeated head injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just about repetitive shock waves to the brain,\u201d he said.",
      "The condition\u2019s link to suicide and suicidal ideation is an area of active study, in part because there seems to be a higher rate of CTE than expected among high-caliber athletes who have committed suicide, Lord said.",
      "Still, experts haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions about \u201cthe incidence and prevalence of this disease in the population, or in specific athletes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new one we\u2019re still defining,\u201d he said.",
      "How is CTE diagnosed?",
      "Without an autopsy, doctors can\u2019t diagnose CTE, and even then it can be difficult to pinpoint because there's no specific criteria to diagnose it, Lord said. An autopsy must reveal evidence of tissue degeneration and abnormal clumps of certain proteins around blood vessels in the brain.",
      "Some patients and their doctors may speculate that they have the disease because of noticeable changes in their moods and behavior. Patients also know if they\u2019ve suffered blows to the head, how many and how severe.",
      "Lord said that a brain MRI on concerned patients might reveal some changes consistent with the disease, but it\u2019s not enough for a diagnosis.",
      "There is some overlap in symptoms with psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Lord said.",
      "Lord has also seen a link between patients with CTE and homicidal ideation and impulsivity as well as other personality changes.",
      "Lord tends to see the disease in older individuals, possibly because of earlier repeated impacts, but even one hit to the head can cause damage, even if that trauma doesn\u2019t result in CTE.",
      "\u201cEven somebody who\u2019s just been in a single car accident and has injured the frontal lobes of their brain can have permanent personality changes and impulse control and psychiatric changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Is there treatment for CTE?",
      "Although there is no direct treatment for the disease, psychiatric medication can help with behavioral control and other symptoms, Lord said.",
      "Not everyone who gets a concussion develops CTE, according to the Mayo clinic. Prevention is the best medicine: Avoiding head injury by using seatbelts or helmets can lower the risk of getting a CTE and other brain-injuries, Lord said."

Josh Green, a former emergency room physician who was elected governor in 2022 after more than a decade in state politics, said he\u2019s giving thought to a campaign in an interview with NBC News last week. (The interview was conducted before Tuesday's tsunami alerts in Hawaii.)",
      "\u201cAmong governors, I think there are probably eight to 10 of us who are elevating in the public dialogue,\u201d Green said on the sidelines of last weekend's National Governors Association summer meeting in Colorado.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind about what the future holds,\u201d Green said. \u201cI would be honored to help whomever. I might even become a potential candidate, but only if I\u2019ve actually done a good job.\u201d",
      "Green no longer practices medicine, but he continues to lean into the lingo as he ponders his future.",
      "\u201cI believe we\u2019re going to have to heal this country in 2028 \u2014 and  maybe beyond, because there\u2019s a lot of conflict that\u2019s been going on, and not just during the Trump era,\u201d he said. \u201cSo someone may want a healer.\u201d",
      "Green was among seven Democratic governors to attend last week\u2019s governors summit in person. A number of other governors thought to be eyeing 2028 didn\u2019t come.",
      "But among the attendees, few others toyed rhetorically with a run with the enthusiasm of Green.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who will be a political free agent after his second term concludes at the end of the year and whose name has been thrown around in a broader conversation around 2028, said he was focused on his last months in office \u2014 though he wouldn\u2019t rule out a run.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m consumed by my last six months. Honestly, I haven\u2019t given any thought, literally, to what I will do when I hang up my cleats this coming January,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cWe have an enormous amount to do \u2026 I\u2019m gonna defer, in terms of what\u2019s next for me until down the road.\u201d",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis was even more tight-lipped.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have anything on that,\u201d Polis said. \u201cI\u2019m, as you know, focused on the National Governors Association and in this work that I do here as governor of the state of Colorado.\u201d",
      "Green, meanwhile, is up for re-election next year and indicated he\u2019d run for a second term. But that didn\u2019t preclude him from entertaining the idea of a run for higher office soon thereafter.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is likely 10 or 12 of us will end up running for president and or ending up in the Cabinet if we\u2019ve really elevated in a meaningful way,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing who actually steps up, and people are able to see us all and see what we\u2019re working on.\u201d",
      "Indeed, governors like Gavin Newsom of California, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, as well as senators like Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have all done little to tamp down speculation about potential presidential campaigns, making visits to early-voting states, pulling all-night speeches or publicly defying President Donald Trump.",
      "Green praised the wide field of potential Democratic candidates in 2028 \u2014 mentioning by name fellow governors Newsom, Beshear and Shapiro, as well as JB Pritzker of Illinois, Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan \u2014 describing the unfolding prospective field as taking shape across \u201ctwo different approaches.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are individuals who are decidedly fighting totally along party lines. And then there are individuals that are trying to stake out some kind of space where they fight for their ideologies and see if there\u2019s a place for achievement and results. And then there\u2019s a gray area in between,\u201d Green said.",
      "\u201cThese other guys, they have a larger national profile, but people are gonna have to appreciate whether they were able to achieve,\u201d Green said.",
      "Green, a Jewish, 55-year-old medical doctor from Pittsburgh, moved to Hawaii\u2019s Big Island 25 years ago after being assigned there by the National Health Service Corps, a government program that sends doctors to underserved communities. He built a life, meeting his wife, raising two children, and entering state politics and serving for 14 years in the state legislature before running for lieutenant governor in 2018.",
      "In 2022, he ran to succeed term-limited Gov. David Ige and won in the deep-blue state. His first two-plus years in the top job have been busy: Most prominently, he oversaw the disaster response to catastrophic Maui wildfires in 2023. He was also out front this week as Hawaii prepared for tsunami waves after a powerful earthquake off the coast of Russia Tuesday. The state canceled an evacuation order Wednesday morning after the state's tsunami alert was lowered.",
      "Green has also expanded reproductive rights and taken actions to counter the high cost of living in Hawaii. He\u2019s also increasingly inserted himself into national issues, for example, taking specific aim at Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom he\u2019s blamed for measles outbreaks.",
      "If he were to run for president, Green would likely face a big task ahead of him to stand out in a crowded Democratic primary, including low name recognition. He might not even be the only Jewish governor named Josh in the race \u2014 though he appears aware of such obstacles.",
      "\u201cAs a small-state governor, you truly have to earn your reputation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get to be on Sunday morning shows all the time.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Imports from India will now face a 25% tariff, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, his latest trade-war declaration in what has become a cornerstone of his second administration.",
      "Writing on Truth Social, Trump said India\u2019s own tariffs are \u201cfar too high\u201d while calling other trade barriers \u201cstrenuous and obnoxious.\u201d",
      "He also said India would face an additional penalty for its reliance on Russian energy and military equipment.",
      "The announcement comes ahead of a Friday trade negotiation deadline that Trump said Wednesday \u201cstands strong\u201d and \u201cwill not be extended.\u201d The president has signaled dozens of other countries will face a new baseline tariff level of as much as 20% \u2014 higher than the already-elevated 10% he announced in April.",
      "Taken together, those tariff levels are at or near the historic highs that Trump initially threatened on \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, a move that shocked the global economy and sent stock markets tumbling.",
      "Trump initially backed down, but has since steadily been reintroducing elevated tariffs at levels not seen since the 1930s, when a protectionist U.S. trade policy meant to boost the economy ended up worsening the Great Depression.",
      "The Yale University Budget Lab said Monday that U.S. consumers face an effective tariff rate of 18.2%, the highest since 1934, translating to an equivalent loss of as much as $2,400 per household in 2025. That analysis came before Wednesday\u2019s announcement of tariffs on India.",
      "While India's 25% rate would be slightly lower than the 26% that Trump threatened on April 2, it is still a sharp increase from 2.4%, which is the average tariff rate applied to Indian imports in recent years. India is one of the top sources of imports for American consumers and companies, with nearly $90 billion of goods flowing in from India last year.",
      "India recently became the top source of smartphone imports, after Apple shifted production away from China to avoid high tariffs and geopolitical conflicts, according to data reported by Bloomberg. Apple alone exported $17 billion of iPhones from India last year.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s May 1 earnings call that he expected \u201cthe majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin\u201d starting this quarter.",
      "Other top U.S. imports from India include chemicals, plastics, leather goods, agricultural products, and metals.",
      "In 2022, India applied an effective average tariff rate of 5.2% on U.S. goods. Oils, cement, stone, glass and machinery rank as India's top purchases from the U.S.",
      "Trump continues to plunge headlong into a tariffs strategy that has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the global economy. Over the past two weeks, Trump has announced new agreements with a host of other countries designed to clarify trade terms with the U.S., but which critics say are beset by vague details and unworkable promises.",
      "Major stock indexes have nevertheless continued to churn higher, in part because some companies are noting that the hit to their bottom lines from the tariffs won\u2019t be as bad as initially feared when Trump first rolled out his country-by-country tariffs in April.",
      "Still, the bilateral trade deals Trump has recently been announcing come with duty levels far higher than the ones that have prevailed for decades. They include 19% tariffs on goods from Indonesia and the Philippines and 15% tariffs on ones from Japan and the European Union.",
      "A deal announced this month with Vietnam puts 20% duties on its products, rising to 40% for any goods rerouted from China."

    "summary": "Older adults who participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, had a slower rate of cognitive decline than people who were eligible for the anti-hunger program but didn\u2019t receive benefits, according to a study presented Wednesday",
    "story": [
      "Older adults who participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, had a slower rate of cognitive decline than people who were eligible for the anti-hunger program but didn\u2019t receive benefits, according to a study presented Wednesday.",
      "Although many adults begin to mentally slow down in midlife, researchers found that people over 50 who participated in SNAP, which helps people with low incomes afford groceries, had a 10% slower rate of decline in their memory and thinking skills compared with their peers.",
      "That\u2019s equal to gaining two to three additional years of cognitive health over 10 years, said Linlin Da, lead author of the study, who presented her findings Wednesday at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Toronto.",
      "By providing a secure source of food, SNAP \u201cmay have some underappreciated benefits for brain health,\u201d said Da, who led the study while she was a doctoral student at the University of Georgia College of Public Health.",
      "The National Institutes of Health-funded study comes just weeks after President Donald Trump signed legislation that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will cut funding for SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, by $186 billion through 2034. Food banks across the United States are already struggling to meet growing demand amid funding cuts from the Agriculture Department.",
      "Food insecurity \u201ccan lead to poor nutrition and chronic disease, and all of that can negatively impact the brain,\u201d Da said. \u201cSo by improving access to nutrient-rich foods, SNAP may support brain health, reduce the stress and promote better health overall.\u201d",
      "The new study, which hasn\u2019t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, leaves many questions unanswered.",
      "Researchers didn\u2019t measure which foods study participants consumed, so they don\u2019t know if people receiving SNAP benefits had healthier diets.",
      "But doctors know that high-sodium diets can raise blood pressure, one of the most important risk factors for dementia, said Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer for brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association.",
      "The study also doesn\u2019t explain how food security might benefit the brain, said Elkind, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research. It\u2019s possible that programs such as SNAP relieve the anxiety that people feel when they can\u2019t afford their groceries or when they have to choose between paying for food or medication, giving them more mental bandwidth to focus on other issues. Chronic stress has been linked to a higher risk for dementia.",
      "The design of the new study, which followed more than 2,300 older people for 10 years, can\u2019t definitively prove that participating in SNAP protects brain health.",
      "It\u2019s possible that people who participated in SNAP were cognitively healthier before the study began, Da said. Enrolling in SNAP can be time-consuming and complicated, making it more difficult for people with cognitive problems to complete their applications.",
      "Yet a growing field of research links nutrition, food security and dementia risk.",
      "\u201cObservational studies from around the world have shown us that food insecurity and poor cognitive health go together,\u201d said Kriti Jain, a health administrator at the National Institute on Aging, part of the NIH, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cMore recent studies have shown us that food insecurity comes before cognitive health gets worse.\u201d",
      "Brain health is shaped by far more than genetics, Da said.",
      "Cognitive aging \u201ccan also be shaped by policies, by the environment and by access to different resources,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means we can do something to change it and improve it.\u201d",
      "Anti-hunger groups contend that cutting SNAP benefits will leave people hungry and less healthy. Research shows that poverty and food insecurity \u2014 a condition in which people lack a consistent source of nutritious food \u2014are common risk factors for malnutrition among older adults.",
      "\u201cSNAP is both a lifeline for older adults and a critical public health tool,\u201d said Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group. \u201cParticipating in SNAP can mean extra years of cognitive health, helping older adults remain independent,\u201d instead of moving into nursing homes.",
      "The Republican-led House Agriculture Committee has said the funding reduction \u201crestores SNAP to its original intent\u2014promoting work, not welfare\u2014while saving taxpayer dollars and investing in American agriculture.\u201d",
      "Food as medicine",
      "Karen Forbes, 61, first participated in SNAP decades ago when she was a single mother of a young child. She reapplied for the program during the pandemic when her pet sitting customers stopped needing her.",
      "Forbes, who lives outside Portland, Oregon, said SNAP has been especially important since she developed long Covid in 2022, which has left her with heavy fatigue, prevents her from working and has caused \u201cbrain fog\u201d that resembles age-related cognitive decline. Forbes said she and her father, who is 82, \u201care going through a sort of Alzheimer\u2019s thing together.\u201d",
      "Although Forbes said she used to talk \u201ca million miles a minute,\u201d she now often struggles to find the right word. If she tries to speak too quickly, \u201ceverything comes out jumbled and stupid.\u201d After an 18-month wait, Forbes said she recently began receiving disability benefits from Social Security.",
      "Because of SNAP, Forbes said, she doesn\u2019t have to choose between buying groceries and paying her rent or electric bills. Her favorite part of SNAP is being able to afford fresh fruits and vegetables, she said. Oregon\u2019s SNAP program provides \u201cdouble benefits\u201d for shopping at farmers markets, so people can buy twice as much fresh produce for the same amount of money. Forbes said she tries to follow a healthy diet in the hope of overcoming her illness.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re chronically ill, every little tiny thing you can do to improve your health makes all the difference in the world,\u201d she said.",
      "Food insecurity linked to dementia",
      "Jain described food insecurity as \u201ca severe and growing public health issue in America.\u201d",
      "In families with member over age 60, the prevalence of food insecurity has almost doubled in the past two decades. Twenty-three percent of such families faced chronic or recurring food insecurity from 2015 to 2019, according to a survey from the NIH published last year in JAMA Health Forum.",
      "Another study published last year found that food insecurity doubled the risk of probable cognitive decline.",
      "And a paper published in 2024 in the Journal of Nutrition found that adults with food insecurity and lower-quality diets had significantly steeper declines in cognitive scores during the study, conducted from 2012 to 2020. In that study, however, participating in SNAP wasn\u2019t related to the rate of mental decline, suggesting that SNAP alone \u201cmay be insufficient to prevent negative cognitive effects of poor diet and limited access to nutritious foods.\u201d",
      "Unprecedented cutbacks",
      "The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on social and economic policy, estimates that funding cuts could lead 22.3 million families to lose some or all of their food benefits.",
      "The 20% decrease in funding is \u201cthe largest cut to SNAP in history,\u201d according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank. The measure will also shift much of the program\u2019s cost from the federal government to the states beginning in 2028, as well as expand work requirements for participants.",
      "Seven in 10 of the 42 million people who participate in SNAP are older adults, people with disabilities and families with children.",
      "The new study suggests \u201cwe need more research on the role of healthy diet and nutrition in brain health,\u201d Elkind said. \u201cIn particular, it suggests that there should be more research in the area of food as medicine, meaning the provision of healthy food to people to see what the impact is on cognition, dementia risks and brain health.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When Martin Goebel walks into his St. Louis furniture business each morning, he peels back the blue tarps he used to cover his machines and half-finished furniture the night before.",
      "He\u2019d much rather be sketching designs, brainstorming with clients and making new pieces for his business, Goebel Furniture. But his creative work and growth plans have taken a back seat since 2021, when, he said, a storm tore through his building, leaving lasting damage and, as he puts it, thrusting him into a legal battle with his insurance provider.",
      "The storm ripped off part of his roof, exposing the space to every weather event since then, Goebel said. In St. Louis, that\u2019s no small threat \u2014 the city experiences 40 to 50 days of thunderstorms a year, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most heartbreaking things to wake up at 2 in the morning and hear rain falling,\u201d Goebel said.",
      "Even tougher for Goebel: He said his \u201cMade in America\u201d company could benefit from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on foreign imports were it not for his insurance struggle. Goebel Furniture was offered several large and highly lucrative contracts, but Goebel said he had to turn them down because of the deteriorated condition of the business\u2019 facility and equipment.",
      "\u201cUnder normal circumstances, they would have been transformative. But instead, we\u2019ve been effectively held hostage by Cincinnati Insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with is not the disaster of the storm; it\u2019s the disaster of the insurance that\u2019s supposed to protect us from the storm.\u201d",
      "Goebel said his policy with Cincinnati Insurance Co. included $1 million in coverage for the building and $200,000 for business personal property. But he claims the company isn\u2019t holding up its part of the deal. Since he sued the insurer in 2021, he has been locked in a legal fight that is headed to court for a jury trial on Aug. 18.",
      "Since he filed his claim, he has received about $50,000 from Cincinnati Insurance \u2014 a small fraction of the amount needed to repair the roof and get his business back to the condition it was before that initial storm, Goebel said. He said the money stretched only far enough for tarps, to replace some machinery and make other temporary fixes. Goebel said it\u2019s difficult to estimate exactly how much it would cost to get his business back to where it was because of ongoing, escalating damage to the roof, the inside of the building, equipment and projects since then.",
      "\u201cEvery time it rains, it gets a little bit worse and a little bit worse and there\u2019s a new leak somewhere else,\u201d Goebel said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Cincinnati Insurance said, \u201cWe believe in paying claims quickly and fairly, and we pay billions of dollars in covered claims each year.\u201d While it said it can\u2019t comment specifically on Goebel\u2019s case, it says in a court filing that based on its experts\u2019 inspections, \u201cthe existence of hail or wind damage is an open question of fact.\u201d",
      "Goebel counters by saying he and his own experts insist a storm was clearly the cause. NBC News\u2019 Climate Unit confirmed a hailstorm did hit St. Louis during the period Goebel claimed.",
      "\u201cIf you buy furniture from me, I can\u2019t just all of a sudden say: \u2018Seems expensive. I\u2019m not going to deliver that today.\u2019 It\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s empirical data as to why this has happened. There\u2019s color weather radar; there\u2019s physical damage. It\u2019s a pure decision.\u201d",
      "That decision, Goebel said, has had devastating consequences. He laid off 75% of his staff and said he took on a second job as an adjunct professor at Washington University to support his business, as well as his wife and baby at home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s killing me. This company is my livelihood,\u201d Goebel said. \u201cThe idea that after all of that education, after all of that effort, after all the sleepless nights, after all the dirt that comes off you in the shower, the thing that\u2019s going to take me down is my insurance company? That\u2019s insanity.\u201d",
      "Cincinnati Insurance is the lead subsidiary of Cincinnati Financial Corp., which reported Monday that its second-quarter profit more than doubled to $685 million, driven by higher premiums and investment income.",
      "Goebel\u2019s case, which was featured on \u201cNBC Nightly News with Tom Llamas\u201d this month, is getting attention in high places. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer reached out to him after she saw a video he posted on social media of water pouring into his building during a recent storm.",
      "\u201cHe is well known throughout our community as being a top-notch furniture producer. There is no doubt about that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was me going: \u2018Oh my God. This is one of our most successful local small businesses that can\u2019t operate because of a failure of his insurance company.\u2019 I mean, it\u2019s truly horrifying.\u201d",
      "The office of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also been in contact with Goebel. As chair of the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee that oversees disaster management, Hawley held a hearing in May intended to expose insurance fraud by major corporations.",
      "Missing out on 'America First'",
      "Goebel, in the meantime, wonders what might have been. He believes his business could have been a model for a potential American manufacturing revival under Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic and trade policies.",
      "But he said his fight with Cincinnati Insurance cost his company millions of dollars in lost revenue, as he has been forced to spend time and money working around the damage and not innovating or growing. He declined to share the company\u2019s annual revenue because of the ongoing litigation.",
      "Goebel holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in fine arts and had an apprenticeship with the legendary woodworker James Krenov. He returned to his hometown to open his own \u201cMade in America\u201d furniture company nearly 15 years ago.",
      "While many competitors import materials and outsource manufacturing overseas, Goebel said, his company is built on using American materials to create high-quality products. He said he has made large workspaces for Nike, corporate conference tables for Tommy Bahama and even a throne for a chieftainess in Zambia.",
      "\u201cI built this company with the explicit goal of being a nimble, forward-looking American manufacturer \u2014 designed to respond quickly to market shifts like those created by the tariff changes,\u201d he said. He believes the government should be helping more with public investment and support in situations like his faceoff with Cincinnati Insurance.",
      "\u201cManufacturers like us are ready \u2014 we have the expertise, the infrastructure and the ambition to expand,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump started his second term with one huge difference compared with his first term: Polls regularly showed majorities of Americans approving of his handling of immigration. In fact, it was his best issue, whereas it had been one of his least popular before.",
      "Six months into his second term, it's still among his best issues, but it's no longer as popular. There has been a clear decline in support for Trump's handling of immigration, with his approval rating dropping across a handful of prominent polls.",
      "The trend mirrors the downtick in his overall approval rating as the administration has pursued an aggressive set of policies resulting in many arrests but slow progress on deportations of known undocumented immigrants convicted of major crimes, as well as controversial clashes over deportations.",
      "While Trump still gets good marks on some specifics, including border security, many of his more aggressive specific immigration policies don\u2019t poll well, even as he continues to press on with immigration as a signature issue.",
      "Polls do continue to show immigration remaining among Trump\u2019s most popular issues. But the trend is clear. While most Trump voters remain satisfied with his handling of immigration and other issues, some have told NBC News that they take issue with his approach.",
      "\"For one, I think it's immoral,\" Jorge, 21, an independent from Florida who voted for Trump last year, said in an interview following up on his responses in a previous poll.",
      "He criticized the Trump administration for not \"taking the time to separate the people who do not need to be here, which are the criminals, illegal criminals and migrants, and separating from the working people that benefit our society,\" said Jorge, who declined to share his last name while discussing national politics. \"It's disappointing. ...

      "Inside the data",
      "In poll after poll in his first few weeks in office, Trump's approval rating on immigration regularly eclipsed 50%.",
      "Fifty-six percent of registered voters approved of his handling of immigration in a late January survey as part of Morning Consult's \"Trump Tracker,\" which includes his approval rating on a slew of issues. Other polls found similar results: 51% of U.S. citizen adults approved in a mid-February Economist/YouGov poll, 54% of adults approved in a late February CBS/YouGov poll, and 51% of adults approved in an early March CNN poll.",
      "But across each of those polls, there has been a clear downward trend as more Americans are souring on Trump's handling of that major issue. Some of the movement is within polls' margins of error, but overall, they consistently show a measure of decline.",
      "In CNN\u2019s mid-July poll, just 42% of adults approved of Trump's handling of immigration, while 45% of adults said the same in an early July Economist/YouGov poll, as did 41% in a late June Quinnipiac University poll.",
      "While narrowly half or more still approved of Trump's handling of the issue in the most recent Morning Consult (51%) and CBS/YouGov (50%) polls from mid-July and late June, respectively, months of surveys by both found the same trend of slightly decreased ratings on immigration.",
      "Fox News' poll, however, hasn't changed much. Fox News tested Trump's approval rating on immigration three times, finding it at 47% in April, 46% in June and 48% in July.",
      "That having been said, the landscape remains complicated, especially from a partisan political perspective. When Fox News asked this month which party does a better job on immigration, Republicans had a 6-point lead (52%-46%).",
      "While that's down from the double-digit Republican advantage the poll found in 2022 and 2023, Democrats had the edge when Fox tested the question during the first three years of Trump's first term.",
      "What has sparked the public reaction",
      "A possible reason Trump's broader numbers on immigration have fallen could lie in the administration's policies itself. Even when Trump's numbers on the issue were higher, the harder-edged parts of his immigration policy \u2014 the ones the administration has trumpeted in recent months \u2014 have always polled worse than his overall numbers on the issue.",
      "Then, once Trump started acting on those policies, they drove news coverage and perceptions of the administration.",
      "The Wall Street Journal poll conducted in mid-January, before Trump returned to office, provides a clear example of the pre-inauguration warning signs on an issue that was once a strength.",
      "Almost three-quarters of registered voters (74%) said they supported detaining and deporting only undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of crimes. It was the second-most-popular immigration proposal tested, behind creating a pathway to citizenship for \"undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for many years and pass a background check,\" which 79% supported.",
      "A majority of registered voters also favored increasing the level of legal immigration and the number of H1-B visas available for high-skilled workers.",
      "The public was narrowly in favor of a plan to \"detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants\" (52% in favor); noting that businesses could face worker shortages because of the plan made it slightly less popular. A majority (53%) also backed building a wall along the Mexican border.",
      "By contrast, only 38% favored a plan to detain and deport undocumented immigrants with American citizen children, 31% favored a call to end birthright citizenship, and 26% favored deporting \"undocumented immigrants even if they have lived in the U.S. for 10 or more years, pay taxes on earnings, and have no criminal record.\"",
      "Fox News found a similar thing when it polled voters' views on illegal immigration shortly before Trump returned to office and in late July. Both times, 59% said their views hewed closest to \"deport only those illegal immigrants who have been charged with crimes but allow others to remain in the U.S. and eventually qualify for citizenship.\" Twenty-nine percent said they backed deporting all illegal immigrants, and 11% backed allowing all to remain in the country.",
      "In other words, there's broader support for general promises of deportations or plans focused on removing criminals than there is support for specifically deporting people who haven't committed crimes outside of coming to the United States illegally or people who have American citizen children.",
      "Other, more recent polls have mirrored those findings.",
      "A May NPR/Ipsos poll on immigration found near-majority support (48%) for \"quickly deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798,\" and pluralities also supported a border wall and allowing local law enforcement to detain immigrants without legal status.",
      "But a near-majority, 46%, backed giving \"legal status to immigrants without legal status brought to the U.S. as children,\" and a majority (53%) opposed ending birthright citizenship, which Trump has tried to do by an executive order that has been challenged in court. And the public was almost evenly divided on support for the \"mass deportation of everyone who is in the country without legal status.\"",
      "This week, the Wall Street Journal poll found registered voters close to evenly split on their approval of Trump's handling of immigration \u2014 48% approved, 51% disapproved \u2014 and with similar marks for his handling of illegal immigration specifically \u2014 51% approved, 49% approved. But as in many other recent polls, some specific pieces of the administration's policy poll better than others.",
      "Sixty-two percent approve of \"deporting undocumented immigrants,\" while 36% oppose.",
      "But 58% oppose deporting people \"believed to be here illegally without them ever seeing a judge or getting a hearing.\" And 53% say the \"Trump administration is crossing the line\" with its deportation efforts, while 45% say it is \"doing what is necessary.\"",
      "The sentiment reflects what Latino Trump voters said last month during focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 Deciders series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago.",
      "Most of the swing-state voters who participated still supported Trump and his broad actions on deportations, but a handful of participants criticized the administration's widespread deportations. They said Trump and the government should be prioritizing undocumented immigrants who committed additional crimes over those who have followed the rules since they came to the country illegally.",
      "\u201cHe was going to deport people that were criminals and have backgrounds,\u201d Ruby L., a focus group participant who was born in Colombia and lives in Georgia, said last month. \u201cBut I see that he\u2019s deporting people that work hard and have been in this country. I think he should find a way to help them stay and get a citizenship or something.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When people think of wearables, a few names usually come up: Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit, Garmin. Whoop is usually not on that list: it\u2019s a smaller brand that appeals to a specific crowd as opposed to the Apple Watch and Fitbit users of the world.",
      "And yet, most people, myself included, will inevitably compare it to an Apple Watch. After all, most people will wear one, not both. That\u2019s why I wore the latest Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 at the same time for over a month: to see how they compare, and which one is right for you.",
      "By the end of the month I had a clear favorite: here\u2019s what you need to know.",

      "Whoop offers three products: Whoop One ($199 a year), Whoop Peak ($239 a year) and Whoop Life ($359 a year), each with their own distinct differences in software and hardware.",
      "Whoop One and Whoop Peak use the same physical Whoop band, but Whoop Peak users have more software features in the app. Whoop Life uses the Whoop MG (Medical Grade) band, which has a more advanced sensor with ECG and AFib detection.",
      "Apple sells the Apple Watch SE ($249), Apple Watch Series 10 ($399) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ($799). I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 for this comparison, as it is the closest direct competitor to the Whoop, in my view.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "My experience using Whoop and Apple Watch",
      "Whoop and Apple Watch are very different devices for very different people. Both are comfortable to wear and give interesting and mostly accurate health, sleep and fitness insights. But the experience of using them is wildly different, and highlights how they are meant for different kinds of people. Below are some of the key differences between the two.",
      "Whoop is essentially a screenless watch band. The included band is made of a flexible, comfortable yarn, and the sensor itself attaches to the band with a titanium clasp. It\u2019s comfortable, subtle and easy to forget when you are wearing it, plus it looks relatively normal in more formal settings (unlike some smartwatches). The clasp can be a little finicky when taking the Whoop on and off your wrist. Unlike most other wearables, you can wear the Whoop MG (or 5.0) on your bicep using the Whoop Bicep Band, but it hasn\u2019t been released at the time of writing this comparison.",
      "The Whoop MG gets up to 14 days of battery life, which is excellent. This made it easy to forget I was wearing it most of the time.",
      "You charge the Whoop MG using the wireless charging puck, which slides and clicks into place on top of the clasp. It takes about two hours to fully charge, which is pretty slow. You can, however, keep wearing the Whoop MG while it\u2019s charging, though this makes it much heavier and bulkier. I think you\u2019ll either love the wireless charging puck or hate it. One the one hand: it means you never have to take off your Whoop, even to charge. On the other hand, it\u2019s slow, feels  bulky on your wrist and is easier to lose compared to a more standard wireless charging station.",
      "You\u2019re probably familiar with the Apple Watch, and the Series 10 is similar to models before it. It\u2019s thinner and lighter than the Apple Watch Series 9, but ekes out more screen space by reaching further into the edges of the case. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear daily, and you can choose from dozens of bands to maximize comfort or better fit the occasion.",
      "Improvements over the Series 9 include a brighter screen that is easier to see at off-angles and faster charging \u2014 up to 80% charge in 30 minutes (or 100% in an hour). Total battery life is still about 18 hours, though.",
      "My take: This is mostly about battery life and whether you want a screen or not. I barely need to think about battery life with the Whoop MG, and charging is relatively flexible. The Apple Watch needs to be charged almost daily, but it\u2019s a fully-featured smartwatch, with all the features that entails.",
      "Day-to-day",
      "Whoop",
      "Using the Whoop MG feels like a middle ground between the mostly passive Oura Ring ($349) and the arguably over-active Ultrahuman Ring ($349). It offers some notifications, like reminders about tonight\u2019s optimal bedtime for ideal recovery, but it leaves most control in your hands to open the app and explore your data when you want to, not when the app tells you to. Like the Oura Ring, the Whoop MG has automatic workout detection, though you can also open up the app to manually start and stop workouts as they happen.",
      "Apple",
      "An Apple Watch can be as active or as passive as you want it to be. You can have all your smartphone notifications synced, and get pings every time you get a text, emails or app notification. You can also turn everything off, and treat it as a watch that\u2019s also a fitness and sleep tracker \u2014 it\u2019s up to you.",
      "It\u2019s easy to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch because it has a screen \u2014 you don\u2019t need to pull out your phone. It also automatically detects some workouts, but will prompt you on screen when it does, which makes it easier to know when to start a workout yourself.",
      "My take: I think the Apple Watch is more flexible here. With a couple of minutes in its setting menu, you can make it as hands on or as hands off as you want. Whoop is a more focused product than the Apple Watch, so its day-to-day experience is more one-size-fits-all.",
      "Whoop",
      "My Whoop MG tracked health, sleep and fitness data relatively accurately, and provided a lot more information to dig into than the Apple Watch in most cases, for better or worse.",
      "Sleep data between the Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 was similar, but the Whoop showed my sleep on a more granular level than the Apple Watch, with exact timings on wake windows and sleep stages.",
      "The Whoop MG does have automatic workout detection, but like the Oura Ring, I found myself starting and stopping workouts manually through the app. After my month of testing, I realized that while the automatic tracking is okay, I didn\u2019t trust it enough to risk not logging a workout or having inaccurate data about my runs or gym time.",
      "Apple",
      "The Apple Watch similarly tracks sleep, health and fitness data, but has more convenient exercise tracking than Whoop, especially outdoors. It has its own GPS built-in, so its outdoor walk, run and cycling workouts tend to be slightly (or significantly) more accurate than the Whoop, depending on the environment. It also has more detailed stats for runners like cadence, stride length and more.",
      "Again, because it has a screen, it\u2019s easier to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch. That screen is also useful for confirming or denying its automatic workout detection.",
      "My take: Both wearables track similar things. Whoop has the edge when it comes to sleep and health tracking, while Apple is easier and more accurate for exercise tracking.",
      "Metrics and analysis",
      "This is where things get interesting, and where the big differences between the Apple Watch and the Whoop MG reveal themselves.",
      "Whoop",
      "Whoop has three key metrics placed front and center on the Home tab: sleep, recovery and strain. Sleep is pretty self-explanatory, but recovery and strain are impressive but can be a bit confusing. Whoop assigns a strain score to all of your activities, and charts your strain across days, weeks and months. Strain is scored between zero and 21, which is very specific but can take some mental gymnastics when every other brand is using scales of zero to 10 or zero to 100. The specificity around strain and recovery was interesting to look at, but didn\u2019t feel too different from easy to understand features like Training Readiness and Training Status on some Garmin watches.",
      "The Health tab is where you will find most of the new features compared to the previous Whoop 4.0, and this is where I have the most mixed feelings.",
      "Clicking on the Health tab pulls up a slew of other metrics. You can track your respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and skin temperature. You can see trends in each overtime, from weeks to months, similar to my experience using the Oura Ring 4.",
      "But the biggest new feature is Healthspan. In the essay-length description of the feature on the Whoop app, Whoop calls Healthspan \u201cthe number of years you live in good health.\u201d It gives two measurements: your Whoop Age and your Pace of Aging. Both, but mostly Pace of Aging, fills me with dread and anxiety in a way no other wearable I\u2019ve tested has. I could argue this says more about my relationship with mortality than Whoop, but hear me out.",
      "Pace of Aging \u201creflects how quickly your Whoop Age is changing,\u201d says Whoop in its app. It charts it on a scale from -1.0x to 3.0x, \u201clike a speedometer.\u201d Over 1.0x? Your Whoop Age is increasing faster than your chronological age.",
      "Your Pace of Aging changes weekly, and Whoop would notify me every week that it changed. During my entire test period, my Whoop Age was younger than my actual age (likely a reflection of my fitness activity), but my Pace of Aging was consistently fast, usually at 1.4x. Whoop eventually explained that my Whoop Age and Pace of Aging are increasing because of my sleep consistency, and to \u201ckeep an eye on this trend to stay on track\u201d or else my Whoop Age may increase if \u201cyou keep up with your current behaviors.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the thing: I know why I get between five and 6.5 hours of interrupted sleep every night: it\u2019s because I live in a one bedroom and have a wonderful one year old. I would love to sleep eight hours uninterrupted every night, but most new parents know that that is a pipe dream. So Whoop telling me that my interrupted sleep is speeding up my aging was just frustrating.",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that Whoop Age and Whoop Pace of Aging ultimately cannot truly tell you how fast you are aging. It\u2019s far too complex a topic for Whoop, or any wearable, to track. Aging is affected by a myriad of factors Whoop either isn\u2019t including or can\u2019t track, including diet, lifestyle, genetics, mental health and underlying medical conditions, to name a few.",
      "Healthspan is a buzzy feature that made me open the Whoop app more than usual. But I don\u2019t think a feature that fills me with dread and anxiety is a win, especially one that is more of a suggestion than objective truth.",
      "Apple",
      "By comparison, metrics and analysis on the Apple Watch are much more grounded and reserved \u2014 it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near fitness age or aging with its data. It\u2019s solely focused on giving you your sleep, health and fitness data, without much suggestion or analysis.",
      "Metrics are spread across two apps: Apple Health and Apple Fitness. Apple Fitness shows you all your workouts, and has features like Training Load and Trends that chart things like exercise frequency, move goals, steps, pace and cardio fitness over time. Apple Health has the Vitals feature, which tracks your overnight heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature and sleep duration, and can tell you when your stats are out of normal range, indicating potential illness. Whoop does this too, but unfortunately for my testing (and fortunately for my health), I did not get sick during this comparison, so I couldn\u2019t test this feature.",
      "My take: Whoop MG gives you more metrics and analysis to look at than the Apple Watch. That\u2019s arguably the whole point of getting the Whoop: detailed strain, recovery and health data. My problem is that I either didn\u2019t find the analysis all that useful or it stressed me out (Healthspan). Apple Watch takes a \u201cjust the facts\u201d approach, with little to no analysis (outside of Vitals), just detailed metrics you can interpret on your own.",
      "Value",
      "My take: Normally I wouldn\u2019t harp on value too much: everyone has their own budget, and knows what they can and can\u2019t afford. But the Whoop subscription model is expensive, even compared to a premium product like the Apple Watch Series 10.",
      "A full-priced Series 10 is $399 (though it\u2019s often on sale for less). The lowest priced Whoop subscription is $199 a year. That means after just two years of use, the Whoop starts becoming more expensive than the Series 10.",
      "Everyone I know uses their wearables for four or five years. Four years of Whoop Life, the version I tested, is $1436. That\u2019s more than basically every wearable on the market.",
      "Whoop vs Apple Watch: The final verdict",
      "Whoop is a much more specific product than the Apple Watch \u2014 it\u2019s for a niche crowd who want a tracker with no screen, in-depth analysis and excellent battery life. If that sounds like you, give the Whoop a try \u2014 the brand has a one month free trial (though the trial does not include Healthspan features).",
      "Whoop is not for me, though. If I am wearing something on my wrist, I want it to have a screen so I can use my phone less. The Apple Watch Series 10 is one of the best wearables for anyone with an iPhone, as long as you don\u2019t mind charging it daily. In the long run, it\u2019s also much cheaper than any Whoop subscription.",

Shoe stores usually have specialty tools and an informed staff that can help you identify and consider things like your foot shape, arch type and gait. Some stores can even perform a treadmill analysis of your walk.",
      "Cunha recommends shopping in-person later in the day when your feet are a little swollen. \u201cIf your walking shoes are comfortable at the end of the day when your feet are tired and swollen, they most likely will feel good throughout the day,\u201d he says.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Experts recommend replacing most types of sneakers every 300 to 500 miles, including walking shoes. Make a note of when you buy a new pair, and put a reminder for yourself every six months or so to consider your mileage.",

      "Shvets finds that people with flat feet do well in neutral (or pronator) shoes. She also recommends an insert to help the shoe fit in a more neutral manner. Anyone with a high arch may benefit from a high lacing shoe to keep the ankle stable, as well as inserts like orthotics.",
      "The best way to get a precise determination of your foot type is to consult a podiatrist, especially if you are experiencing foot pains and discomfort, says Cunha.",

      "Eugenics is an evolutionary theory aimed to select \u201cdesired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The movement has a long history, but in the U.S., it historically used \"genetic superiority\" as justification for white supremacy.",
      "The ad\u2019s messaging surrounding \u201cgood genes\u201d feels like a wink to eugenic ideals.",
      "\u201cThem choosing \u2018Sydney Sweeney has great genes\u2019 was not an accident,\u201d one user said in a TikTok video that received over one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog whistle towards the rise of people who are wanting to see more people who look like them everywhere.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment to NBC News. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cheryl Overton, Chief Experience Officer at integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications, says context is important. The promotion \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d she says. Instead, it occurs in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d Overton tells TODAY.com.",
      "While the ad never references race, Hillary Herskowitz, CEO and Founder of H2 Marketing Group, tells TODAY.com there is \u201cno denying\u201d that the phrase \u201ccarries historical baggage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that kind of wordplay with a blond, blue-eyed actress, it can unintentionally reinforce narrow, Eurocentric beauty standards,\u201d she adds.",
      "Whether this implication is purposeful is up for debate.",
      "Overton says the messaging could be the result of a \u201cblind spot of a team lacking cultural fluency\u201d or a \u201cbrand looking actively to cull consumers who value diversity from its base.\u201d",
      "Herskowitz sees the ad as being designed to provoke a reaction.",
      "\u201cIntentional,\u201d Herskowitz says. \u201cThat line \u2014 \u2018good jeans\u2019 \u2014 is too perfectly constructed not to be. It was designed to be cheeky, playful and buzzworthy. The creative team knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Adrienne Alexander, owner of the PR firm IPY Agency, points out the extensive process campaigns like this go through, and says multiple teams likely signed off on the language.",
      "\u201cCampaigns like this go through many hands, including creative, legal, PR, and brand strategy, so it\u2019s unlikely that no one flagged the potential issue. More likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she says.",
      "The ad has also garnered criticism for sexualizing Sweeney. Some say the ad\u2019s close-up shots of the actor seem to objectify her and cater to the male gaze.",
      "\u201cAre we selling jeans to women or selling women in jeans to men?\u201d one user commented on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram.",
      "The limited edition Sydney Jean, produced with Sweeney, has a butterfly motif on the back pocket representing domestic violence awareness, per a press release from the company, and the entirety of the purchase price will be donated to the Crisis Text Line.",
      "Marketing professor Melissa Murphy calls the juxtaposition of the sexual nature of the ads, plus the domestic violence tie-in, \"mismatched\" tonally.",
      "Some viewers have also pointed out that the ad feels reminiscent of a controversial Calvin Klein campaign from 1980 featuring a teenage Brooke Shields.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing,\u201d the then 15-year-old model said in the ad as the camera panned her entire body.",
      "The moment caused an uproar for holding sexual implications and taking advantage of the young star. Shields later spoke out about the moment, saying she was unaware of the ad\u2019s meaning.",
      "Like the Calvin Klein ad, which Klein once said put the company on the map, American Eagle has seen increased chatter following the campaign\u2019s debut.",
      "According to Herskowitz, controversy can \u201cdrive brand momentum.\u201d But was the controversy intentional?",
      "Murphy, doubts it, and so calls the ad campaign, and its lack of diversity, a \u201cmiss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey should have done (the ad) with multiple people \u2014 that would definitely resonate better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t more, and this is just it, then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"

      "\"Breaking Bad\" and \"Better Call Saul\" creator Vince Gilligan is launching a brand new sci-fi drama called \"Pluribus.\"",
      "The show, starring Rhea Seehorn, already been picked up for two seasons by Apple TV+.",
      "Here\u2019s everything we know so far about the highly anticipated series, including plot details, confirmed cast and when we might finally get to watch it.",
      "What is Vince Gilligan\u2019s New Show About?",
      "While Apple TV+ is keeping tight-lipped about the exact plot, Gilligan has teased that this show is a psychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque, where the world shifts drastically in the very first episode. The show won\u2019t revisit cartels or criminal empires, but it\u2019s still designed to mess with your mind (in the best way).",
      "Gilligan told Deadline the series will \u201cbend reality\u201d by exploring human nature through a character-driven, philosophical lens, likening the tone to \"The Twilight Zone.\" Expect a world that feels familiar but isn\u2019t quite right.",
      "And though it avoids the crime underbelly that defined his earlier work, longtime fans can still expect Gilligan\u2019s signature touches: moral tension, complex characters and flashes of dark, unexpected humor.",
      "This time, though, the angle is more hopeful. \u201cAfter 15 years of antiheroes,\u201d Gilligan said, \u201cI figured it was time to write something about someone trying to be good.\u201d",
      "Who Is in Vince Gilligan\u2019s New Show?",
      "Right now, Rhea Seehorn is the confirmed lead. The Emmy-nominated actor, best known for her breakout role as Kim Wexler in \"Better Call Saul,\" is joined by Karolina Wydra, who will play Ana, a character described as optimistic (though knowing Gilligan, we can expect that might not last long).",
      "Seehorn recently shared her excitement about the project with Deadline, saying, \u201cIt really swings for the fences. I had so much fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome of the stuff that audiences have loved about (Gilligan\u2019s) writing: really rich characters, playing with tropes and genres, injecting humor into very dark moments. In this new show, he pushes that to a limit that was both very thought-provoking and upsetting sometimes, and other times, so, so funny,\u201d she added.",
      "In another interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she revealed that Gilligan wrote the role specifically for her \u2014 and that it\u2019s \u201cextremely unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before.\u201d The character, described as a \u201cdamaged but well-intentioned hero,\u201d offers a departure from her past work.",
      "Additional casting details are still under wraps, but the project is already reuniting Gilligan with several of his longtime collaborators both on and off screen. More familiar faces could still be on the way \u2014 and fans are definitely watching closely.",
      "Is There a Trailer?",
      "Yes, and it\u2019s as weird and wonderful as fans might hope.",
      "The first teaser for \"Pluribus,\" released on July 25, 2025, opens with a woman (not Seehorn) slowly licking donuts in what appears to be an office or factory setting.",
      "The camera then pans to a sign that reads \u201cHelp Yourself,\u201d signed with a hand-drawn smiley face before revealing the show\u2019s title.",
      "The smiley face has been part of the show's ads before. On July 22, streamer shared a cryptic post on X featuring a petri dish with an eerie smile, captioned \u201cHappiness is Contagious.\u201d",
      "Combined with the teaser\u2019s surreal tone, fans are already speculating that this unsettling smile may be central to the show\u2019s mystery.",
      "When Does 'Pluribus' Come Out?",
      "\u2018Pluribus\u2019 will officially premiere November 7, 2025 on Apple TV+."

      "One of Trump's top allies in Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has been a big proponent of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, has gone so far as to call the situation in Gaza a \u201cgenocide.\u201d And she publicly slammed one of her GOP colleagues, Rep. Randy Fine, of Florida, for saying Gazans should \u201cstarve away\u201d until the hostages held by Hamas are released.",
      "Greene, who led a 2023 resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., over tweets criticizing the Israeli government and supporting Palestinians, represents a small but growing faction of congressional Republicans who are expressing outrage at the starvation in Gaza.",
      "Asked by NBC News on Tuesday about Trump\u2019s rhetoric on Gaza and calls for food centers, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said, \u201cI think that I share the president\u2019s view.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you see people hurting in a need like that, is to want to help meet that need and alleviate that pain,\u201d Thune said at his weekly press conference. \u201cI think all of us want to see, obviously, a peaceful solution there that gets the hostages freed and ends the reign and rule of Hamas in the region. But in the meantime, do everything we can to ease the pain and the hunger that\u2019s afflicting so many of the people in that region.\u201d",
      "But other Republicans said they disagreed with Greene and suggested that additional aid, if it is given at all, should be conditioned on the release of hostages. Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said \u201cno,\u201d he does not believe there is a genocide in Gaza and \u201cno,\u201d Congress shouldn\u2019t be doing more to help provide relief. Sen. Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, said it\u2019s \u201cbetween the other governments\u201d to solve and doesn\u2019t think Congress should provide additional aid.",

Ending this hunger crisis will not only spare the lives of children but will strip Hamas of its ability to use innocent children as pawns in their depraved acts of barbarism.\"",

They\u2019re just people that hate Israel. And one of the astounding things to me as a result of this war, I see it not just in the United States, but I see it worldwide, is how much antisemitism there is in the world.\u201d",

You don\u2019t want people starving,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019ve been over to Kfar Aza. I\u2019ve been in Israel, Kfar Aza, which is half a mile from Gaza. I watched what happened to people because of what Hamas did. It\u2019s despicable. Hamas could end this today.\"",
      "Gaza was a major topic Tuesday on Capitol Hill, where Senate Republicans were working to confirm more of Trump's nominees, while House members were at home in their districts. Several Republican senators declined to answer any questions about Gaza on Tuesday, including Sens. Jim Risch of Idaho, Todd Young of Indiana and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are mostly unified in expressing alarm over the growing crisis in Gaza. Forty of them sent a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday calling for a wide-scale expansion of humanitarian aid.",
      "Sen. Jacky Rosen, of Nevada, who helped spearhead the letter, said that they want the hostages to be released but that the U.S. still needs to address the suffering in Gaza in the meantime.",

And at the same time, we have to be sure that we address the suffering in Gaza, that there are innocent people, again, being tortured by Hamas and used by Hamas,\u201d she said.",
      "Sen. Angus King, I-Vt., who caucuses with Democrats, said Monday that he is \"through voting for support for Israel as long as there are starving children in Gaza that have been caused by Israel\u2019s action or inaction with regard to humanitarian relief.\"",
      "King added that he wants to see Trump's proposal, \"but the real onus of this is on Israel.\u201d",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said that if Republicans are forcing senators to stay in Washington over the August recess to confirm more nominees, they should be holding hearings on the crisis in Gaza.",

      "And Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., called current relief efforts insufficient, saying \u201cthe notion that you\u2019re going to have just a handful, tiny handful of sites distributing food sufficient for this population is a complete and kind of brutal fantasy.\u201d",
      "He also criticized the Israeli government, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing that the Netanyahu government, not the Israeli people, but the Netanyahu government has choked off humanitarian aid since virtually the very beginning, but most brutally recently.\u201d",
      "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has been an outspoken supporter of Israel, said on X that \"the suffering in Gaza is crushing and real.\" But he told NBC News that he places the blame squarely on Hamas for the crisis in Gaza.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday appeared to reverse his attempt to seize sweeping powers over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Saying he heard the concerns of his people and Western backers, he has now introduced a law that he said would guarantee their independence \u2014 and the agencies themselves said they were satisfied.",

    "story": [
      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

    "story": [
      "Standing around 10 feet tall, weighing around 220 pounds and with an axe-like beak capable of delivering devastating strikes, the terror bird would have proved a formidable foe for most creatures.",
      "But around 13 million years ago, one of them may have fallen prey to an even larger creature, a team of paleontologists in Colombia have discovered after examining bite marks in a fossilized bone of one of the fearsome birds.",
      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

    "story": [
      "The earthquake that struck Russia\u2019s eastern Kamchatka region and triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific is among the most powerful temblors to have been recorded in modern history.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) may revise the magnitude of the earthquake, but if it remains at 8.8, this quake would be tied with the sixth strongest ever, which struck central Chile in 2010, killing more than 500 people and destroying over 370,000 homes.",
      "Russian authorities have called the latest quake a \u201cremarkable event.\u201d",
      "It struck at a depth of an estimated 13 miles, about 74 miles off the coast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the regional capital on the Kamchatka Peninsula, with a population of 180,000.",
      "Despite its strength, early reports indicate that there have been no deaths or significant damage from the event and that recorded tsunami waves reached a maximum of 9.8 to 13.1 feet in Russia, 4.9 feet in Japan and 5.7 feet in Hawaii.",
      "David Tappin, principal researcher at the British Geological Survey, said he\u2019s surprised by this.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw it was 8.8, I must admit, I thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going back to maybe Japan,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake that triggered a huge tsunami, killing more than 20,000 people and causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Now referred to as the \u201cGreat Tohoku Earthquake,\u201d it had a magnitude of 9.1, the fourth most powerful ever recorded. The waves from that tsunami reached as high as 130 feet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, hitting the coast at a height of about 50 feet.",
      "\u201cAt the present time, it seems quite anomalous. 8.8 magnitude generating a 4-meter tsunami seems very unusual but \u2026 the information on the tsunami impact is still quite limited,\u201d Tappin said, adding that he would have expected a tsunami of at least 10 meters, or about 33 feet.",
      "He said the relatively insignificant damage reported so far could be due to the remoteness of the epicenter and the effectiveness of the warning systems.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the warning system kicked in, and warnings were given in Japan initially, Hawaii and off the West Coast of the U.S. So it just demonstrates the importance of having these warning systems,\u201d Tappin said. \u201cIn this instance, perhaps the tsunami wasn\u2019t large, but it saves people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "The fifth-strongest earthquake ever recorded, a 9.0 tremor, also hit the Kamchatka region in 1952. Its epicenter was less than 19 miles from this one. In that disaster, the waves reached up to 50 feet and killed at least 1,790 people, with some historians putting the death toll as high as 8,000, according to the Russian Military Historical Society.",
      "The region has experienced nearly 700 earthquakes with magnitudes over 5.0 since 1990, according to the USGS.",
      "The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the magnitude-9.5 \u201cValdivia\u201d or \u201cGreat Chilean\u201d earthquake, which hit central Chile in 1960, killing more than 1,600 people and leaving 2 million homeless.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most deadly earthquakes was the third most powerful ever recorded, which struck off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on Boxing Day in 2004. The 9.1-magnitude quake triggered massive tsunamis reaching up to 100 feet and killed an estimated 280,000 people."

      "Trump, who has often talked about his \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with the North Korean leader, has met with him in person three times and has expressed openness to the resumption of diplomacy.",
      "Though Trump and Kim signed an agreement in principle about denuclearization at their Singapore summit in 2018, talks broke down the next year after the United States refused to grant North Korea sanctions relief.",
      "North Korea has since advanced its nuclear and ballistic missile programs through weapons testing and a security partnership with Russia \u2014 changes alluded to by Kim Yo Jong.",
      "The State Department said last month that the Trump administration remained committed to achieving the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of North Korea.",
      "The White House did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment overnight. A White House official told Reuters that denuclearization remained the goal.",
      "The office of South Korea\u2019s new president, Lee Jae-myung, said Tuesday that South Korea supports the idea of renewed U.S.-North Korea talks.",
      "South Korea and the United States \u201cwill continue to engage in close communication and cooperation on overall North Korea policy, including the potential resumption of U.S.-North Korea dialogue,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "Kim\u2019s statement was her second in as many days, after she rejected efforts at outreach by Lee, who is seen as more open to repairing relations with the North than his conservative predecessor.",
      "\u201cNo matter what policy is adopted and whatever proposal is made in Seoul, we have no interest in it and there is neither the reason to meet nor the issue to be discussed,\u201d she said in the statement Monday.",
      "She also criticized South Korea\u2019s \u201cblind trust\u201d in its longtime U.S. alliance and upcoming joint military exercises that North Korea sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who is in charge of handling relations with the North, said Monday that he would recommend reducing or suspending the U.S.-South Korea drills to promote engagement with Pyongyang.",
      "The rare twin statements from Kim Yo Jong reflect \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s intent to take an initiative in leading the conversation on the Korean Peninsula issue, whether through dialogue or confrontation,\u201d Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said in an interview.",
      "The message to South Korea used relatively moderate language, Yang said, while the U.S. message implied the potential for talks on nuclear arms reduction rather than denuclearization, suggesting North Korea is trying to gauge the response from both countries.",
      "The fact that Kim acknowledged the relationship between Trump and her brother \u201csuggests both a desire to prevent further deterioration of the situation and a possible signal for another summit,\u201d Yang said."

      "The ruling was announced by a judge in Bogota, the country\u2019s capital, following a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law and order leader of having links to a paramilitary group founded by ranchers in the 1990s.",
      "In a lengthy ruling that lasted more than ten hours, Judge Sandra Heredia said there was enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer, to coax three former members of paramilitary groups who were in prison into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a left-wing senator who had launched a probe into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "The case dates back to 2012, when Uribe filed a libel suit against Cepeda, with the Supreme Court. But in a surprise twist the high court dismissed charges against Cepeda and launched an investigation against Uribe in 2018.",
      "Uribe faces up to 12 years in prison for the crimes he has been charged with. A sentencing will be delivered in a separate hearing. The former president is expected to appeal the ruling in a high court."

    "story": [
      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

      "His comments came amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from malnutrition under Israel\u2019s military offensive on the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces began limited pauses in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza on Sunday for 10 hours a day. But aid groups have warned the trickle of aid entering the enclave is not enough to stave off famine.",
      "'Those children look very hungry'",
      "Speaking in Scotland, Trump said that the U.S. would set up food centers in Gaza as \u201cwe have to get the kids fed.\u201d He disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s assessment that there is \u201cno starvation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Trump said that he had seen images of Palestinians on TV and that \u201cthose children look very hungry.\u201d He later added that the scenes were \u201creal starvation\u201d and that \u201cyou can\u2019t fake that.\u201d",
      "His views were echoed by Vice President JD Vance, who said in response to a question from NBC News on a trip to Canton, Ohio, that the Trump administration was \u201cvery worried about the humanitarian problem in Gaza\u201d and wanted to make sure starving children got food.",
      "The partial easing of restrictions in Gaza under the new round of \u201ctactical pauses\u201d has done little to quell fears about the spiraling hunger crisis.",
      "\u201cThis is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,\u201d United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned in a statement.",
      "Sunday's aid deliveries were a \"drop in the ocean\" and the days ahead will be \"make or break\" in addressing the hunger crisis, Fletcher told British broadcaster BBC News on Monday.",
      "His warnings were echoed by others as the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave said Monday that 14 deaths over the past 24 hours were attributed to \u201cfamine and malnutrition,\u201d with two children among those killed.",
      "That brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition up to 147, including 88 children, since the war began, the health ministry said, with most of those recorded in recent months, according to statements from the United Nations. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "Trump, speaking either side of a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, said that the U.S. would be working with its European partners to address the crisis in Gaza. He offered few other details about the plan.",
      "Humanitarian groups and doctors have warned for weeks of mounting malnutrition in Gaza, with Israel allowing only a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food in since May when it lifted its blockade barring the entry of aid into the enclave.",
      "Just under 30 aid packages carrying food were airdropped over Gaza on Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed scores of Palestinians running toward a handful of parachutes dotting the sky in northern Gaza, which COGAT said was airdropped in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",
      "Abdul Rahman Al-Kahlout, 18, said he waited for hours under the blazing sun in hope of reaching the supplies before they ran out.",
      "\"We died in the sun for four hours,\" Al-Kahlout said. He described shots being fired and soldiers surrounding Palestinians as they waited for the aid several times. He said he feared he was \"going to die for flour.\"",
      "More than 1,000 people, including children, have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for and trying to reach aid since a new distribution system was implemented in late May, led by the controversial U.S. and Israel-backed group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Health officials in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed at least 41 Palestinians from late Saturday into Sunday, including 26 people who were seeking aid, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Facing growing pressure from the global community, Israel has sought to justify both its restrictions and the introduction of a new distribution system by arguing that Hamas has been diverting aid from civilians in the enclave throughout the war.",
      "But an internal U.S. government analysis has found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas, according to a report presented to State Department officials and later seen by NBC News. The IDF dismissed the report as \"biased.\"",
      "The World Food Program said Sunday that it had enough food in and on its way to the region to feed the entire population of Gaza \"for almost three months,\" if enabled to do so, as it warned that a \"third of the population\" is still \"not eating for days.\""

      "Shi Yongxin, the temple\u2019s abbot since 1999, has had his ordination certificate revoked, China\u2019s state-backed Buddhist Association said in a statement Monday, citing allegations that he embezzled and misappropriated project funds and temple assets.",
      "Shi, 59, also broke his vow of celibacy, having \u201cimproper relationships\u201d with women over a long period of time and fathering at least one child out of wedlock, the temple said in a separate statement Sunday.",

The allegations included beatings that left bruises and cuts, psychological abuse and the denial of necessities such as food or bathroom access.",

Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",

      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

      "Tadej Poga\u010dar blasted his way to a fourth Tour de France victory on Sunday, besting rival Jonas Vingegaard by 4:24 across the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es finish line.",
      "Billed as a clash between two titans, this year\u2019s race was filled with ghosts of Poga\u010dar\u2019s past, including the Hautacam, Mont Ventoux and the Col de la Loze climbs, where he had lost significant time in previous Tours to Vingegaard.",
      "This year, Poga\u010dar, of UAE Team Emirates XRG, conquered them all.",
      "\u201cJust speechless to win the Tour de France. This one feels especially amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust super proud that I can wear this yellow jersey.\u201d",
      "Vingegaard, of Denmark, suffered significant time losses early in the race beginning with his botched performance during the Stage 5 time trial. He crossed the finish 1:20 behind Poga\u010dar, who continued to build a steady time gap that eventually became too large for Vingegaard to overcome.",
      "Despite launching attack after attack and maintaining an upbeat attitude during interviews, Vingegaard, of Visma\u2013Lease a Bike, proved to be a mere mortal compared to Poga\u010dar\u2019s superhuman prowess.",
      "\u201cBattling against Jonas was a tough experience, but I must say to him, respect and big, big congratulations to him for his fight and incredible race,\u201d Poga\u010dar said.",
      "As of Sunday, two-time Tour winner Vingegaard has finished runner-up to Poga\u010dar three times. He will next take on the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Spain\u2019s grand tour, in August.",
      "His teammate, Belgian rider Wout van Aert, won Sunday\u2019s rainy stage, which featured three climbs around Montmartre instead of the traditional ceremonial ride into Paris. Van Aert stunned onlookers in the last kilometer around the hill, known for its artistic history and the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, as he dropped Poga\u010dar in a final attack on the steepest section.",
      "\u201cWe came to this tour with ambition to also win the yellow jersey, but the strongest rider in the race and biggest rider on the road won,\u201d said van Aert. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how we raced as a team, how we kept trying every day.\u201d",
      "German climber Florian Lipowitz, of Red Bull\u2013BORA\u2013hansgrohe, finished third in the general classification, coming in 11:09 behind Poga\u010dar and taking home the white jersey for best young rider. His podium finish is all the more impressive considering this was his Tour debut. He was meant to be riding in a supportive role for teammate and Tour veteran Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d from Slovenia.",
      "But in the end, Lipowitz, who is 11 years younger than 35-year-old Rogli\u010d, emerged as the stronger rider. And Rogli\u010d, who has crashed out of several grand tours in recent years, appeared happy to just finish the race.",
      "Indeed, this year\u2019s Tour was filled with unforgettable performances by the next generation of emerging talent.",
      "Few people could have predicted the rise of Irish climber Ben Healy, who wore the yellow jersey for two days early in the race after launching strong attacks based purely on instinct. His team, EF Education-EasyPost, came into the race without its team leader, Richard Carapaz, but Healy quickly stepped into the role. He took the Stage 6 win and was awarded with the Tour\u2019s \u201cSuper Combative\u201d prize for what his team described as \u201cexploits\u201d on the road.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing to achieve what you set out to achieve; it is another to do it with a smile,\u201d team sports director Charly Wegelius said in a statement.",
      "Italian sprinter Jonathan Milan, of Lidl\u2013Trek, dominated in the green jersey for much of his Tour debut. The contest for points classification appeared to open in Stage 3 when the reigning champion, Jasper Philipsen, of Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck, was thrown over his handlebars during an intermediate sprint. The Belgian fastman was forced to abandon with a fractured collarbone and at least one broken rib.",
      "Milan and teammate Quinn Simmons, from Durango, Colorado, soon began a relentless campaign to best the remaining sprinters and succeeded. Simmons, donning his iconic handlebar mustache and American flag road champion\u2019s jersey, was seen at the front of the peloton nearly every day for three weeks. He proved to be the perfect lead-out man for Milan, who wouldn\u2019t let rain or crashes slow him down.",
      "In the end, Milan edged out Poga\u010dar in the final points classification and Simmons proposed to his girlfriend \u2014 she said yes! \u2014 after crossing the finish line."

      "Israel announced Sunday it was pausing fighting in some areas of the Gaza Strip to facilitate aid delivery after international outrage swelled in recent days over surging deaths by malnutrition and widespread starvation caused by Israeli restrictions on humanitarian aid.",
      "The announcement issued by the Israel Defense Forces said it would be implementing \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d for the safe movement of United Nations aid trucks and \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d in some of Gaza\u2019s most densely populated areas.",
      "The military\u2019s \u201ctactical pause\u201d will take place from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the areas where the Israeli military is not operating: Al-Mawasi, Deir al-Balah and Gaza City, the IDF said, and will continue daily \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d",
      "Additional secure routes will be in place between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to enable the safe passage of aid trucks, the IDF said, adding it is \u201cprepared to expand the scale of this activity as required.\u201d",
      "Trucks began moving into Gaza from Egypt after Israel\u2019s announcement, with the Egyptian Red Crescent saying the convoy included over 100 aid trucks containing more than 1,200 tons of food.",
      "However, a spokesperson for the Gaza Health Ministry, Dr. Khalil al-Daqran, told NBC News that 25 people had been killed by Israeli army fire so far on Sunday morning, including 11 people seeking aid in central Gaza. Al-Daqran added that Israeli airstrikes across the strip are ongoing.",
      "The World Food Programme welcomed the implementation of humanitarian corridors, saying it has enough food already in the region, or on its way, to feed Gaza's entire population for three months. Gaza needs more than 62,000 tons of food assistance monthly, it said in the statement Sunday.",
      "Israel also said it had air-dropped seven packages of aid into the enclave on Sunday, after inviting foreign countries to do the same. Aid delivery by air has been slammed by international organizations as a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the roadblocks Israel has imposed on overland aid delivery, which remains the only way to get a meaningful amount of food and other supplies into Gaza.",
      "\u201cAid drops are a grotesque distraction from the reality of what\u2019s needed on the ground in Gaza right now. They can never deliver the volume, the consistency or the quality of aid and services that\u2019s needed,\u201d Ciar\u00e1n Donnelly, vice president of international programs at the International Rescue Committee, told the BBC.",
      "An additional six people in Gaza have succumbed to malnutrition in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry, bringing the total to at least 133 people killed by starvation, including 87 children.",
      "The enclave\u2019s wider population of some 2 million is also at risk of mass starvation, aid organizations have warned, slamming Israel\u2019s aid delivery mechanism, which they say is riddled with obstructive bureaucracy, delays and arbitrary denials.",
      "Thousands of truckloads of aid are piled up outside Gaza\u2019s border crossings waiting to be delivered, but Israel says it\u2019s the responsibility of the United Nations aid agencies to distribute inside Gaza, which in turn blame Israel for erecting bureaucratic and logistical hurdles so complex that only a fraction can be distributed across the enclave.",
      "\u201cThe U.N. and international organizations are expected to improve the effectiveness of aid distribution and to ensure that the aid does not reach Hamas,\u201d the IDF said Saturday.",
      "Israel has long maintained that aid restrictions are in place to prevent Hamas from stealing the food, though an internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft of the supplies by Hamas over the past 20 months.",
      "OCHA, the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian aid agency, and the World Food Programme, have previously maintained that they have not seen evidence of Hamas diverting aid.",
      "Israel lifted its nearly three-month total aid blockade in May to allow some organizations to distribute a limited amount of aid, and has maintained that there\u2019s no hunger inside Gaza, with the IDF saying on Saturday that \u201cthere is no starvation in the Gaza Strip; this is a false campaign promoted by Hamas.\u201d",
      "International aid agencies, hospitals and medical organizations, as well as NBC News\u2019 reporting on the ground, have widely documented mounting hunger across Gaza.",
      "\u201cFood crisis in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Jagan Chapagain, chief executive of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said Sunday in a post on X, adding: \u201cEven the carers are not getting enough food to stay healthy enough to care for others.\u201d"

      "In the Zikim area, at least a dozen were killed as they waited for aid trucks, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The latest killings near an aid distribution site come amid what many have described as Israel\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid\u201d into Gaza, a tactic that has contributed to more than 120 deaths from malnutrition and left a third of the population on the brink of starvation.",
      "The criticism is disputed by the Israeli military, which says it has allowed in an average of 70 trucks a day since May. But aid agencies say hundreds more trucks a day are necessary to feed Gaza\u2019s starving population.",
