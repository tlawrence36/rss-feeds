      "The cast of \u201cConclave\u201d has accepted congratulations from generations of big stars backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As the cast of \"Conclave\" descended steps leading to backstage at the Shrine Auditorium, they got a fresh round of applause from staff and crew at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to go with the big ovation they'd gotten moments earlier from the ballroom crowd.",
      "The esteemed group of Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow had enough collective gravitas on their own, but Harrison Ford, who had just presented them the best ensemble award, the night's big prize, also walked among them.",
      "He was among the generations of stars, including the night's other big winners and nominees, to congratulate the elite performers from the papal potboiler as they made their way through the behind-the-scenes winners' obligations at the SAG Awards, with an Associated Press reporter in tow.",
      "A photographer asked the \u201cConclave\u201d winners to stop and pose, and shouted \u201cGet in there Mr. Ford!\u201d",
      "Ford, not wanting to horn in, walked backwards up the steps back on to the stage.",
      "SAG staffers tried to lead the group to their next stop, but they had to wait. \u201cI have to go get my purse!\u201d Rossellini said, and returned to the ballroom. Lithgow went back in too to get his wife.",
      "A gleeful Jamie Lee Curtis descended on the two before they left and gave congrats and kisses to each.",
      "Fiennes walked ahead alone for a moment, and happened on Ariana Grande, whose cast of \u201cWicked\u201d had been up against \u201cConclave\u201d for best ensemble.",
      "'Yay, congratulations!\" she told Fiennes. \u201cI was really happy for you guys I was screaming!\"",
      "She then introduced him to her date, Broadway's \u201cSpongebob SquarePants\u201d actor Ethan Slater.",
      "Next came a station, normally a bar, where the actual SAG statuettes are handed out. (The ones they accept on stage are just props.)",
      "Jane Fonda, the night's winner of the guild's Lifetime Achievement Award, walked up.",
      "\u201cAre you guys just hanging out at the bar?\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI'm waiting for you, Jane Fonda!\u201d Fiennes replied.",
      "Fiennes pulled her aside and quietly praised the call-to-arms political speech she made during the show.",
      "\u201cYou nailed it,\u201d he said, adding that she expressed \u201cwhat no one is saying.\u201d",
      "Rossellini reappeared, gave a big hug to Fonda, and introduced her to the fourth \u201cConclave\u201d cast member in attendance, Sergio Castellitto, who played the vaping Cardinal Tedesco in the film.",
      "\u201cHe was the conservative,\u201d Rossellini said.",
      "\u201cI was the villain!\u201d Castellitto added.",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, winner of best male actor for \u201cA Complete Unknown,\" then showed up to get his statue.",
      "\u201cWhere's Timoth\u00e9e?\u201d Fiennes shouted.",
      "\u201cHey Ralph, how's it going, I was hoping I'd see you guys!\u201d Chalamet said.",
      "The wins for \u201cConclave\u201d and Chalamet threw a wrench into expectations for the Oscars that are just a week away, with Chalamet, Fiennes and Rossellini all nominees. The presumed Oscar frontrunner, \u201cAnora,\u201d was shut out.",
      "Lithgow returned to the group, and when Chalamet saw him he shouted, \u201cHey John, not bad eh?\"",
      "A photographer asked Lithgow to pose with his award, and he held up fingers to indicate this was his third.",
      "\u201cI don't want to boast, but..,\u201d he said with a shrug to the AP reporter.",
      "The group moved along and signed show posters, then made their way to the area where winners pose for press photos.",
      "Actors always say awards are heavy when they get them, but by all accounts the SAG statue truly is. Kieran Culkin made the heft the subject of half his acceptance speech for best supporting male actor.",
      "While he waited for the photo session, the 62-year-old Fiennes did some presses with his award with each arm.",
      "The 79-year-old Lithgow held his over his head with one arm as the photos were snapped.",
      "His wife of more than 40 years, UCLA business professor Mary Yeager, found a bench nearby to sit down after the long night.",
      "The group then stood for virtual questions from reporters at a news conference, and made their way into the official after-party, where they got their statuettes engraved.",
      "Before leaving with Yeager, Lithgow posed with a group of firefighters who had taken on the recent Los Angeles wildfires and had been the evening's special guests, getting a standing ovation when they were introduced before the show.",
      "The firefighters spent much of the night getting similar photos.",
      "During the first break in the telecast, they headed straight past Ford and Jeff Goldblum, who were standing and chatting, to the table where Grande sat with the \u201cWicked\u201d cast, perhaps looking to impress their children with the photos.",
      "They later made their way to Ford, who wanted to talk with them for a while before taking a picture.",
      "With only actors as nominees, the SAG Awards crowd has a high famous-to-not famous ratio, and behind the scenes it's easy to see things like best female actor winner Demi Moore talking to best male actor nominee Adrien Brody as they walk toward the restrooms. Both are also up for Oscars.",
      "The SAG Awards are also a union meeting, and this group, who went on a historic strike in 2023, were asked through fliers at place settings, a video that played during a break, and a pre-telecast plea from their leader to support their striking colleagues who work on video games.",
      "Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, also spoke of the need for legislation putting strict limits on the use of artificial intelligence to create actors' performances.",
      "\u201cAs I look out at our guests I see some of the most deep-faked people in the world,\u201d he said."

      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

The titles of the 12 tracks spell out: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d",
      "Profits will be donated to the musicians\u2019 charity Help Musicians.",

    "story": [
      "The great Roberta Flack has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In an era where popular music is fluid, it is easy to forget the listening world was not always so open. Unless, of course, Roberta Flack's career is closely examined.",
      "Flack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "Flack will likely be remembered for her classics \u2014 \u201cThe First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\u201d and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\u201d among them. As she should be. But her talents extend well beyond the familiar titles.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist, here.",
      "Picking one standout from \u201cFirst Take\u201d is a fool's errand, but listeners would be wise to spend time with Flack's cover of the Leonard Cohen classic \u201cHey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d a strong case for a reimagination eclipsing the original. Her voice transforms Cohen's lament. It's almost impossible to believe this song, let alone the entire record, was recorded over a period of just 10 hours at Atlantic Studios in New York in February 1969. But it was.",
      "Also from \u201cFirst Take\" is \u201cAngelitos Negros,\" performed entirely in Spanish by Flack. It's a song based on a poem by the Venezuelan writer Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco titled \u201cP\u00edntame Angelitos Negros,\" with a title lifted from the 1948 Mexican film of the same name.",
      "The movie navigates interracial relationships when a white couple gives birth to a dark-skinned child. Beyond Flack's soaring vocal performance \u2014 delivered atop a robust string section and nylon-string guitars \u2014 the song serves as an anthem against racial discrimination and a stunning example of the singer's cross-boundary approach to music making.",
      "As the well-documented lore suggests, Roberta Flack's mainstream success story begins when her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger, was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\"",
      "It quickly topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. But her relationship with the song, and her singular ability to bring it to such great heights, was almost kismet. Before recording the ballad, she had real familiarity with it, having taught it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "It is Flack's best-known hit and one of the great love songs of the 20th Century. Flack first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they'd continue to for decades.",
      "Her voice is otherworldly in her recording \u2014 pinpointing a kind of neo-soul R&B that would dominate for years to come \u2014 and she was recognized for it. Flack became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with this one.",
      "The song would win again in the \u201890s, when hip-hop trio the Fugees\u2019 would offer their masterful take on Flack's cover and introduce much of the world to singer Lauryn Hill's gift.",
      "A standard for R&B and jazz musicians alike \u2014 no doubt due to the grandeur of Flack's version \u2014 \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d is her third career No. 1. It's a mediative seduction, Flack embodying each lyrical vignette in her delivery. \u201cStrollin\u2019 in the park / Watchin\u2019 winter turn to spring,\u201d she opens the song, \u201cWalkin\u2019 in the dark / Seein\u2019 lovers do their thing.\u201d",
      "A soulful collaboration with her close friend Donny Hathaway, \u201cThe Closer I Get to You,\" is a reflective romance, both big-voiced and bigger-hearted singers lifting each other up. But despite its splendor, the song's legacy is marred in tragedy: In 1979, Flack and Hathaway started work on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "The '80s brought soft rock detouring for Flack, another experimentation for the innovative performer. \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love,\" a duet with the R&B balladeer Peabo Bryson, is at the intersection of a few genres and simultaneously timeless \u2014 a feat for a song anchored in shimmery, synthetized production.",
      "In her later career, Flack continued to meet the current moment. A great example is \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a glossy pop song with English singer Maxi Priest. It was released on her 1991 album of the same name, which also features a then-contemporary cover of Philadelphia soul group The Stylistics' 1970s R&B hit \u201cYou Make Me Feel Brand New.\""

      "The 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night should offer the final clue in an unusually unpredictable Oscar race.",
      "The other major awards \u2014 including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes \u2014 have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners.",
      "After wins from the PGA and the DGA \u2014 and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards \u2014 Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week\u2019s time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave\u201d won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That\u2019s included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "So there are plenty of questions heading into the SAG Awards, hosted by Kristen Bell from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Can \u201cWicked\u201d make a late push and win the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble? Can Adrien Brody hold off Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for best actor? Can Mikey Madison keep the momentum and win best actress over Demi Moore?",
      "The 31st SAG Awards will be streamed live by Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An official pre-show will start an hour earlier, also on Netflix. Last year\u2019s show, the first to air on the streaming platform, drew an audience of 1.8 million, roughly on par with earlier SAG ceremonies broadcast by TNT and TBS.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d heads the TV categories.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s hit musical hasn\u2019t yet had a major awards win, but the Screen Actors Guild has often favored populist contenders. Also up for best ensemble are \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody (\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d) has won a string of awards, Chalamet (\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d) and Ralph Fiennes (\u201cConclave\u201d) could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) or Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d).",
      "In the supporting categories, Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d) and Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) are the favorites.",
      "In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.",
      "The devastating wildfires that began in early January forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and instead issue a press release. The guild has launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected by the fires. Producers have said the show will honor those affected."

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office instituting a new and narrow federal government definition of the sexes.

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d soared on opening weekend, but crash-landed in its second go-around with audiences.",
      "\u201cBrave New World,\u201d the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%.",
      "While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023\u2019s \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which fell 78%, and 2023\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d which dropped 70%.",
      "The Anthony Mackie-led \u201cCaptain America\u201d installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre-\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d aura of invincibility.",
      "Still, \u201cBrave New World\u201d has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March.",
      "The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins\u2019 \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d the director\u2019s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, \u201cLonglegs.\u201d Adapted from a Stephen King short story, \u201cThe Monkey\u201d opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? \u201cLonglegs,\u201d which launched with $22.4 million.",
      "Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, \u201cAnora,\u201d by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday.",
      "Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if \u201cThe Monkey\u201d doesn\u2019t reach the heights of \u201cLonglegs\u201d ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with \u201cKeeper\u201d this October.",
      "\u201cThe Monkey,\u201d starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low.",
      "As it did with \u201cLonglegs,\u201d Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held Los Angeles\u2019 Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make.",
      "Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Unbreakable Boy\u201d opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease.",
      "\u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. \u201cPaddington in Peru\u201d has been most popular overseas, where it's collected $125 million thus far.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records. Those totals put \"Ne Zha 2\" past \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "The winners will not have any impact on the Oscars, as the voting window closed earlier this week. Some years, the Spirit Awards significantly overlap with eventual Oscar winners, as in the year of \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once.\u201d Other times, it doesn\u2019t. Last year\u2019s big awards season champion \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was too expensive to qualify, and the top Spirit Awards winners were \u201cPast Lives\u201d and \u201cAmerican Fiction.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is an unusual TV medical procedural",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "So was born \u201cWatson,\u201d a CBS series starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character who leads a team of medical detectives set in a present-day Pittsburgh populated with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those blessed moments,\u201d says Sweeny, who was well-versed with the world of Holmes after executive producing and writing for \u201cElementary,\u201d a contemporary update.",
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is not alone among the networks jazzing up the tried-and-true procedural. While the traditional form remains the bedrock of modern TV \u2014 think the prime-time blocks of \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d \u2014 new twists are emerging.",
      "ABC\u2019s \u201cDoctor Odyssey\u201d is a medical procedural aboard a luxury cruise ship and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d mashes up \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d CBS has Kathy Bates in \u201cMatlock\u201d playing an underestimated, retirement-age lawyer \u2014 with the twist that she\u2019s really a hard-charging mom out for vengeance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",

He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink!

      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with.

      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "The name, which is given to the meeting point of the holy Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers, said singer Tandon, came to her in one of her daily meditations.",
      "\u201cIt was a beautiful coincidence that our album called Triveni won the Grammy on Vasant Panchami when the Maha Prayag was going on,\u201d Tandon told RNS, referring to the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela festival held where the three rivers meet in Prayagraj, India, considered one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the nation. The world\u2019s largest gathering of humanity, with 400 million people attending this year, the Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years, with this year\u2019s celebration, the Maha Kumbh Mela, happening only every 144 years, when the sun, the moon and Jupiter align.",

      "Tandon was a prominent business mogul for more than half her life, the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and sister to former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Twenty-five years ago, however, Tandon faced what she describes as a \u201ccrisis of spirit.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had everything, and yet I felt like I had nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I died today, what is it that I want to have accomplished? Is it just more money, more climbing up the ladder, or was there something else that would just give me happiness and make each day complete?\u201d",
      "That something else, she found, was devotional music. Pulling from the mantras she once heard as a little girl in Chennai, Tandon found a new purpose in creating melodies and \u201cpraying into the notes\u201d as a form of meditation. \u201cMusic helped me find myself,\u201d said Tandon, the creator of six albums of her own.",
      "And according to Tandon, the Grammy win signifies a larger cultural moment, helping young people all over the world discover the \u201cextraordinary gems\u201d of the ancient Vedic traditions. \u201cInstead of a traditional Indian ornate piece of jewelry, I\u2019ve simply put them in a completely Western jewelry setting,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s more apparent, it\u2019s more discernible, more relatable. And suddenly there\u2019s this curiosity about, \u2018What is that? It makes me feel so good!\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries. The 21st is no different, they say, as they see a burgeoning space for the spiritually curious youth seeking a respite from the fast-paced internet culture they grew up in. Now, a new generation of kirtan artists is leading the charge on Hindu sacred music.",
      "Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith.",
      "\u201cThis is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone\u2019s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,\u201d he told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they\u2019re doing it.\u201d",
      "Vani, born into an American Hare Krishna family, just performed his first solo live concert at Mumbai\u2019s Royal Opera House in late January. Once the head of the successful early 2000s \u201cKrishna-conscious\u201d rock band As Kindred Spirits, Vani joined musicians from the East and the West for a fusion of world music, mantra, pop and rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about spiritual stories and spiritual music from around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my jam.\u201d",
      "Some form of singing or chanting takes place in almost every Hindu tradition, says Vani, but the bhakti, or devotional, tradition practiced by members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, places an emphasis on music as a way to connect with the Divine, and \u201cas a way to create harmony, peace in the world, peace in oneself and to heal both spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The Maha Mantra, a repetition of the words \u201cHare,\u201d or praise, \u201cKrishna\u201d and \u201cRama,\u201d set to any melody the singer, or kirtaniya, chooses, is an ISKCON staple. This Sanskrit call-and-response, with the names of God sung alongside a harmonium and a mridanga, a type of drum, says Vani, can lead participants to a \u201cflow state\u201d where it may feel like \u201cmusic is kind of descending from the heavens and coming out through you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Vani.",
      "Steeped in this tradition since birth, Vani and his wife, a trained Indian classical dancer, have now surrounded their three teenage children with song and dance. But as Vani has taught his kids, spiritual meaning is not limited to kirtans: \u201cIf you look for it, spiritual music is all around us, in all cultures,\u201d he said, from gospel to Sufi Zikr to praise music from South Africa. And, says Vani, it\u2019s in his daily playlist of Nora Jones, George Harrison, the Talking Heads and The Police. (The latter\u2019s song \u201cSpirits in the Material World\u201d is, he said, a personal family favorite.)",
      "Premanjali Dejager, a 24-year-old \u201cKrishna kid\u201d \u2014 a term of endearment for those raised in a Hare Krishna household \u2014 lives in New York\u2019s Bhakti Center ashram and doesn\u2019t go a day without chanting the Maha Mantra a few times. The kirtaniya, who grew up in Australia, says kirtans can feel like a \u201cspiritual dance party,\u201d where \u201cteenage angst\u201d and \u201cclub dance moves\u201d meet in a safe, nondestructive environment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of it, like, when someone is really singing from their heart and, like, really connecting, you feel that sense of connection in the room,\u201d Dejager, who grew up in Australia, told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s just contagious.\u201d",
      "Dejager has sung around the world with her guru Indradyumna Swami, known as the Travelling Monk, since graduating gurukul, or \u201cspiritual high school,\u201d in 2018. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t always so musically inclined. \u201cI was actually a really terrible singer,\u201d she said, recalling that she was removed from her primary school\u2019s singing group because she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t sing on key.\u201d",
      "Yet taking singing lessons in jazz and pop music grew Dejager\u2019s confidence, and she started posting devotional singing videos on social media, some of them \u201creally cringy.\u201d Today, she has more than 50,000 Instagram followers and her own virtual kirtan school, where she has, since 2021, taught other aspiring singers over Zoom that what\u2019s important is \u201cbeing real,\u201d or coming as you are to the devotional practice.",
      "\u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m feeling really sad or going through something difficult or having to make a difficult decision, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a prayer offering of like, \u2018Krishna, I need your help here. I need your guidance.\u2019 And sometimes it does happen where I\u2019m having to catch myself from like spacing out, and my mind goes everywhere. It is a practice of constantly trying to bring the mind back and just trying to bring my heart into the picture.\u201d",
      "Nikita Bhasin, a California native, considers herself more spiritual than religious. A certified yoga instructor since the age of 17, Bhasin was raised attending and singing devotionals at the Kali Mandir in Laguna Beach \u2014 a common story of being \u201cdragged along by my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI left all the kirtan stuff behind because I was older and I didn\u2019t have to do what my parents told me to do,\u201d Bhasin, 27, told RNS.",
      "But Bhasin eventually found her way back to the music, when she learned yoga from an instructor who began practice with the same chants she heard as a child, but in a \u201cmore digestible\u201d 10-minute format rather than the three hours she spent at the temple. She took up the harmonium and now opens and closes each of her yoga classes in New York, barring if they are in a gym setting, with a Sanskrit chant, often to the theme of the asanas, or postures, such as repeating \u201cJai Ma,\u201d or hail Mother Earth, in a class about \u201cbalancing opposition.\u201d",
      "Many of her students have never chanted before, holding varying beliefs (or no beliefs) about God, some coming only for the physical asanas of yoga. Bhasin invites them to \u201cput their own spin\u201d on the ancient practice.",
      "\u201cA lot of these chants, you are chanting to something higher than yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interpretations of that. There\u2019s thousands of lineages that think of God or divine as something different: Divine could be a hug from your friend, or it could be feeling like you\u2019re not on autopilot and are grateful and connecting with people in your life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, because a lot of people tell me after class that they haven\u2019t sung since they were like 10 years old, and this is how they\u2019re coming back to their body and coming back to this childlike spirit of just letting go,\u201d she said."

      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",

      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, MGM Amazon announced that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control",
      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",

      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in the more than 50-year history of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting a new James Bond film. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cWe are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Oscars are more international than ever",
    "story": [
      "The Oscars are more international than ever",
      "NEW YORK -- For many filmmakers, the Oscars are a pipe dream. But not because they think their movies aren\u2019t good enough.",
      "The Iranian director, Mohammad Rasoulof, for instance, knew his native country was more likely to jail him than submit his film for the Academy Awards. Iran, like some other countries including Russia, has an official government body that selects its Oscar submission. For a filmmaker like Rasoulof, who has brazenly tested his country\u2019s censorship restrictions, that made the Oscars out of the question.",
      "\u201cA lot of independent filmmakers in Iran think that we would never be able to make it to the Oscars,\u201d Rasoulof said in an interview through an interpreter. \u201cThe Oscars were never part of my imagination because I was always at war with the Iranian government.\u201d",
      "Unlike other categories at the Academy Awards, the initial selection for the best international film category is outsourced. Individual countries make their submission, one movie per country.",
      "Sometimes that\u2019s an easy call. When the category \u2014 then \u201cbest foreign language film\u201d \u2014 was established, it would have been hard to quibble with Italy\u2019s pick: Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Strada,\u201d the category\u2019s first winner in 1957.",
      "But, often, there\u2019s great debate about which movie a country ought to submit \u2014 especially when undemocratic governments do the selecting. Rasoulof\u2019s fellow Iranian New Wave director Jafar Panahi likewise had no hopes of Iran selecting his 2022 film \u201cNo Bears\u201d for the Oscars. At the time, Panahi was imprisoned by Iran, which didn\u2019t release him until he went on a hunger strike.",
      "Rasoulof\u2019s film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d \u2014 a movie shot clandestinely in Iran before its director and cast fled the country \u2014 ultimately was nominated for best international film. But on March 2, it will be at the Oscars representing Germany, the country Rasoulof made his home in after being sentenced to flogging and eight years in prison in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe film, to a large degree, is now a German film, both because of the distribution company and because of all the people who worked on it post-production, including myself,\u201d said Rasoulof. \u201cI\u2019m a person who\u2019s been ripped of his Iranian national identity.\u201d",
      "The Oscars are more international than ever. This year's lead nominee, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d is the most nominated non-English language film ever. It\u2019s a Mexico-set, Spanish-language film shot outside Paris \u2014 a reflection of how borderless film can be. (It's France's Oscar submission.) For the seventh year in a row, a foreign-language film has been nominated for best picture. And for the first time, in fact, there are two up for Hollywood\u2019s top prize: \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and the Brazilian drama \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "The historic 2020 win for \u201cParasite,\u201d the first non-English language best picture winner, wasn\u2019t just, as director Bong Joon Ho called it then, a victory over \u201cthe one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles.\u201d It was the sign of a tectonic shift in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. To diversify its membership, the academy has in recent years invited hundreds of overseas voters, tipping the Oscar scales. The Academy Awards have gone global.",
      "And yet the Academy Awards' marquee category for international cinema, best international film, has been continually criticized as unjust, outdated and subject to political interference. \u201cThe Oscars\u2019 international film category is broken,\u201d wrote film critic Alissa Wilkinson in 2020 for Vox. \u201cNothing short of a total overhaul of the category is order,\u201d wrote Variety critic Peter Debruge in 2022.",
      "The academy has sometimes tweaked the category, which was renamed in 2020. In 2006, the academy ruled that international submissions no longer needed to be in the language of its home country. Last year\u2019s winner, \u201cThe Zone of Interest,\u201d was a German-language film set at Auschwitz, but marked the United Kingdom's first best international film Oscar.",
      "To help guard the process from outside influence, the academy in 2023 specified that each country\u2019s selection committees must be at least 50% composed of \u201cfilmmakers, artists and craftspeople.\u201d But who those people are, and what their subjective sense of national identity might be, has often been questionable.",
      "This year, one of the most conspicuous absences from the Oscars is Payal Kapadia\u2019s \u201cAll We Imagine As Light,\u201d an Indian drama that numerous critics have named the best film of 2024. It was the first Indian film to play in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 30 years.",
      "The Film Federation of Indian instead chose Kiran Rao\u2019s \u201cLaapataa Ladies,\u201d a glossier comedy from Jio Studios that the academy ultimately passed on. FFI president Ravi Kottarakara told the Hollywood Reporter India that the jury, which was all male, felt \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d was like \u201cwatching a European film taking place in India.\u201d",
      "Kapadia, speaking shortly after that decision, praised the choice of \u201cLaapataa Ladies\u201d while taking issue with the jury\u2019s metric.",
      "\u201cWhat is Indian? It\u2019s a very big continent that we have,\u201d said Kapadia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Indias. I\u2019m really happy with the film they chose. It\u2019s a really nice film. I liked it a lot. But I feel like these kind of statements, I don\u2019t know what purpose they serve. The committee that made the selection was 13 men. Is that very Indian?\"",
      "Rancor over the Greek selection process led 20 filmmakers to withdraw their submissions for this year\u2019s Oscars to protest the Greece Ministry of Culture's sudden replacement of selection committee members.",
      "Renos Haralambidis, one of the filmmakers who withdrew his film, told Balkan Investigative Reporting Network: \u201cI believe that the committee that will choose which film will be nominated for the Oscars should be independent of the state, because I believe the less the state in art, the better.\u201d",
      "The question for the academy is: Does it want this annual drama in the international film category? Should governments, autocratic or not, have any say in what films are in the running for one of the most sought-after Oscars?",
      "The film academy declined to comment for this article.",
      "These are issues the Oscars have long been aware of. Sometimes, the academy has even lent a hand to a country making its first submission. That was the case when Bhutan established a selection committee so it could nominated Pawo Choyning Dorji\u2019s 2019 film \u201cLunana: A Yak in the Classroom.\u201d It surprised pundits and received an Oscar nomination, Bhutan\u2019s first.",
      "What options does the academy have? It could make its own international film selection committee, like those that exist in other categories, and remove governments completely from the process. Some have advocated for expanding the category to 10 nominees, like best picture, and doing away with the one-nation, one-movie rule. Another option: Keep the current system but allow for several academy committee-chosen slots so that political dissidents aren't ruled out.",
      "Such changes would surely be welcome news to those who believed France last year should have submitted Justine Triet\u2019s best picture-nominated legal drama \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d or India ought to have backed the Telugu-language smash \u201cRRR.\u201d Both picked up Oscars in other categories.",
      "Regardless, it\u2019s clear that geopolitics have increasingly made the best international film award at the Oscars almost as quarrelsome as the rest of our global existence.",
      "For any peace in the category, you\u2019d have to look to the Latvian entry, \u201cFlow,\u201d an animated animal parable nominated for both best international film and best animated film. While it\u2019s nominated by Latvia, it contains no language, at all, just a few meows and some barking.",

      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "He had admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot.\"",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper his client will \u201canswer the judges\u2019 questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties, saying they hope to toughen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",

    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn\u2019t allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral",
      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",

      "Authorities say a gunman entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead",
      "YORK, Pa. -- A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",
      "Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.",
      "Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge loss to our community,\u201d Barker said at a press conference following the shooting. \u201cIt is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.\u201d",
      "Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for \u201ca medical purpose involving another individual\u201d and he intentionally targeted the workers there.",
      "No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.",

      "\u201cWe all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,\u201d West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.",
      "Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile.

      "\u201cTheir willingness to run toward danger helped save the lives of others,\u201d Shapiro said on the social platform X. \u201cI'm grateful to them and all law enforcement who answered the call today in York.\u201d",

      "The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire\u2019s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child\u2019s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.",

    "story": [
      "A former surgeon is going on trial in France for the rape and sexual abuse of 299 victims over a period spanning more than three decades",
      "PARIS -- France is about to hold its largest-ever child sex abuse trial. While just one man is in the dock \u2014 a former surgeon accused of raping or sexual abusing 299 people, mostly child patients \u2014 activists hope the trial empowers other victims and helps expose other abusers long protected by societal taboos.",
      "Central to the trial are defendant Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec\u2019s chillingly detailed notebooks, which he used to document decades of sexual violence.",
      "Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial starting Monday in Vannes, in the Brittany region of northwestern France. He doesn't deny the charges, though he says he doesn't remember everything.",
      "Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time to undergo surgery at Le Scouarnec's hands.",
      "The trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos surrounding sexual abuse. That was highlighted recently during the trial that made Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of others, France\u2019s symbol of fight against sexual violence.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations see the trial as an opportunity to reaffirm that shame must change sides.",
      "\u201cIt should also mark a new step towards a justice system that listens and protects victims and firmly convicts aggressors,'' they said in a statement.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces up to 20 years in prison for rape, sexual assault and indecent acts committed with violence or surprise.",
      "The case began in 2017 when a 6-year-old neighbor denounced Le Scouarnec, who had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedopornographic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces and a young patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec has admitted child abuse dating back to 1985-1986, according to investigation documents. Some cases couldn't be prosecuted, because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine rapes and other abuses committed from 1989 to 2014 on 158 men and 141 women who were age 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to the investigation documents. His strategy was to disguise sexual violence as a medical act, targeting young patients who were less likely to recall what had happened.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the postoperation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital at the age of 9 in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot, but I didn\u2019t think something like that had happened to me during this operation.\u201d",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell as I left the lawyer\u2019s office,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\"",
      "She also described the emotional toll of the revelation.",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec's lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper that his client would \u201canswer the judges' questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "The case could have come to light much earlier. Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child pornography and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time.",
      "Despite this, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the next year. Because of processing delays, the criminal record check requested by the Health Ministry at the time didn't include any mention of his past offenses.",
      "Even after being informed of his conviction, health authorities and hospital management didn't pursue disciplinary action.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties. The lawyer for L\u2019Enfant Bleu association, Jean-Christophe Boyer, said that one key purpose is \u201cto do something, perhaps modify the legal framework ... to prevent this kind of situation from happening again.\u201d",
      "The Independent Commission on Incest and Sexual Violence against Children urged a \u201cmajor cultural change.\u201d",
      "\u201cChild abuse careers are built, not by monsters, but by all witnesses' successive silences,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIt is each witness' duty to take action, and especially each professional in a position of responsibility in a health, administrative or judicial institution.\u201d",

      "A court battle is set to resume over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding",
      "BOSTON -- A court battle is set to resume Friday over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and delay new lifesaving discoveries.",
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the cuts from taking effect earlier this month in response to separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries. Now U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, must decide whether to extend the temporary restraining order blocking those cuts.",
      "The states and research groups say such a move is illegal, pointing to bipartisan congressional action during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term to prohibit it.",
      "\u201cYet here we are again,\u201d attorneys argued in a court motion, saying the NIH is \u201cin open defiance\u201d of what Congress decreed.",
      "In its own written arguments, the Trump administration said NIH has authority to alter the terms after awarding grants and that Kelley\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t the proper venue to arbitrate claims of breach of contract.",
      "States and researchers \u201chave failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury,\u201d according to the administration motion.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded more than 60,000 grants last year totaling about $35 billion. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication. But the waivers only allow PEPFAR-funded NGOs to give PrEP to pregnant or breastfeeding women and not to gay men or sex workers, high risk groups for contracting and spreading HIV. Contraception services through PEPFAR have also been halted.",
      "\u201cThe fight against HIV is not over yet,\u201d said Dr. Kebby Musokotwane, director general of the National AIDS Council in Zambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of progress that has been made, but there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:48:30 -0500",
    "summary": "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:56:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

      "A Philippine village in the densely populated capital region has launched a battle against dengue by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

    "summary": "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
    "story": [
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An unusual series of military exercises by Chinese warships in the sea between Australia and New Zealand has prompted reproval from leaders in both countries about the amount of warning given",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Leaders in Australia and New Zealand say China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries, forcing flights to divert on short notice.",
      "The drills by three naval ships happened in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path over the Tasman Sea on Friday and Saturday, and at least once involved live fire.",
      "There's no suggestion China broke any laws, but analysts say the episode highlights escalating regional tensions over China's influence.",
      "The Tasman Sea spans 1,200 miles (2,000 km) between Australia and New Zealand, the largest Western powers in the South Pacific Ocean. Australia\u2019s government said Thursday that three Chinese warships were sailing unusually close to its shores on an undeclared mission.",
      "The Chinese military task group were in Australia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, the area beyond its territorial waters where a nation has exclusive economic rights. That was \u201cnot unprecedented, but unusual,\u201d Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said.",
      "But on Friday, commercial flights between Australia and New Zealand hurriedly diverted after the Chinese vessels warned pilots they were flying above a live firing exercise.",
      "Live fire from the warships hasn\u2019t been confirmed during Friday\u2019s drills, but firing was spotted by a New Zealand navy ship tracking the vessels on Saturday.",
      "Political leaders from both countries emphasized that China didn\u2019t breach international law, but said the warships should have given more notice before conducting live fire exercises.",
      "The activities also raised eyebrows because they happened further south than usual.",
      "The live fire activities happened on \u201ca couple of hours\u2019 notice\u201d rather than the expected 12 to 24 hours, New Zealand\u2019s Defense Minister Judith Collins told Radio New Zealand on Monday. China was not required by law to give that much advance warning, but after planes scrambled to divert, Collins said officials were \u201cseeking assurance from the Chinese embassy\u201d about future activities.",
      "She said she did not know what the Chinese military planned for the vessels in the coming days. Leaders said there was no danger to either country and stopped short of criticizing China for undertaking the activities.",
      "China is the biggest export partner for both Australia and New Zealand, and the episode follows a period of improved ties between Beijing and Canberra as a Chinese trade freeze on many Australia goods has gradually thawed.",
      "But the latest developments could force the Australian government to rethink its celebration of success on China said Michael Shoebridge, a former Australian defense and security official and director of the think tank Strategic Analysis Australia.",
      "\u201cIf the Australian Prime Minister admits that this stabilization of the Australia-China relationship has done nothing to stop China\u2019s growing aggression towards our military in the wider region, it undercuts their signature foreign policy achievement,\" he said.",
      "Chinese officials vehemently rejected the suggestion that the military didn\u2019t warn of their activities. China\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said Sunday that the vessels \u201crepeatedly issued safety notices in advance.\u201d",
      "Australian leaders had \u201cmade unreasonable accusations against China and deliberately hyped it up,\u201d Wu said.",
      "Shoebridge said China's annoyance about Australia's growing military ties in Asia might be one reason for the maneuvers. Bolstered security ties with Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam, all three of which have territorial disputes with China, have increased Australia\u2019s presence in the region's waters.",
      "Beijing is seeking to isolate those countries at a time of flux in global relations and ratcheting tension between China and Taiwan, the analyst said.",
      "But many also suggested the drills were a demonstration of the Chinese navy\u2019s growing size and capabilities in a region where Beijing is ambitious for a larger presence.",
      "China has keenly sought security deals with small island nations throughout the South Pacific, raising anxiety in Wellington and Canberra about the prospect of fierce territorial contest in their backyards. That's provoked backlash from Pacific leaders, who resent scrutiny of their diplomacy by Australia and New Zealand.",
      "\u201cAnyone who thought there wasn\u2019t a downside to building a military relationship with China now knows that isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Shoebridge. \u201cThe last thing anyone in the South Pacific should want is the Chinese military bringing the tension and aggression they\u2019ve brought to Southeast Asia and North Asia to our local neighborhood.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Germany faces its second change of leader in less than four years after the head of the center-right opposition won Sunday\u2019s election",
      "BERLIN -- Germany faces its second change of leader in fewer than four years after the head of the center-right opposition, Friedrich Merz, won Sunday's election, which saw a surge for a far-right party and a stinging defeat for outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "After the collapse of Scholz's three-party government in November, it's now up to Merz to restore stability to the European Union's most populous country and traditional political heavyweight, which also has the continent's biggest economy.",
      "Merz has one realistic option to form a government: a coalition with Scholz's Social Democrats. His Union bloc and its center-left rival have a combined 328 seats in the 630-seat parliament.",
      "He says he hopes to do the deal by Easter. That's a challenging timeframe: The possible partners will have to reconcile contrasting proposals for revitalizing the economy, which has shrunk for the past two years, and for curbing irregular migration \u2014 an issue that Merz pushed hard during the campaign. That will likely require diplomacy and a readiness to compromise that often weren't evident in recent weeks.",
      "It's still a much easier task than it might have been. For hours on Sunday night, it looked likely that Merz would need to add a second center-left partner, the environmentalist Greens, to put together a parliamentary majority.",
      "The Union and Social Democrats were post-World War II Germany's heavyweights. But their support has been eroding for at least two decades as the political landscape has become more fragmented. Their combined showing Sunday was their weakest since the postwar federal republic was founded in 1949.",
      "The Social Democrats had their worst postwar showing with just 16.4% of the vote. The Union had its second-worst with 28.5%. This is only the second time that the winning party polled less than 30%; the first was in 2021.",
      "The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, emerged as the strongest party across the country's formerly communist and less prosperous east. That cemented its primacy in a region that has long been its stronghold, and where it won its first state election last year.",
      "Other parties were stronger in only a few eastern constituencies outside Berlin. In western Germany, which accounts for most of the country's population, AfD trailed Merz's Union and sometimes other parties too but still polled strongly on its way to 20.8% of the nationwide vote, the highest postwar score for a far-right party.",
      "While AfD made the biggest gains, the Left Party made the most unexpected. The party appeared headed for electoral oblivion at the start of the campaign but pulled off a resounding comeback to take 8.8% of the vote.",
      "The Left Party appealed to young voters with very liberal positions on social and migration issues and a tax-the-rich policy, backed up by a savvy social media campaign.",
      "It benefited from polarization during the campaign after a motion that Merz put to parliament calling for many more migrants to be turned back at the border passed thanks to votes from AfD. Merz's conservatives have long refused to work with the Left Party, so there was no prospect of it putting him in the chancellery.",
      "Merz has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. He wrote on social network X Monday that \u201cmore than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.\u201d He added that \"for a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "Germany became Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier after the United States under Scholz. Merz has at times criticized the outgoing government for doing too little, notably calling for Germany to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv. Scholz refused to do that.",
      "Merz, like Scholz, has been tightlipped so far on whether Germany might contribute to a possible peacekeeping force, suggesting that the discussion is premature.",
      "Scholz pulled off a narrow come-from-behind victory in 2021 after presenting himself as the safest pair of hands available.",
      "But his government's agenda was quickly upended by the Ukraine war and the ensuing energy and inflation crises. His coalition became notorious over time for infighting and poor communication. Scholz has suggested recently that he maybe should have ended it sooner than he did.",
      "Scholz sought another unlikely comeback. But too many voters, and even some in his own party, had cooled on the unpopular chancellor."

      "A report says a fleet of Chinese fishing vessels used North Korean crews in violation of U.N. bans and many were apparently subjected to abuses including being trapped at sea for years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A fleet of Chinese fishing vessels used North Korean crews between 2019 and 2024 in violation of U.N. bans, and many people were apparently subjected to abuses including being trapped at sea for years, a report said Monday.",
      "The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-based group specializing in environmental and human rights issues, said it identified the presence of North Koreans on 12 Chinese tuna long-liners operating in the southwest Indian Ocean. The report was mostly based on interviews with 19 Indonesians and Filipinos who worked alongside them.",
      "\u201cThe testimony received from Indonesian and Filipino crew members suggests that concerted efforts were made to hide the presence of North Koreans on these vessels, and that those North Koreans on board were forced to work for as many as 10 years at sea \u2014 in some instances without ever stepping foot on land,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThis would constitute forced labor of a magnitude that surpasses much of that witnessed in a global fishing industry already replete with abuse,\u201d it added.",
      "The group said the North Koreans were passed from vessel to vessel to prevent them from returning to land. It cited unidentified Asian crew members as saying their North Korean shipmates were not allowed to use mobile phones or leave vessels during port visits.",
      "The group said it wasn\u2019t able to estimate the number of North Koreans aboard the Chinese vessels because of the transfers.",
      "The use of North Korean crew would be a breach of 2017 U.N. Security Council resolutions that required member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans and repatriate all remaining North Korean workers from their territories by the end of 2019.",

      "Interior Minister Moshe Arbel said French politician Hassan has \u201cconsistently worked to promote boycotts against Israel in addition to numerous public statements both on social media and in media interviews.\u201d",
      "Hassan, 32, who was born in Aleppo, Syria, and is a member of The Left group in the European Parliament, traveled by air to Israel with four other lawmakers as part of an EU-Palestine delegation, according to her office, which said it was unaware of the decision to bar her entry to Israel.

      "Friedrich Merz is on course to become post-World War II Germany\u2019s 10th chancellor, the culmination of a yearslong political career that was once sidelined by his party\u2019s iconic leader",
      "BERLIN -- Friedrich Merz, on course to become post-World War II Germany's 10th chancellor after the country's election, has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "Pulling a divided Europe together won't be easy when many leaders are too preoccupied by domestic issues to devote much energy to answers to the continent's most pressing problems. But expectations will be high for Merz to help fill a leadership vacuum and craft a united response to recent U.S. policy shifts that have strained the transatlantic alliance.",
      "\u201cAll the signals we are getting from the USA indicate that interest in Europe is clearly waning and that the willingness to get involved in Europe is decreasing,\" Merz told reporters at a press conference on Monday.",
      "\"Nevertheless, I hope that we can convince the Americans that it is in our mutual interest that we continue to have good trans-Atlantic relations.\u201d",
      "Merz's task will be complicated by the need to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He has repeatedly pledged not to work with the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party despite their second-place finish.",
      "The 69-year-old conservative leader heads the center-right Union bloc, which won Germany's national election with 28.5% of the votes.",
      "\u201cI am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us,\" he told supporters after his victory Sunday night. \u201cThe world out there isn\u2019t waiting for us, and it isn\u2019t waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations.\"",
      "The top job has been late in coming for Merz, a lawyer by profession, who saw his ascent derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in government.",
      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\u201cWe are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\u201d she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",
      "He practiced law and headed the supervisory board of investment manager BlackRock\u2019s German branch. During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.",
      "\u201cFriedrich Merz is perhaps the most international chancellor Germany has had since the war \u2014 if he becomes chancellor,\u201d said Volker Resing, who wrote the recently published biography \u201cFriedrich Merz: His Path to Power.\u201d",
      "Merz \u201crelies on personal initiative, on the freedom of the individual, on creativity and motivation. And only secondarily on the state,\" Resing said.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates more in Merkel's mold in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "Merz persisted and was elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz's \u201cway of doing politics\u201d is not to avoid confrontation at all costs. Instead, he maintains a perspective that \u201ca certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\u201d",
      "During the election campaign, Merz has vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Donald Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong transatlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "\u201cI have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\u201d he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure ... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\u201d",
      "Merz will be under pressure to help solve some of Europe\u2019s most urgent problems, according to Wolfgang Merkel, a political analyst from the WBZ Berlin Social Science Center, but \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t expect to hear one voice out of Brussels.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe interests are so different within the European Union, including the political majorities, that we shouldn\u2019t expect a resounding common EU policy,\u201d he said and added that it will likely \u201cbe the usual game of muddling through.\"",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz\u2019s tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Since then, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest against both Merz' motion and also the rise of the far right.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to \u201cnever\u201d work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany\u2019s parliament \u2014 an area where people are \u201crather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\u201d Resing said. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped him: rural life.\u201d",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",
      "He met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law. The couple has three adult children.",
      "Merz joined the CDU in 1972 and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He first joined the German parliament in 1994.",
      "A pilot openly passionate about his hobby, Merz sometimes flies his own small plane from his home in the Sauerland region in western Germany to Berlin early on Monday mornings.",
      "He has stuck to flying, despite the long hours imposed by his job as opposition leader and occasional criticism that he is indulging in a rich man's hobby.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk to him about flying, his eyes light up,\u201d Resing said. \"He says that when you\u2019re above the clouds, that\u2019s freedom.\u201d",

He was killed days after his cousin and predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Israeli airstrikes south of Beirut.",
      "Following Nasrallah\u2019s death on Sept. 27, Safieddine was secretly named Hezbollah\u2019s secretary-general but was killed just days later. The two men were buried at a secret location as they were both killed during the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war and their bodies exhumed for their funerals and reburial.",
      "Thousands of people marched behind Safieddine\u2019s coffin that was draped with Hezbollah\u2019s yellow flag in the southern village of Deir Qanoun An-Nahr while his black turban was placed on top.",
      "On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people attended the funeral of Nasrallah and Safieddine in Beirut in a show of strength by the Iran-backed group that suffered major losses during its war with Israel. Four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude twice during the funeral in Beirut on Sunday, once when the coffins were brought into the stadium, where the funeral was held, and a second time when Hezbollah\u2019s current leader Naim Kassem was giving a speech.",

      "Safieddine\u2019s brother, Abdallah, is Hezbollah\u2019s point man in Tehran, a crucial role in the organization given that Iran is its main backer, providing it with weapons and money.",
      "During the Israel-Hezbollah war that broke out a day after the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel killed some of Hezbollah\u2019s top political and military chiefs. The war, that left more than 4,000 dead in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, ended on Nov. 27 when a U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect.",
      "Last week, Israel withdrew its troops from much of south Lebanon but kept five posts inside the country in what the Lebanese government considers a violation of the ceasefire. As part of the deal, Hezbollah should now have an armed presence along the border with Israel."

      "The first phase of the ceasefire that paused 15 months of brutal warfare between Israel and Hamas militants is set to end on Saturday \u2014 and it's unclear what comes next.",
      "The two sides were supposed to start negotiating a second phase weeks ago in which Hamas would release all the remaining hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.",
      "But those negotiations have not begun \u2014 there have only been preparatory talks \u2014 and the first phase has been jolted by one dispute after another.",
      "Hamas has freed all 25 living hostages included in the first six-week phase ending on March 1 in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It has also released the bodies of four captives and is expected to turn over four more, though it's unclear if that will happen Thursday as planned.",
      "That leaves it with more than 60 captives, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has meanwhile delayed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be freed last weekend over the treatment of the captives, who were paraded before crowds.",
      "Israel is reportedly seeking an extension of the first phase to secure the freedom of more captives. But Hamas says it won't negotiate anything until the prisoners whose release was delayed are freed.",
      "Negotiations over Phase 2 will be even more contentious.",
      "The second phase was always going to be the most difficult because it would likely force Israel to choose between its two main war goals \u2014 the safe return of the hostages and the annihilation of their captors.",
      "Hamas, though weakened, remains in power with no internal challengers. In exchange for the remaining living hostages \u2014 its main bargaining chip \u2014 it is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. A third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction process, which is expected to take years and cost billions of dollars.",
      "Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, is returning to the region this week. In an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, he said he will aim for an extension of Phase 1 to buy time for negotiating the second phase.",
      "But Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, has refused to discuss an extension of Phase 1 until negotiations over Phase 2 begin, according to two Egyptian officials who were not authorized to brief reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "One official familiar with the negotiations said the mere launch of Phase 2 talks would keep the truce intact, according to the language of the deal. That would mean a continued halt in fighting and aid flowing into Gaza, though there would be no further hostage releases beyond what has already been negotiated, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed diplomatic contacts.",
      "Hamas has previously said it is open to a short extension to complete talks on Phase 2, but that was before Israel held up the release of the prisoners.",
      "One of the Egyptian officials said Egypt is also demanding Israel complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, before moving on to the next phase. The agreement calls for that withdrawal to begin this weekend and be completed within eight days.",
      "Netanyahu has not publicly stated what he will do this weekend. He is under heavy pressure from hard-line coalition partners to resume the war against Hamas. But after images showed freed hostages returning home in poor condition, he also faces heavy public pressure to bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "Witkoff said Netanyahu is committed to bringing back all the hostages but has set a \u201cred line\u201d that Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas has said it is willing to hand over control of Gaza to other Palestinians.",
      "But the militant group, which does not accept Israel's existence, would still be deeply entrenched in Gaza. And it says it won't lay down its arms unless Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war that Palestinians want for a future state.",
      "Hamas has also dismissed Israel's suggestion that its Gaza leadership go into exile.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire has yet to be completed and has only deepened the bitter mistrust on both sides.",
      "Israelis were shocked to see the captives \u2014 some of whom were emaciated \u2014 paraded before crowds upon their release, with some forced to smile, wave, deliver statements and, in one case, kiss a masked militant on the head. After returning to Israel, hostages said they were held under harsh conditions.",
      "Last Thursday, Hamas displayed coffins holding what it said were the remains of Shiri Bibas and her two small children, who it said were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel said a forensic investigation showed the two children were killed by their captors. The third body turned out to be someone else. Hamas then released another body that was confirmed to be the mother.",
      "On Saturday, Hamas filmed two hostages who were forced to watch the release of others, turning to a camera and begging to be released, in yet another public spectacle that infuriated Israel. That appears to have prompted Israel to postpone the release of the prisoners.",
      "Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire by killing dozens of people who the army said had approached its forces or entered unauthorized areas. It also accused Israel of dragging its feet on the entry of mobile homes and equipment for clearing rubble, which entered late last week, and of beating and abusing Palestinian prisoners prior to their release.",
      "Israel has also launched a major military operation in the occupied West Bank that has displaced some 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Israel says it is cracking down on militants who threaten its citizens, while Palestinians see it as trying to further cement its decades-long rule.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump took credit for the ceasefire, which Witkoff helped push across the finish line after a year of negotiations led by the Biden administration, Egypt and Qatar.",

Netanyahu welcomed the idea, which was universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, including close U.S. allies. Human rights groups said it could violate international law.",

      "Merz, who\u2019s promising to unite Europe in the face of challenges from both Russia and the United States, is expected to become the country\u2019s next leader. He'll likely partner with the center left Social Democrats, who suffered a stinging defeat after their coalition collapsed. But the results were seen a rebuke for mainstream parties as the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany notched its best results ever.",
      "The campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe\u2019s alliance with the United States.",
      "The results released by the electoral authority showed Merz\u2019s Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.",

      "For the time being, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democratic party suffered a stinging defeat, will stay on as head of a caretaker government.",
      "Merz\u2019s conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The three parties in the former governing coalition lost seats, with the SDP falling to 120 seats and the Greens to 85. The pro-business Free Democrats, which triggered early elections by pulling out of the coalition, failed to reach the 5% of the vote required to win seats.",

      "The AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country\u2019s main party in the next election as its appeal expands.

      "Still, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square, with many of the roughly 4,000 assembled understanding they may be in Rome for Francis' final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff\u2019s legacy.",
      "\u201cTo see him suffer hurts,\u201d said Robert Pietro, a Romanian seminarian who stood at the prayer holding a small, fragrant candle in tribute. \u201cBut we also pray in thanksgiving for what he has done for the Church.\u201d",
      "Roberto Allison, a priest from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said members of his community had come together to show appreciation for \u201call that we have learned from him.\u201d",
      "Stopping to deliver personal blessings to some at the end of the ceremony, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said the crowd's diversity \u2014 many world languages could be heard spoken \u2014 was \u201ca big sign of comfort\u201d for the Catholic Church.",
      "The Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has been hospitalized at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14 and doctors have said his condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and preexisting lung disease.",
      "But in Monday\u2019s update, they said he hadn\u2019t had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, and the supplemental oxygen he is using continued but with a slightly reduced oxygen flow and concentrations.",
      "A couple of Catholic tourists from Chicago, who arrived holding umbrellas well before the service started, said they prayed for the pope at daily Mass earlier at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and decided to come back. Like many, they found it \u201chard to process\u201d they may be in Rome for Francis\u2019 final days.",
      "\u201cNo one knows the day and time, but it\u2019s a historic moment nonetheless,\u201d said Edward Burjek.",
      "It felt the same for Hatzumi Villanueva of Peru. She was particularly fond of former pope St. John Paul II but said that Francis, as the first Latin American pope, \u201cdraws a bit closer.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe came to pray for the pope, that he may recover soon, for the great mission he's sharing with his message of peace,\u201d said Villanueva, who praised his empathy for migrants.",
      "Francis' papacy has also emphasized the defense of the environment and partial openness to LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Outside of the Vatican, Romans, pilgrims and even non-Catholics said they were offering special prayers for the hospitalized pope.",
      "\u201cWe are all sorry,\u201d said Raniero Mancinelli, who has tailored ceremonial clothing for Francis and the two previous popes in his shop just outside the Vatican\u2019s walls.",
      "Elisabetta Zumbo carried a 5-foot-long cross down a cordoned-off section of the street leading to St. Peter's as she prepared to lead a group of 34 pilgrims from the northern Italian city of Piacenza. With the rain pouring down, she pledged her group would pray intensely for the pope.",

      "Israel's military offensive, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, was among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. It pounded large areas of Gaza into rubble. The hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins.",
      "The ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended. If fighting resumes, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.",

      "Israel blames the destruction on Hamas because the militants positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in residential areas.",
      "Hamas has accused Israel of delaying the entry of mobile homes and tents in violation of the ceasefire. Israel denies the allegations and accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. Israel held up the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners last weekend to protest Hamas' practice of parading hostages before crowds in public spectacles during their release.",

      "The three-year milestone drew more than a dozen Western leaders to Kyiv for commemorative events in a conspicuous show of support.

      "The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research \u2014 a self-described conservative think tank \u2014 urges Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump.",

      "But the National Center for Public Policy Research's proposal has attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50,000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\u201d the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.",
      "The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.",
      "In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion \u2014 greater than any other business in the world.",
      "\u201cWe believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple\u2019s success as making the best products in the world,\u201d the company said in its statement against the proposal. \u201cWe seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed nearly that three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees at that juncture were men.",

The president and pro-crypto members of Congress have promised to usher in a golden age for the industry and pledged quick action to craft friendly regulations.

      "But after Assad  was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration, saying that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March.",
      "Eager to encourage the new leadership, the EU said it was suspending measures targeting oil, gas and electricity as well as transport, and notably the aviation sector. The possibility to fund and provide certain economic resources to five banks will be reinstated.",
      "Restrictions on the export of luxury goods to Syria for personal use will also be eased.",
      "The decision to lift the sanctions was taken by EU foreign ministers and was made as part of efforts \u201cto support an inclusive political transition in Syria, and its swift economic recovery, reconstruction, and stabilization,\u201d a statement said.",
      "The EU said that it would monitor developments in Syria to see whether other economic sanctions could be lifted, but it has also kept open the possibility of slapping the sanctions back on should the new leaders take the country in the wrong direction.",
      "In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria\u2019s interim president after a meeting of most of the country\u2019s former rebel factions. The groups agreed to dissolve the country\u2019s constitution, the former national army, security service and official political parties.",
      "International pressure has mounted for al-Sharaa to follow through on promises of an inclusive political transition. U.N. special envoy for Syria  Geir Pedersen has said the formation of a \u201cnew inclusive government\u201d by March 1 could help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted."

    "story": [
      "It wasn\u2019t too long ago that many colleges weren\u2019t even selling alcoholic beverages at sporting events on campus",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Missy Vraney and Kristin Westphal didn't go to Marquette. Neither did any of their relatives. Yet their family tradition of attending Golden Eagles basketball games spans generations.",
      "\u201cWhenever our uncle couldn\u2019t go, our dad would take one of us and just kind of alternate,\u201d Vraney recalls.",
      "They\u2019re still supporting the school regularly \u2014 just in beer money rather than tuition fees. It happens every time they buy a Marquette Golden Ale before heading to the Fiserv Forum stands.",
      "This marks the first season since Marquette entered a partnership with Milwaukee-based Third Space Brewing to sell Marquette Golden Ale \u2014 the school\u2019s officially licensed and co-branded craft beer \u2014 at Golden Eagles sporting events as well as in Third Space outlets and area groceries. As part of the deal, 15% of the revenues go back to Marquette.",
      "\u201cPeople are extremely excited about it,\u201d said Andy Gehl, the co-founder and president of Third Space Brewing. \u201cPeople love drinking beer with their favorite school, their favorite sports team\u2019s logo on it. That\u2019s No. 1. Also, they want to support businesses that support their university, and vice versa.\u201d",
      "This has become the latest fund-raising trend for college athletics.",
      "Learfield, which manages sports sponsorships for over 160 universities and licensing agreements for nearly 800 colleges, says that 93 of its schools had licensing deals for alcoholic beverages for the first six months of the current fiscal year. That\u2019s a 57.6% rise from fiscal year 2023, when 59 schools had deals for their own signature alcoholic beverage.",
      "The number of Learfield schools with licensing deals specifically with craft beers has more than doubled in that time \u2013 from 16 in 2023 to 36 this year.",
      "Cory Moss, Learfield\u2019s president of brand management and marketing, acknowledges he would have been surprised by this kind of growth four or five years ago. Then he started noticing more interest from the schools themselves and from various local craft breweries wanting to establish partnerships.",
      "\u201cWhen schools got really behind it and the craft industry really started to take it seriously, that\u2019s when it really started to grow,\u201d Moss said. \u201cAnd that growth hasn\u2019t been surprising.\u201d",
      "It represents a major change in the college sports landscape, considering how many schools weren\u2019t even selling alcoholic beverages at their athletic events not so long ago. The Southeastern Conference didn\u2019t permit the sales of beer and wine at sporting events until 2019.",
      "That policy change spurred Tennessee and other SEC programs to start getting local breweries to launch signature beers that could be sold at their games as well as in stores or tap rooms off campus. Tennessee partnered with Knoxville-based Yee-Haw Brewing Company last summer to make Vol Lager the exclusive craft beer of the Tennessee Volunteers.",
      "\u201cI think for the distributors and even the companies to get a return on their investment in terms of the sponsorship, being able to sell it within the venues is a big deal because when our fans can see it \u2014 100,000 people walking into Neyland Stadium \u2014 they might grow fan affinity to buy it at the grocery store also,\u201d said Alicia Longworth, Tennessee\u2019s deputy athletics director/chief marketing officer. \u201cWith the timing, it was good for the business and it was good for us.\u201d",
      "Longworth said Tennessee sold 16 different types of beer throughout Neyland Stadium last fall and Vol Lager always ranked in the top four.",
      "Gehl said over 3,000 \u201ccase equivalents\u201d (including cases of the canned beer or the equivalent of a case in draft beer) of Third Space Brewing were sold in the first three months since its partnership with Marquette began. Third Space is now selling sweatshirts with both the Third Space and Marquette logos as well as glasses that resemble the Marquette Golden Ale can.",
      "Other schools have enjoyed similar success with their signature beers. Learfield said college-licensed alcoholic beverages had $7.5 million in total sales during the 2024 fiscal year.",
      "Some universities with signature beers have proceeds go directly to the schools. Others have it go through collectives. For instance, Cincy Reigns \u2014 a collective benefiting Cincinnati athletics, established a partnership with Cincinnati brewery Rhinegeist to sell Cincy Light at Bearcats games and around the area.",
      "\u201cSome of the early feedback I received was there were bars and restaurants that said fans were showing up in gear just to drink Cincy Light at the bar,\u201d said Brian Fox, who chairs the Cincy Reigns board of directors. \u201cI think there was a TGI Friday's in one of the suburban areas, that said people were showing up \u2014 they weren\u2019t getting a table for dinner, they just knew they had Cincy Light on tap, so they showed up in fan gear, University of Cincinnati athletics gear just to try Cincy Light.\u201d",
      "Moss noted that these type of partnerships require plenty of input from both the school and the brewery, noting that you can\u2019t make a successful product just by slapping a school logo on a beer can.",
      "These schools generally try to find breweries with local ties. Yee-Haw, the company that partnered with Tennessee, was founded by Tennessee law school graduate Joe Baker. Third Space, which makes Marquette Golden Ale, has its brewery less than 1 \u00bd miles from Marquette\u2019s campus.",
      "But the most important factor in the success of these beers is obvious.",
      "Joe Dobrogowski of Germantown, Wisconsin, made that point clear as he enjoyed a Marquette Golden Ale before a recent game.",
      "\u201cIf it didn\u2019t taste good, I wouldn\u2019t force myself to drink,\u201d the Marquette season-ticket holder said. \u201cThat\u2019s first and foremost. I think it\u2019s just a bonus that some of it goes back to the school.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson will try against the odds to muscle a Republican budget blueprint to passage this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson will try against the odds to muscle a Republican budget blueprint to passage this week, a step toward delivering President Donald Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts over stiff opposition from Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans.",
      "With almost no votes to spare in Johnson's bare-bones GOP majority, the speaker is fighting on all fronts \u2014 against Democrats, uneasy rank-and-file Republicans and skeptical GOP senators \u2014 as he works to keep the package on track. Votes set for Tuesday evening are in jeopardy, and the outcome is uncertain.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get everyone there,\u201d Johnson, of Louisiana, said at an event at the start of the week, half-joking that he had a \u201cprayer request\u201d involved.",
      "The package, if approved, would be a crucial part of the budget process as Trump pushes the Republicans who control Congress to approve a massive bill that would extend tax breaks, which he secured during his first term but are expiring later this year, while also cutting spending across federal programs and services.",
      "But Republicans are running into a familiar problem: Slashing federal spending is typically easier said than done. With cuts to the Pentagon and other programs largely off limits, much of the other government outlays go for health care, food stamps, student loans and programs relied on by their constituents.",
      "It's all unfolding as billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk is tearing through federal agencies with his Department of Government Efficiency firing thousands of workers nationwide, and angry voters are starting to confront lawmakers at town hall meetings back home.",
      "\u201cWhile we fully support efforts to rein in wasteful spending and deliver on President Trump's agenda, it is imperative that we do not slash programs that support American communities across our nation,\u201d wrote Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and several other GOP lawmakers in the Congressional Hispanic Conference.",
      "Democrats in the House and the Senate are vowing to fight the whole process. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York was planning to gather lawmakers on the Capitol steps in protest during Tuesday\u2019s session.",
      "\u201cThis is not what people want,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during a rules debate ahead of planned votes.",
      "\u201cWe all know that trickle-down economics,\u201d he said about the 2017 tax breaks that flowed mainly to the wealthy, \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Trump has signaled a preference for the \u201cbig\u201d bill but also appears to enjoy a competition between the House and the Senate, lawmakers said, as he pits the Republicans against each other to see which version will emerge on a path toward approval.",
      "Senate Republicans, wary that Johnson can lift his bill over the finish line, launched their own scaled-back $340 billion package last week. It\u2019s focused on sending Trump money his administration needs for its deportation and border security agenda now, with plans to tackle the tax cuts separately later this year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m holding my breath. I\u2019m crossing my fingers,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who said he is rooting for the House's approach as the better option. \"I think a one-shot is their best opportunity.\u201d",
      "Johnson, whose party lost seats in last November\u2019s election, commands one of the thinnest majorities in modern history, which means he must keep almost every Republican in line or risk losing the vote.",
      "Already, several lawmakers have objected to the package either because it cuts too much or because it doesn't cut enough.",
      "The most conservative Republicans warn it will pile onto the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt load, because the cost of the tax breaks, at least $4.5 trillion over the decade, outweighs the $2 trillion in spending cuts to government programs.",
      "More moderate Republican lawmakers worry that the enormous budget cuts being eyed \u2014 some $880 billion to the committee that handles health care spending, including Medicaid, for example, or $230 billion to the agriculture committee that funds food stamps \u2014 will be too harmful to their constituents back home.",
      "GOP leaders are trying to convince lawmakers that the details will be debated in the weeks to come and that this week's vote is just a first step.",
      "The budget is being compiled during a lengthy process that first sends instructions to the various House and Senate committees, which will then have several weeks to devise more detailed plans for additional debate and votes.",
      "\u201cThe committees need time to go work to find savings,\" said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"But we can\u2019t even get to that if we don\u2019t get through the budget. So, we\u2019ve got to get the first step done later this week.\u201d",
      "Ten House GOP chairmen of the committees involved issued a joint statement in a show of force to push the package forward.",
      "\u201cThe House\u2019s \u2018one big beautiful bill\u2019 delivers on the entirety of President Trump\u2019s policy agenda,\u201d they wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cWe must meet this historic moment with the bold action it requires.\u201d",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters he recognizes the tension between Republicans who want more cuts and those from politically competitive districts who \u201chave a higher level of sensitivity to some of the spending reforms.\"",
      "Arrington said with economic growth assumptions, from 1.8% as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to 2.6% as projected by House Republicans, the package would generate about $2.6 trillion in savings over 10 years and would ensure the plan helps reduce the deficit.",
      "Some fiscal advocacy groups view the GOP\u2019s economic projections as overly optimistic.",

      "Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, carried a pistol and zip ties into the intensive care unit at UPMC Memorial Hospital in southern Pennsylvania's York County and took staff members hostage Saturday before he was killed in a shootout with police, officials said. The attack also left a doctor, nurse, custodian and two other officers wounded.",

      "\u201cNo one wants to be caught drinking Coke,\u201d said Mad Asaad, 21, a worker at the bakery-cafe chain Croissant House in the West Bank city of Ramallah, which stopped selling Coke after the war erupted. \u201cEveryone drinks Chat now. It\u2019s sending a message.\u201d",
      "Since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel's devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald\u2019s, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year.",
      "Here in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf \u2014 or pull them altogether.",
      "\u201cWhen people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,\u201d Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. \u201cI'm proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.\"",
      "With the \u201cbuy local\u201d movement burgeoning during the war, Chat Cola said its sales in the West Bank surged more than 40% last year, compared to 2023.",
      "While the companies said they had no available statistics on their command of the local market due to the difficulties of data collection in wartime, anecdotal evidence suggests Chat Cola is clawing at some of Coca-Cola\u2019s market share.",
      "\u201cChat used to be a specialty product, but from what we\u2019ve seen, it dominates the market,\u201d said Abdulqader Azeez Hassan, 25, the owner of a supermarket in Salfit that boasts fridges full of the fizzy drinks.",
      "But workers at Coca-Cola's franchise in the West Bank, the National Beverage Company, are all Palestinian, and a boycott affects them, too, said its general manager, Imad Hindi.",
      "He declined to elaborate on the business impact of the boycott, suggesting it can't be untangled from the effects of the West Bank's economic free-fall and intensified Israeli security controls that have multiplied shipping times and costs for Palestinian companies during the war.",
      "The Coca-Cola Company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Whether or not the movement brings lasting consequences, it does reflect an upsurge of political consciousness, said Salah Hussein, head of the Ramallah Chamber of Commerce.",
      "\u201cIt's the first time we've ever seen a boycott to this extent,\u201d Hussein said, noting how institutions like the prominent Birzeit University near Ramallah canceled their Coke orders. \u201cAfter Oct. 7, everything changed. And after Trump, everything will continue to change.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which he rephrased last week as a recommendation, has further inflamed anti-American sentiment around the region.",
      "With orders pouring in not only from Lebanon and Yemen but also the United States and Europe, the company has its sights set on the international market, said PR manager Ahmad Hammad.",
      "Hired to help Chat Cola cash in on combustible emotions created by the war, Hammad has rebranded what began in 2019 as a niche mom-and-pop operation.",
      "\u201cWe had to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d he said of the company's new \u201cPalestinian taste\u201d logo and national flag-hued merchandise.",
      "In its scramble to satisfy demand, Chat Cola is opening a second production site in neighboring Jordan. It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple.",
      "At the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer\u2019s sense of solidarity with the Palestinians.",
      "\u201cQuality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,\u201d said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. \u201cIf it\u2019s not good quality, the boycott won\u2019t stick.\"",
      "Chat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke\u2019s \u2014 just like its packaging. That's the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat's lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite.",
      "In 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke's designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn't violate copyright law.",
      "In the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded \u201cfamily size\u201d packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel's predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi's thorough inspection of the facility.",
      "Still, critics of the Palestinians-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, say that its main objective \u2014 to isolate Israel economically for its occupation of Palestinian lands \u2014 only exacerbates the conflict.",
      "\u201cBDS and similar actions drive communities apart, they don\u2019t help to bring people together,\u201d said Vlad Khaykin, the executive vice president of social impact and partnerships in North America for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. \u201cThe kind of rhetoric being embraced by the BDS movement to justify the boycott of Israel is really quite dangerous.\u201d",
      "While Chat Cola goes out of its way to avoid buying from Israel \u2014 sourcing ingredients and materials from France, Italy and Kuwait \u2014 it can't avoid the circumstances of Israeli occupation, in which Israel dominates the Palestinian economy, controls borders, imports and more.",
      "Deliveries of raw materials to Chat Cola\u2019s West Bank factory get hit with a 35% import tax \u2014 half of which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians. The general manager, Arar, said his company's success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor.",
      "For nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat's aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Among the local buyers left in the lurch was Croissant House in Ramallah, where, on a recent afternoon, at least one thirsty customer, confronting a nearly empty refrigerator, slipped to the supermarket next-door for a can of Coke.",
      "\u201cIt's very frustrating,\u201d said Asaad, the worker. \u201cWe want to be self-sufficient. But we're not.\u201d"

      "A Texas pipeline company has sued Greenpeace accusing the organization of defamation, disruptions and attacks during protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline",
      "MANDAN, N.D. -- A Texas pipeline company's lawsuit accusing Greenpeace of defamation, disruptions and attacks during protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline goes to trial in North Dakota on Monday, in a case the environmental advocacy organization says threatens free speech rights and its very future.",
      "The lawsuit stems from the protests in 2016 and 2017 over the oil pipeline's planned Missouri River crossing, upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long argued that the pipeline threatens its water supply. Of the thousands of people who protested the project, hundreds were arrested.",
      "Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access allege trespass, nuisance, defamation and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and its American branch, Greenpeace USA. The lawsuit also names the group's funding arm, Greenpeace Fund Inc.",
      "The jury trial in state court in Mandan, North Dakota, is scheduled to last five weeks.",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer alleges Greenpeace tried to delay construction of the pipeline, defamed the companies behind it, and coordinated trespassing, vandalism and violence by pipeline protesters. The lawsuit seeks millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The Dakota Access Pipeline was completed and has been transporting oil since June 2017.",
      "Greenpeace International said it shouldn't be named in the lawsuit because it is distinct from the two U.S.-based Greenpeace entities, operates outside the U.S., and its employees were never in North Dakota or involved with the protests.",
      "Greenpeace USA said the plaintiffs have failed to back up their claims in the years since the protests.",
      "Earlier in February, a judge denied motions by Greenpeace to throw out or limit parts of the case.",
      "Representatives of the environmental organization founded over 50 years ago said the company just wants to silence oil industry critics.",
      "\u201cThis trial is a critical test of the future of the First Amendment, both freedom of speech and peaceful protest, under the Trump administration and beyond,\u201d Greenpeace USA Interim Executive Director Sushma Raman told reporters. \u201cA bad ruling in this case could put our rights and freedoms in jeopardy for all of us, whether we are journalists, protesters or anyone who wants to engage in public debate.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace USA helped support \u201cnonviolent, direct-action training\u201d on safety and de-escalation at the protests, Senior Legal Adviser Deepa Padmanabha said.",
      "Energy Transfer is arguing that \u201canyone engaged in a training at a protest should be held responsible for the actions of every person at that protest,\u201d Padmanabha said. \u201cSo it's pretty easy to see how, if successful, this kind of tactic could have a serious chilling effect on anyone who might consider participating in a protest.\u201d",
      "Earlier in February, Greenpeace International filed an anti-intimidation suit in the District Court of Amsterdam against Energy Transfer, saying the company acted wrongfully and should pay costs and damages resulting from its \u201cmeritless\" litigation.",
      "An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the lawsuit is about Greenpeace not following the law.",
      "\u201cIt is not about free speech as they are trying to claim. We support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest. However, when it is not done in accordance with our laws, we have a legal system to deal with that,\u201d Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in a statement.",
      "The company filed a similar case in federal court in 2017, which a judge dismissed in 2019. Soon after, Energy Transfer filed the state court lawsuit now headed to trial.",
      "Energy Transfer launched in 1996 with 20 employees and 200 miles (320 kilometers) of natural gas pipelines. Today the 11,000-employee company owns and operates over 125,000 miles (200,000 kilometers) of pipelines and related facilities.",

      "Home Depot earned $3 billion, or $3.02 per share, for the three months ended Feb. 2. A year earlier it earned $2.8 billion, or $2.82 per share.",
      "Removing certain items, earnings were $3.13 per share. That\u2019s better than the $3.04 per share that Wall Street anticipated."

The NFIB said small business owners are feeling less confident about investing in their business due to uncertain business conditions in the coming months.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Thieves have targeted freight trains running through the deserts of California and Arizona in a string of audacious heists resulting in the theft of more than $2 million worth of new Nike sneakers, including many that haven't hit the retail market yet, according to officials and court documents.",
      "In a Jan. 13 robbery, suspects cut an air brake hose on a BNSF freight train traveling through a remote section of Arizona and made off with more than 1,900 pairs of unreleased Nikes worth more than $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. Many of the shoes were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which won\u2019t be available to the public until March 14 and are expected to retail at $225 per pair, the complaint states.",
      "It was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in remote areas of the Mojave Desert since last March that authorities are investigating, the Los Angeles Times reported. All but one resulted in the theft of Nike sneakers, according to investigators.",
      "Eleven people were charged in the Jan. 13 burglary with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. All 11 have pleaded not guilty and were all ordered detained until trial. Ten are Mexicans who were in the United States illegally. Another defendant is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum proceedings in the United States, authorities said in court records.",
      "The suspects in the Jan. 13 heist were caught with the help of tracking devices that were inside some of the boxes, the complaint says.",
      "In another case, a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry, Arizona, on Nov. 20 after it started losing air, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave County stopped a white panel van seen leaving the area and found about 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers valued at $41,400, the complaint states.",
      "Two other cases in which BNSF freight trains were burglarized near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona, last year resulted in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to federal criminal complaints.",
      "Thieves typically scout merchandise on rail lines that parallel Interstate 40 by boarding slow-moving trains, such as when they are changing tracks and opening containers, said Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona. Lewis told the Times that the thieves are sometimes tipped off to valuable shipments by associates working at warehouses or trucking companies.",
      "In another case, authorities say a Mexican man who controlled crews that burglarized trains had scouts who would tip him off on trains to target, supplied vehicles, paid crews and facilitated the sale of stolen merchandise.",
      "The suspects are often aided by accomplices in \u201cfollow vehicles,\u201d which track the rail cars. The loot is tossed off the train after it comes to a halt \u2014 either for a scheduled stop or because an air hose has been cut, according to Brynna Cooke, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.",
      "Thefts from cargo trains cost the nation\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100 million last year because of a combination of the value of the stolen goods and the cost of repairs to railcars the thieves damaged, and the problem is getting worse in recent years as the thefts have become more organized and sophisticated. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimates that the number of thefts jumped roughly 40% last year to 65,000 nationwide.",
      "In 2022, thieves raided cargo containers aboard trains nearing downtown Los Angeles for months, taking packages belonging to people across the U.S. and leaving the tracks blanketed with discarded boxes of items deemed not valuable enough to steal. The audacious thefts prompted authorities and freight companies to step up security in the area. In 2015, thieves stole 111 guns after busting the locks off a train in a Chicago railyard.",
      "Railroads have invested millions in measures to help prevent such thefts, but it\u2019s not like they can easily restrict access to the more than 140,000 miles of track they operate across the country. It crosses remote, rural areas and cuts through the heart of many cities carrying millions of shipments of everything from bulk commodities like coal and grain to raw materials like rock.",
      "The rail trade group said additional federal enforcement and tougher penalties are needed to deter the thefts. The railroads estimate that only about 1 out of every 10 theft attempts result in an arrest, and many of the people who are arrested are repeat offenders. One railroad even reported arresting the same individual five times in a single day.",
      "BNSF and the other major freight railroad that hauls goods across the western United States, Union Pacific, didn\u2019t immediately respond to inquiries from The Associated Press about the thefts. BNSF said in a statement to the Times that its internal police force shares information with local law enforcement and prosecutors as appropriate.",
      "The company said its crews are instructed not to confront thieves, but to report the incidents instead. But the crews rarely encounter them, it said, because the trains are so long and the thieves take care to evade detection.",
      "Cargo thefts from trains, trucks and ships are a problem in shipping hubs all across the country and a focus of the FBI. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15 billion and $35 billion in losses every year. Many of the more organized groups target major shipping hubs like Los Angeles, Dallas, Memphis, Chicago and Atlanta."

      "In 2011, the financier announced he would give away $1 billion to create jobs for the poor and asked the public to send him ideas. In came around 2,500 suggestions. Most were sob stories, but some people had good ideas, he says, and several suggested backing bachelor\u2019s degree nursing programs.",

So far, he has donated $325.6 million to support student aid, new buildings, efforts to recruit and retain faculty, and more at 22 nursing schools in the Eastern and mid-Atlantic regions. He also is backing a pediatric nursing program at Children\u2019s National Hospital, in Washington, D.C.",

      "America\u2019s nursing shortage is misunderstood, says Linda Aiken, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s nursing school. The public hears about a nursing shortage and thinks there are not enough nurses or people who want to become nurses, but the problem is more complicated than that, she says.",
      "While nurses are the largest group of health care professionals and the backbone of health care, their contributions are frequently undervalued by health care systems, and many are underpaid and experience a higher rate of burnout than other medical professionals, according to Aiken and other nursing experts.",
      "Many more people want to become nurses than there are spots available in nursing schools because there are not enough nursing professors. As a result, nursing schools can accept few of the students who apply.",
      "In 2022, roughly 78,000 qualified applicants were not accepted to U.S. nursing schools because of insufficient faculty, classrooms and lab space, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. There are also about 2,000 full-time nursing faculty vacancies at U.S. nursing schools, says Katie Fioravanti, director of the foundation arm of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.",
      "\u201cAttracting people to teach nursing is challenging because they can make considerably higher salaries in actual practice,\u201d Fioravanti says. \u201cBy the time they get a Ph.D. and go back to become a nursing faculty member or a dean, they\u2019re already in their 50s, and that means they retire sooner.\u201d",
      "The Conways didn\u2019t know much about nursing when they decided to donate to the field. With the help of a colleague whose wife was a nurse, the couple began learning about the profession and university nursing programs.",
      "They first gave money to support tuition at nursing schools, largely at the behest of Joanne Conway, a onetime scholarship student, and because her husband wanted to ensure students graduated without the burden of college debt.",
      "\u201cI wanted them to be free to be the kind of nurse they wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they wanted to work in an inner-city clinic and not make too much money or if they wanted to work someplace where they were going to make a lot of money, I wanted them to do what they wanted.\u201d",
      "Gradually, Conway supported building projects that expanded classroom and lab space, the hiring of additional faculty, and scholarships for nurses seeking advanced degrees to teach.",
      "His giving process has mostly stayed the same. When Conway is considering a first-time gift, he and the head of his Bedford Falls Foundation, Elizabeth Carrott Minnigh, visit nursing schools, meet with deans and ask for data related to graduation rates and nursing licenses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see if it\u2019s going to be a partnership where we could fund a reasonably large number of students who would actually get to the finish line without debt that will cripple them in their career choices and opportunities,\u201d Carrott Minnigh says.",
      "Conway and Carrott Minnigh then visit the schools regularly to talk to deans, faculty and students about any challenges they might be facing. These conversations have often translated into more targeted grants.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all grant-making process,\u201d Carrott Minnigh says. \u201cIt\u2019s all customized to what we hear at the schools about what they want and need.\u201d",
      "For example, in 2013, the Conways gave $4 million to Catholic University\u2019s nursing school. Since then, their giving to the institution \u2014 now named the Conway School of Nursing \u2014 has grown to more than $64 million, expanding full scholarships, largely paying for a new nursing school building and backing graduate nursing programs. The Conways also have supported mentoring efforts and a review course to prepare students for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses.",
      "\u201cCalling his donations transformational is not saying enough,\u201d says Marie Nolan, dean of Catholic\u2019s nursing school.",
      "Over the past decade, Conway has also significantly funded the University of Virginia\u2019s nursing school. In 2013, he gave $5 million for nursing scholarships and over time has donated nearly $50 million to expand scholarships for undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, support nurses who want to become professors, and help people pivot into nursing.",
      "UVA\u2019s nursing school\u2019s dean, Marianne Baernholdt, says Conway\u2019s extensive giving to nursing programs, and particularly his efforts to help nursing students early in their education, is rare among wealthy donors.",
      "\u201cThere are a couple of nursing schools that got big sums to increase their advanced practice nursing programs,\u201d Baernholdt says. \u201cBut very few invest in pre-licensure, which is what the Conways have done.\u201d",

      "The companies announced the all-cash offer, which values Just Eat Takeaway.com at 20.30 euros ($21.24) per share, on Monday. Prosus says the deal would create the fourth-largest food delivery group worldwide.",
      "Acquiring Just Eat Takeaway.com will particularly boost Prosus' food delivery portfolio in Europe. The tech investor, which is based in Amsterdam and majority-owned by South Africa\u2019s Naspers, has already tapped into this business both in and outside of the continent \u2014 including through its full ownership of Brazil-based platform iFood and a 28% stake in Germany's Delivery Hero.",

And recently, the company exited its U.S. operations by selling Grubhub to New York-based Wonder Group.

      "Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence boom to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Sales of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chip Blackwell will be top of mind when the company releases its latest financial results Wednesday, with analysts eyeing future demand amid a Chinese upstart's claim that it can train competitive AI models using far fewer resources.",
      "Wall Street expects Nvidia to report fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share on revenue of $38.08 billion, according to FactSet. The company\u2019s net income is expected to reach $19.58 billion.",
      "What happens with Nvidia matters for the entire U.S. stock market. The chip company has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street, which means the stock\u2019s movement carries more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than every company except Apple. The tech giant, based in Santa Clara, California, is now worth over $3 trillion.",
      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently, with the latest coming last week. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",
      "Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total return last year. None of the other 499 companies in the index came close. If Nvidia can\u2019t keep up its momentum, particularly when critics say its stock price has climbed too much and too quickly, Americans holding S&P 500 index funds in their 401(k) and other investing accounts could be set for pain.",
      "The fourth-quarter earnings will be the company\u2019s first report since Chinese company DeepSeek boasted it had developed a large language model that could compete with ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but was more cost-effective in its use of Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data.",
      "The frenzy over DeepSeek caused $595 billion in Nvidia\u2019s wealth to briefly vanish. But the company in a statement commended DeepSeek\u2019s work as \u201can excellent AI advancement\u201d that leveraged \u201cwidely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\u201d",
      "Nvidia had carved out an early lead in the AI applications race, partly because of founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia\u2019s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.",

They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline.",
      "It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from rich tax dodgers.",
      "The IRS has roughly 90,000 employees total across the United States, according to the latest IRS data. Racial minorities make up 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent 65%.",
      "In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.",
      "Representatives from the IRS and U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment from the AP."

      "A year from now, it might be a former Olympic sport.",
      "\u201cThat's a big concern \u2014 or a big issue \u2014 that we talk about,\u201d four-time Olympic champion Joergen Graabak of Norway said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Nordic combined is scheduled to wrap up competition at the Milan-Cortina Olympics on Feb. 19, 2026, and that may be its finale on the world stage.",
      "The International Olympic Committee will make the call in June, when it decides which events will be part of its program at the 2030 French Alps Winter Games.",

      "Nordic combined is the only Winter Olympic sport that excludes a gender, giving men an opportunity to go for gold while women are relegated to watching. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) plans to apply for women\u2019s Nordic Combined to become an Olympic sport, but not until the summer of 2026.",
      "The IOC is proud to say the 2026 Winter Games will be the most gender-balanced, hailing the fact that 47% of the athletes will be female.",
      "While the governing body could decide to give women a chance at Olympic gold in Nordic combined, it could also choose to eliminate the sport from the program in five years.",
      "FIS, national governing bodies, athletes, coaches and advocates are doing what they can to salvage the sport on the Olympic level. They have increased the number of participating skiers along with attempts to boost its visibility with a docuseries \u201cThe Overlooked,\u201d and a bigger presence on social media.",

      "Although the governing body in France is not going to call the shots, it is teaming up with FIS to publicly and privately push for women in Nordic combined to have their first opportunity to compete for Olympic gold in 2030.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s Nordic combined is developing little by little around the world and it\u2019s only logical that women should be able to join the Olympic program too,\u201d French skiing federation technical director Pierre Mignerey told the AP. \u201cBut we are not the decision-makers.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt's a very easy choice for them to make a quick fix, but I think for the future, it's best to keep it in the Winter Games.\u201d",
      "Three years ago, Nordic combined barely survived as an Olympic sport.",
      "The IOC\u2019s executive board lamented that it did not have strong international representation outside of Europe. During the previous three Winter Games, just four countries won the 27 medals available and the sport had the smallest audience during those Olympics.",
      "Since then, FIS has provided the IOC with progress reports every six months and met annually.",
      "Females who leave a perch as high as a 40-story building and fearlessly fly the length of an American football field and then race on cross-country skis have also done their part to keep flickering Olympic dreams alive.",
      "There are 46 women with World Cup points, entering world championships that start Thursday in Norway, after 30 females participated in the debut season four years ago.",
      "Skiers from Germany, Japan and Norway are in the top three in the World Cup standings and eight countries are represented among the top 12.",

      "The 20-year-old Brabec, though, is holding out hope she will get a shot to jump and ski for Olympic gold in France in five years.",
      "\u201cIt would be a real shame to keep us out,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI have heard the French really want us there. That's exciting and encouraging that there are people who do believe in the women in our sport.\u201d",

      "Ravindra took a blow on the forehead in a game 16 days ago and missed the last three one-day internationals, but recovered to strike 112 off 105 balls and carry New Zealand to 240-5 in 46.1 overs in reply to Bangladesh's 236-9.",
      "Bangladesh\u2019s middle order capitulated against the off-spin of Michael Bracewell, who took 4-26 in 10 overs. Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto led with 77. The 25 extras were the fourth highest tally in the innings.",

      "\u201cThe way we pulled things back with the ball was amazing. (It\u2019s) hard to take middle-overs wickets in ODIs and Bracewell was amazing. He\u2019s a quality bowler now, (and) the way he can change his pace on these wickets is outstanding.\u201d",
      "Fast bowlers Taskin Ahmed and Nahid Rana jolted New Zealand to 15-2 when Will Young, who made a century against Pakistan, went for a duck and Kane Williamson fell for rare consecutive single-digit scores in ODIs, 5 after 1.",
      "Taskin clean-bowled Young with a nip-backer into the right-hander and Williamson edged the tall Rana, whom New Zealand batters were facing for the first time in an international.",

      "Ludvig Aberg and Brian Campbell don't have much in common except winning on the PGA Tour",
      "One week the PGA Tour winner was Ludvig Aberg, a Swede so supremely talented that he played in a Ryder Cup before his first major, entered the top 10 in the world ranking just nine months after he left college and has been there ever since.",
      "The next week it was Brian Campbell, a 31-year-old who averaged $7,999 for the 186 tournaments he played over the last decade \u2014 one full year on the PGA Tour, the rest on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2014 before winning the Mexico Open. That was worth $1,260,000.",
      "Golf needs them both.",
      "Stars are what fuel interest. The PGA Tour gets a boost from these 72-man signature events with $20 million purses because they tend to deliver big names and often big moments. Scottie Scheffler has won four of them over the last two years. Rory McIlroy has won twice.",
      "There also has been some discussion over the last 25 years \u2014 dating to the World Golf Championships \u2014 that smaller fields make it easier to win no matter how stacked they are. But the signature events have not disappointed.",
      "Campbell, however, was a reminder that anyone can win on any given week. He had never won, not in his short time on the PGA Tour or what seemed like an eternity on the Korn Ferry Tour. That's one of the great charms about golf and always will be.",
      "His victory also showed those longshot moments still exist, even as the PGA Tour moves to reduce the number of full cards from 125 to 100 this year, and starts reducing the size of fields next year, including the elimination of some Monday qualifiers.",
      "Yes, the numbers are shrinking, but the opportunity is there.",
      "Meritocracy has not left the building.",
      "Campbell had a career season on the Korn Ferry Tour last year with three runner-up finishes to finish No. 8 on the points list and earn a ticket back to the big leagues. That gave him access to tournaments like the Mexico Open, where the final hour was no less compelling than when Aberg tracked down Maverick McNealy at Torrey Pines.",
      "An otherwise sleepy week at the Mexico Open \u2014 only two players from the top 30, four from the top 50 in the world \u2014 produced a duel over the final hour that was fun to watch considering what was at stake.",
      "There was Aldrich Potgieter, full of promise and power, a 20-year-old South African who won the British Amateur at the age of 17 and last year became the youngest Korn Ferry Tour winner. He's only getting started, and he simply smashes it off the tee.",
      "Potgieter led the field at Vidanta Vallarta by averaging 324.7 yards for all his measured drives, nine of them at 350 yards or longer.",
      "Campbell couldn't keep up with that \u2014 he was on average 39 yards shorter off the tee \u2014 and he didn't try. He spent the weekend alongside Potgieter and never flinched. He played with what he had, and it was enough.",
      "Both felt the nerves of trying to win their first PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cI thought I was going to throw up at multiple times during the day,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "\u201cPressure is a big thing. You can't really beat it, you just have to learn and adjust to it next time you're in this position,\u201d Potgieter said.",
      "The playoff was as fickle as golf gets. Potgieter twice pounded drives into the fairway on the par-5 18th holes, leaving him only a 6-iron to the green. Both times he could only manage par.",
      "Campbell pushed his drive so badly on the second playoff hole that it was sailing out-of-bounds until it crashed into the trees and caromed back into play. He was on hardpan, 94 yards behind Potgieter. He ripped a 3-wood back into position and hit lob wedge 3 1/2 feet from the hole.",
      "Potgieter missed his birdie putt from 6 feet. Campbell made his for the win, and the shock of it all didn't wear off for some time, especially after his girlfriend, Kelsi, just about tackled him on the 18th green and he swung her around in pure joy.",
      "\u201cI'm literally freaking out on the inside,\u201d Campbell told NBC when he regained his footing. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Here's what is going on. Campbell is headed to The Players Championship to compete for a $25 million purse. Then he has the Masters, and the PGA Championship. Along the way, he'll be in five of the $20 million signature events left on the PGA Tour schedule.",
      "Everyone expects Aberg or McIlroy or Scheffler or a dozen other stars to win. Not many knew anything about Campbell, who became a PGA Tour footnote as the last person assessed a penalty for slow play for two bad times in 2017 in New Orleans.",
      "(That was a weird one, the first year the Zurich Classic went to two-man teams. Campbell and teammate Miguel Angel Carballo each got a bad time, and because it was foursomes, they counted as one competitor).",
      "Now he's a PGA Tour winner, a feel-good story, just like Rafael Campos last year when he arrived in Bermuda two hours before his tee time because his wife had just given birth to their first child. In danger of losing his card, he won for the first time.",
      "They don't move the needle. That doesn't mean there's no room for them in this sport.",
      "The PGA Tour hopes to be stronger by rewarding the top performers and by reducing jobs and field sizes. That's harsh for those who don't make it, but they have no excuses as long as they have a tee time \u2014 whether that's in signature events, regular events or opposite-field events, or even if they have to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour or Q-school.",
      "No one ever wants to hear the solution is to play better, either because they have heard it for too long or they know it's true.",
      "A leaner tour \u2014 fewer cards, smaller fields \u2014 eliminates those who don't perform. That was Campbell in 2017 and for the next seven years in the minor leagues.",
      "And now he's going to the Masters.",

      "Wilhoite, 38, joined the Broncos' coaching staff in 2023 after previously working for head coach Sean Payton in New Orleans as a defensive and special teams assistant in 2019-20. He was the Los Angeles Chargers' linebackers coach from 2021-22.",
      "The Broncos set a franchise record last season with an NFL-best 63 sacks in the regular season as Denver ended an eight-year playoff drought.",
      "Before going into coaching, Wilhoite spent six seasons in the NFL as a linebacker with the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks.",

      "Manaea said Monday that had been dealing with the issue since getting to spring training.",
      "\u201cDidn't really get worse, it just kind of plateaued,\u201d Manaea said. \u201cThe worst part is it just never got any better over the last couple of weeks.\u201d",

      "Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said Manaea wouldn't throw again until he was free of symptoms, and he indicated that could take two to three weeks.",
      "\u201cThe good news is ... the tendon is not involved, the rib cage is not involved. So it\u2019s just straight muscle,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cHe's going to be shut down for a couple of weeks. So, and then we reassess after that, and we\u2019ve got to build him back up again. So, safe to say that he\u2019s probably going to start the season on the IL.\u201d",
      "Mendoza also told reporters at camp on Monday that infielder Nick Madrigal fractured his left (non-throwing) shoulder when he got hurt in a spring training game the previous day.",
      "The 27-year-old Madrigal, who is fighting for a roster spot, was playing shortstop Sunday when he charged a grounder up the middle and fired to first base before falling to the grass. An MRI revealed the extent of the injury, and he having more testing done Monday.",
      "With Manaea now sidelined, the Mets are without two of their expected starters. Frankie Montas is out because of a strained back.",
      "Montas, who signed a two-year, $34 million free-agent contract in December, was shut down last week for what the Mets said would be six to eight weeks. He is not expected back before May.",

      "His new, three-year contract came after he declined his player option for 2025, passing up the final $13.5 million of a $28 million, two-year deal he initially signed with the Mets. The 33-year-old was a free agent for the third consecutive offseason and had turned down a $21.05 million qualifying offer from the team.",
      "Manaea struck out 184 batters and walked 63 in a career-high 181 2/3 innings last year. He lowered his arm slot in midseason to emulate another nasty left-hander, NL Cy Young Award winner Chris Sale of the Atlanta Braves, and became New York\u2019s most effective starter down the stretch, with a 6-2 record and 3.09 ERA in his final 12 regular-season games.",

    "story": [
      "There are five former major leaguers serving as the top baseball executive for a big league franchise at the moment, forming one of MLB's most exclusive clubs",
      "PEORIA, Ariz. -- Shortly after his playing career ended, Jerry Dipoto took in a game at Wrigley Field with former big league manager Jim Fregosi. After a particularly nasty strikeout by Eric Gagne, Dipoto laughed.",
      "Fregosi promptly slapped Dipoto on the back of his head.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to remind you today. ... Don\u2019t ever forget how hard that it is to play,\u2019\u201d Dipoto recalled. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I think is the thing I remember most, and I think the benefit of the guys who have gone through it, is that they recognize that it is a really hard game.\u201d",
      "That lesson stayed with Dipoto as he made his way to his current job with the Seattle Mariners \u2014 and membership in an exclusive club. Dipoto is one of five former major leaguers serving as the top baseball executive for a big league franchise at the moment.",
      "Dipoto, 56, has been the president of baseball operations for Seattle since Sept. 1, 2021. Like Dipoto, Chris Young, 45, was promoted from general manager to president of baseball operations for the Texas Rangers on Sept. 13. Craig Breslow was hired as the chief baseball officer for the Boston Red Sox on Oct. 25, 2023, and Chris Getz was promoted to GM of the Chicago White Sox on Aug. 31, 2023.",
      "Buster Posey, 37, joined the list when the former All-Star catcher was hired as president of baseball operations for the San Francisco Giants in September.",
      "\u201cThere are a ton of incredibly successful executives who didn\u2019t play baseball,\u201d said Breslow, 44. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a prerequisite, but I do think it provides a level of credibility and empathy given I\u2019ve kind of been on every side of a transaction, or every side of a conversation I\u2019ve had to have with a player or coach. And credibility in terms of really being able to understand what players are thinking about, what they\u2019re going through.\u201d",
      "Under Breslow's leadership, Boston used a complicated contract structure to add Alex Bregman in free agency. Bregman also was being pursued by the Cubs and Tigers before he agreed to a $120 million, three-year deal with the Red Sox.",
      "San Francisco had been struggling to land a major free agent before shortstop Willy Adames agreed to a $182 million, seven-year contract with the Giants in December. Adames said Posey played a major role in his decision.",
      "\u201cMy meeting with the team, it was me and him, basically. No agent. Nobody,\u201d Adames said. \u201cSo we had a really, really good conversation, and I bought into his plan for this organization, for what he wants to build here in the near future.\u201d",
      "Breslow has a degree from Yale and Young graduated from Princeton, so the five players in charge of major league teams doesn't exactly represent some sort of counterrevolution when it comes to Ivy League grads in baseball.",
      "But today's major leaguers are increasingly savvy when it comes to the business side of the game, and they have firsthand experience with the data used by front offices as part of their decision-making process.",
      "\u201cWhere we were a decade ago to where we are now, there's just so much opportunity to make better decisions nowadays based on the information that we have,\u201d said Getz, 41. \u201cBut being well-versed in it now, you know having a former playing background is only going to position you, your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is just stronger.\u201d",
      "While that big league career is an asset in a variety of ways, it also creates a unique set of blind spots. Building out a front office that complements one another is key, Dipoto said.",
      "\u201cI learned to adapt along the way to things I didn\u2019t know and to trust people who are smarter than I am to fill in those gaps,\u201d he said, \u201cand to recognize when I\u2019m allowing my want to be a good teammate and my want to love the good teammate, sometimes, you have be able to discern when that doesn\u2019t equal best player fit for this situation.\u201d",
      "There are several more people in position to join the club one day. Brandon Gomes helped the Los Angeles Dodgers win the World Series last year, serving as the team's GM under Andrew Friedman. Ryan Garko was promoted to assistant GM with the Detroit Tigers in May. Cole Figueroa is an assistant GM for the Rangers.",
      "Kevin Reese and Tim Naehring work for longtime New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, and Josh Barfield is part of Getz's front office with the White Sox.",
      "When it comes to his discussions with players interested in working in baseball operations, Breslow said the conversations provide an indication of the potential for success.",
      "\u201cIt becomes pretty clear, generally who has the curiosity, who asks a lot of questions,\u201d he said. \"Who wants to learn why we make decisions not just what decisions are being made. Those are the people (that could make the transition).\u201d",

      "The 76ers are a team in trouble",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Yes, the Philadelphia 76ers played without two-time NBA scoring champion and the always-injured Joel Embiid. Yes, they haven't been a playoff contender this season, even with two other All-Stars in the starting lineup.",
      "Yet, there it was, on the scoreboard, on all the social media derision, on the top of the implausibility-meter when the 76ers broke camp for the Bahamas.",
      "That was no misprint on the ticker in the fourth quarter: Bulls 136, 76ers 86.",
      "Down 50!",
      "Did the Sixers quit? Do the Sixers realize \u2014 with or without whatever Embiid and his balky left knee can give them \u2014 their season is over?",
      "\u201cI don't want to believe that,\u201d nine-time All-Star Paul George said. \u201cI don't sense that in the locker room and I don't believe that.\u201d",
      "George has little choice publicly but to stand by the Sixers, even as they lost their eighth straight game and 10th of 11 overall \u2014 142-110 on Monday nigh t to the 23-win Chicago Bulls \u2014 and see even the odds of a play-in tournament berth dip to the point where fans are already looking at next season.",
      "Not that it promises anything better than the mess that's unraveled in South Philly this year.",
      "\u201cI'm not quite sure what fell apart to give up 140 points, at home, against the Chicago Bulls,\u201d George said.",
      "The real bad news \u2014 you know, before six Bulls scored at least 15 points \u2014 came hours ahead of this debacle when the Sixers offered no real update on Embiid. Embiid missed his 38th game of the season for the sagging Sixers, and all options \u2014 from rest to potential surgery to playing through pain \u2014 remain on the table, depending on the results of continued testing and imaging.",
      "Embiid has played in just 19 of 57 games for the Sixers, who fell to 20-37 an have only a faint shot at earning a berth in the NBA play-in tournament. Embiid has averaged 23.8 points \u2014 he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons \u2014 and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody envisioned it going like this,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing on a lot of levels. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version is of with him playing. It hasn\u2019t worked out like that. Yet.\u201d",
      "The 76ers are a franchise in turmoil and suffering through an internal tug-of-war when it comes to Embiid. Can he play through the pain and should he, even with the woeful record? Why not just shut him down and try again next year?",
      "Even George \u2014 who left the Los Angeles Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract \u2014 conceded the juice might not be worth the squeeze when it comes to a potential Embiid return. The 76ers are one of the worst teams in the league and are trending closer to Toronto, Charlotte, Washington and a lottery pick than making a serious run in the postseason.",
      "Maybe sitting Embiid is for the best \u2014 just as it was seemingly was early in the Process.",
      "The 76ers\u2019 first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps one more reason the Sixers could shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.",
      "\u201cWe're showing no signs of a team that will compete,\u201d George said. \u201cWe just don't have the habits of a championship or a playoff-contending team would have. To be honest, right now, it's a little farfetched. All we can do is work hard. Try to just keep going for one another. We've shown no signs of, forget championship, but a playoff contending-team here.\u201d",
      "Does Nurse survive and earn a third season on the bench?",
      "What about team president Daryl Morey, who built this mishmashed roster full of patchwork free-agents and needlessly gave Embiid a three-year, $193 million contract extension ahead of training camp.",
      "Just as former Eagles running back Ricky Watters once said: For who? For what?",
      "\u201cWe've got to be more dialed in. More effort. More energy,\" George said. \"More pride on the defensive end. Again, same conversations we've been having. Low communication. It baffles me just how easy we give up layups in this league. I don't understand.\u201d",
      "Join the club.",
      "So where is the next win on the schedule? Wednesday night against a Knicks team winning at a 65% clip at Madison Square Garden? Against Steph Curry and the Warriors?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a vision, but we have a lot of games left,\u201d 2024 All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said.",
      "Not really. Certainly not enough to make anyone who watched a 1-9 February \u2014 and has four of 20 wins against Charlotte \u2014 believe the season can be saved. The 76ers are only 7-8 this season when Embiid, George and Maxey start together.",
      "\u201cEverybody needs to look at themselves, at what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional,\u201d Nurse said.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The hopes of many NFL teams will start taking shape this week as the league's annual scouting combine begins in Indianapolis.",
      "As usual, there will be plenty to debate.",
      "There doesn't appear to be a clear-cut No. 1 overall pick or a top quarterback yet. Scouts are still trying to determine whether Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter would be more productive as a shutdown cornerback, a playmaking receiver or both.",
      "But the combine gives each team more insight into how the 329 prospects will be evaluated heading into the draft that will be held from April 24-26 in Green Bay.",
      "Here's a look at what could lead the discussions between players arriving in town Tuesday and the conclusion of workouts Monday.",
      "Hunter could be the most intriguing draft prospect in combine history because of his versatility. Some consider him both the draft's best cornerback and best receiver.",
      "While he's scheduled to work out Friday with defensive backs, organizers invited him to spend an extra night and work out Saturday with the receivers, making him the first true two-way player in combine history.",
      "Could he follow the lead of other top prospects and skip the on-field drills? Sure. Or he might choose to create the biggest buzz of the week by working out at both spots. The first indication could come Thursday when he's expected to meet with reporters.",
      "The two former Pac-12 rivals will share the big stage again this week \u2014 even if neither actually participates in Saturday's on-field drills as they try to be the first quarterback selected in April.",
      "They took very different journeys to Indy.",
      "Ward had one scholarship offer coming out of high school and parlayed a successful career at FCS school Incarnate Word into a starting job at Washington State. He even declared for last year's draft before re-entering the transfer portal and landing at Miami, where his decision paid off handsomely.",
      "Ward broke the NCAA's career record with 158 TD passes split between his FCS and FBS stints, led Miami to the cusp of a playoff berth and wound up a Heisman finalist.",
      "Sanders, the son of Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders seemed primed to be in this mix for years. He's accurate, mobile, possesses a strong arm and is outgoing.",
      "He's also outspoken though scouts may have bigger concerns about the influence Sanders' father could play in his pro career, and he's not expected to work out until Colorado's pro day next month.",
      "The former Georgia star could be the top edge rusher in this year's draft class, perhaps supplanting Penn State rusher Abdul Carter, should everything fall into place.",
      "First, though, Walker must answer questions about where he fits best into an NFL defense.",
      "His productivity and overall skills are unquestioned. But in college, he was listed at 6-foot-2, 245 pounds, making some wonder whether he's a better pass rusher or a better traditional linebacker. This week's numbers could help settle a debate that could linger into draft day.",
      "Jeanty looks like a virtual lock to be the top running back chosen after producing the second-highest single-season rushing total in FBS history. He has the combination of power and breakaway speed teams typically covet.",
      "The question is how high will he go?",
      "Many teams have opted to wait for running backs to slide, and they undervalued the position in free agency, too. But last year's big free agent acquisitions \u2014 Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs \u2014 all had big seasons and it could change this year's decisions.",
      "Johnson didn't have the final college season he envisioned after winning a national championship primarily because a bruised shoulder and a turf toe limited him to eight games.",
      "When healthy, Johnson is among the best at his position.",
      "Teams will likely spend extra time making sure he's ready to start on time. If so, Johnson should be a top-15 pick and could move into the top 10 with a good time in the 40.",

    "summary": "No. 13 N",
    "story": [
      "No. 13 N",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Sonia Citron was down to the final frantic seconds, her top-ranked Notre Dame team down three and on the verge of its first loss since November. There was just enough time to launch a contested 3-pointer over N.C. State's Aziaha James.",
      "The ball dropped cleanly through, sending Citron's jubilant teammates to mob her while leaving James walking in fists-clenched disbelief.",
      "Yet James later had her own highlight-reel response, a transition layup in which she smoothly took the ball around her back to change hands and avoid a strip attempt by Olivia Miles during the 13th-ranked Wolfpack's clinching run in the second overtime.",
      "Big shots. High-level guard play. A packed house and a national spotlight beyond. The Wolfpack's 104-95 victory in the double-OT classic Sunday had it all in what turned out to be the latest showcase moment for the sport, down to former NBA great Magic Johnson weighing in on social media in real time about a game that seemingly didn't want to end.",
      "\u201cThat means there's more eyes on our game,\u201d Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey said, referencing ESPN's \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d show being at Reynolds Coliseum.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the viewership was where it needed to be. ... We were just excited to have the opportunity to play, No. 1. But again, just bringing a lot of attention to the women's game, to the ACC, is always something that's a positive.\u201d",
      "The late-season stakes were already compelling enough for the game. The top-ranked Fighting Irish (24-3, 15-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) had won 19 straight games to reach No. 1 for the first time under Ivey, and a win would allow them to clinch the league's regular-season title outright.",
      "Then there was N.C. State (22-5, 14-2), aiming to keep alive its chances of at least sharing that regular-season title while also chasing its first win against a No. 1-ranked team at home since 1978.",
      "The buzz had already built coming into Sunday. Wolfpack fans had lined up hours before doors opened at the venerable campus arena. Seven WNBA teams had scouts on hand for a game featuring Notre Dame's backcourt of Hannah Hidalgo and Olivia Miles battling the N.C. State backcourt featuring Saniya Rivers \u2014 a versatile guard with length \u2014 and a gifted, explosive scorer in James.",
      "The Irish and Wolfpack went on to provide a captivating show, a reminder that there\u2019s talented players and teams eager to take the baton from last year\u2019s stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese that had been at the forefront of the sport\u2019s rapid rise in popularity.",
      "Beyond Rivers and James (20 points), N.C. State\u2019s Zoe Brooks went for a career-high 33 points while repeatedly challenging Hidalgo (26 points). And as the game wore on on its way through 21 ties and 21 lead changes, it began to feel bigger than merely a single game on the league's regular-season schedule.",
      "By the end, Wolfpack players were mobbing each other on the court to celebrate a draining-but-thrilling win. And it wasn't long before they took that party to the campus Memorial Belltower to celebrate with fans \u2014 the site where N.C. State marked the unexpected double Final Four by its men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams last spring.",
      "\u201cStarting from this morning, I was honestly getting really emotional this morning when I found out that the students were camping out at like 10 p.m. last night,\u201d said Rivers, who came within an assist of a triple-double. \u201cYou think back and it's just like: people usually don't even like women's basketball. But it's just evolving ever since a year or two ago, and everybody is starting to get more involved.\u201d",
      "Wolfpack coach Wes Moore said the team had come by to pass out doughnuts to fans waiting in line beforehand.",
      "\u201cI mean, it was a lot of fun,\u201d Moore said. \"That's what I told our players: \u2018You worked hard to put yourself in this position. Now enjoy it.\u2019 ... And it was everything you could hope.\u201d",
      "And that included getting a couple of big-time shots, too.",
      "The first came from Citron, who had 21 of her 23 points after halftime along with that OT-forcing 3 that had Johnson to excitedly posting on X: \u201cWow wow wow.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt actually didn't work out exactly as planned, but I knew the ball in my hand and i had to shoot it,\u201d Citron said, adding that she \u201cwasn't open how I was supposed to be.\u201d",
      "It didn't matter, just like Miles' running-back attempt to stop James' jaw-dropping score in the second OT.",
      "Sporting a bandage over her right eyebrow from earlier in the game, James smoothly took the ball around her body, handing it from her left hand to her right as Miles ran by, and then back to her left for the finish without breaking stride.",
      "The layup sent Wolfpack fans into a shocked roar. Johnson was just as impressed, calling it \u201cunbelievable\u201d in his post on X.",
      "\u201cThis has been the best women's college basketball game this season!\u201d he added.",
      "It was hard to argue otherwise.",

      "Emily Harrop of France and Spain's Oriol Cardona Coll won World Cup ski mountaineering races that served as a test event for next year's Olympics",
      "BORMIO, Italy -- Emily Harrop wasn\u2019t fast enough going downhill on skis to get near the podium in Alpine skiing.",
      "But she\u2019s proving tough to beat going uphill.",
      "The French athlete has earned the moniker \u201cqueen of ski mountaineering\u201d after making the switch at the age of 20 and will be the favorite to win gold when the sport makes its Olympic debut at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Games.",
      "Harrop has won all four World Cup sprint races this season, the last of which came Saturday at an Olympic test event in Bormio, the venue for next year\u2019s ski mountaineering \u2014 or skimo \u2014 events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to come here a year before to test it out, it was really exciting for all of us,\u201d Harrop said after her victory. \u201cI think everyone had in their minds this year the test event, so I\u2019m really glad to have gotten to the end of this day with a big confidence boost with this win.\u201d",
      "Harrop, who grew up in France to English parents, followed her win up with a second-place finish in Sunday\u2019s mixed relay, alongside Thibault Anselmet.",
      "The 27-year-old Harrop is a four-time world champion in relay and team events and has also won the overall and sprint World Cup titles in each of the past three seasons.",
      "Ski mountaineering makes athletes first go up the mountain, before coming back down.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you combine cross-country skiing with Alpine skiing. You kind of sprint up a mountain with your skis on, and then ski down a mini Alpine course,\u201d said Cameron Smith of the United States.",
      "In sprint races, the ascent is mostly made on specialized skis covered with so-called climbing skins \u2014 which improve traction against the snow \u2014 and partly made on foot in ski boots. Once the competitors reach the top of the course, they switch to downhill skiing to descend down the mountain again.",
      "At the Olympics, 18 male and 18 female athletes will compete in individual sprint races and a mixed relay.",
      "A sprint race normally only lasts about three minutes \u2014 a much shorter version of other ski mountaineering events such as vertical (uphill only) and individual races, which can last well over an hour but are not part of the Olympic program.",
      "That means athletes have had to change their training routine to focus more on the action-packed Olympic formats.",
      "\u201cMy training changed a lot because the races are short and we are doing a lot of gym, a lot of short intervals,\" said Oriol Cardona Coll of Spain, who won the men\u2019s sprint as well as the mixed relay with Ana Alonso Rodriguez. \"We changed a lot the preparation and it worked.\u201d",
      "The course in Bormio will be at the foot of the iconic Stelvio slope, which will also host the men\u2019s Alpine skiing events.",
      "And, as one athlete summed it up, the setup involves a bit of everything: an ascent on skins from the start, followed by steps climbed on foot while carrying skis on the back, then another short ascent before taking off the skins and skiing 70 meters downhill, through raised banks and steep curves.",
      "The mixed relay differs slightly in that there is another descent halfway through the longer course, which is raced twice \u2014 in alternating order \u2014 by each member of the team.",
      "While the races are fast, the transitions where athletes have to take their skis or skins on and off means they have to be mentally focused as well as physically prepared.",
      "\u201cI tell people we just practice taking our skis on and off a lot,\u201d said American Jessie Young, who finished 10th in the relay together with Smith.",
      "While the sprint is explosive and fun to watch, there are some that say it is not true ski mountaineering.",
      "\u201cI think the sprint is a really fun, really fast, spectator friendly event. It\u2019s very different, it\u2019s almost a different sport than some of the long ones,\u201d U.S. racer David Sinclair said.",
      "Many athletes in Bormio agreed that it differs greatly from the sport\u2019s traditional epic Alpine climbing, but they feel it will serve as a good introduction to ski mountaineering.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like saying the 100 meters isn\u2019t a real race. It\u2019s true that when someone goes out running, they don\u2019t only do 100 meters normally, but I think it\u2019s the most followed event in the Summer Olympics,\u201d Italy\u2019s Nicol\u00f2 Ernesto Canclini said. \u201cThen there had to be this compromise for skimo to get into the Olympics. \u2026 Hopefully in the future there will be the more classic races too.\"",
      "When asked whether he prefers the sprint or the longer races, Canclini said: \u201cMy favorite is when I\u2019m without a race number and I just go up into the mountains and stop at a rifugio (mountain lodge) for a nice beer, that\u2019s the best ski mountaineering for me.\u201d",
      "For Canclini, next year\u2019s Olympics will be even more special as the races will be held on home snow.",
      "Canclini, a two-time world champion, grew up in Bormio and lives about 300 meters from the slope.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great emotion to be racing at home,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a youngster I was an Alpine skier, so having seen all the greats race here on this slope, I dreamed of also racing here. Then I changed sport, and in the end I still got to race here.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a great satisfaction and feeling.\u201d",
      "Canclini\u2019s grandparents, parents and other family and friends were at the bottom the slope to cheer him on at the weekend.",
      "Unfortunately, Canclini tripped during his ascent on foot in the qualifiers, losing about three seconds at the top as his skis became trapped in the strap holding them to his back. He failed to make it to the quarterfinals by less than a second.",
      "\u201cEveryone said to me, \u2018better that it happened this year than next\u2019,\u201d Canclini said with a laugh. \u201cBut it would have been even better if it hadn\u2019t happened at all.\u201d",

      "Officials say a first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea",
      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

      "The first phase spans 47,000 square meters (506,000 square feet), roughly the size of about five baseball fields. When completed, it will be 294,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet).",
      "Built on the grounds of a shuttered Toyota Motor Corp. auto plant, it\u2019s meant to be a place where researchers and startups come together to share ideas, according to Toyoda.",
      "Ambitious plans for futuristic cities have sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet in Toronto; \u201cNeom\u201d in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi\u2019s airport.",
      "Woven City\u2019s construction began in 2021. All the buildings are connected by underground passageways, where autonomous vehicles will scuttle around collecting garbage and making deliveries.",

      "Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding posted its fastest revenue growth in over a year, beating analyst expectations as it capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom in China",
      "HONG KONG -- Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding posted its fastest revenue growth in more than a year, beating analyst expectations as it capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom in China.",
      "Alibaba said Thursday that its revenue for the quarter ended December grew 8% to 280.2 billion yuan ($38.38 billion) compared to the same period last year.",
      "Net income surged to 48.9 billion yuan ($6.71 billion). Alibaba\u2019s New York-traded stock was up over 12% following the earnings results.",
      "In an earnings call, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said that Alibaba plans to \u201caggressively invest\u201d in artificial intelligence and cloud computing infrastructure in the coming three years, with upcoming spending expected to exceed what the firm has already invested over the past decade.",
      "\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrated substantial progress in our \u2018user first, AI-driven\u2019 strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses,\u201d Wu said.",
      "He said that Alibaba\u2019s artificial intelligence strategy was to pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is artificial intelligence that can match or surpass human intelligence and can self-teach.",
      "He added that such an opportunity for industry transformation is something that comes along \u201conce every several decades\u201d and said that AGI was Alibaba\u2019s primary goal.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s plan to go big on artificial intelligence comes as rivalry in the AI space heats up between U.S. and China. Chinese AI firm DeepSeek recently rattled the U.S. AI industry after its AI model appeared to rival those of leading U.S. companies while being trained on cheaper hardware.",
      "The Hangzhou-headquartered firm is one of many technology firms in China who are racing to get ahead in the AI space. In January, it unveiled its latest Qwen AI models that have performed well in benchmark tests, placing Alibaba among the leading companies in China\u2019s AI industry.",
      "Alibaba is working with Apple to incorporate its AI technology into Chinese iPhones, the firm said earlier this month.",
      "Alibaba has already implemented AI technology into its cloud products, with its cloud business unit generating 13% revenue growth compared to the same time last year \u2013 the fastest pace in about two years.",
      "Its international commerce unit, which includes platforms such as AliExpress and Lazada, saw revenue growth of 32% driven by \u201cstrong performance of cross-border businesses.\u201d",
      "Alibaba was one of several prominent Chinese technology companies which suffered the brunt of a regulatory crackdown on the technology industry in 2020, when authorities scuppered the initial public offering of its financial affiliate Ant Group.",
      "The company was later fined a record $2.8 billion for violating anti-monopoly laws. Jack Ma, one of Alibaba\u2019s cofounders, disappeared from public view and the company\u2019s stock price slumped for several years.",
      "But Beijing appears to have shifted gears towards the technology industry as it pursues technology supremacy and self-sufficiency amid deteriorating U.S.-China relations.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping recently held a private symposium, meeting with prominent entrepreneurs including Ma.",
      "The meeting, coupled with DeepSeek\u2019s AI advancements, were among the factors that sparked renewed interest in the Chinese technology industry, sending technology stocks soaring in recent weeks.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s stock price is up more than 60% this year. Its U.S.-listed shares rose 8.5% in morning trading, to $136.58."

      "Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.",
      "The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.",
      "Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.",
      "All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.",
      "Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.",
      "The delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\" \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.",
      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",
      "Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers who were involved in the government's response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years.",
      "The workers were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on the recommendations of billionaire Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency, which is working to carry out Trump\u2019s promise to streamline and reshape the federal government.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon said the administration should be more careful in how it carries out the cuts.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump is fulfilling his promise to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse in government, DOGE needs to measure twice and cut once. Downsizing decisions must be narrowly tailored to preserve critical missions,\u201d said Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska.",
      "The bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus since the outbreak began in 2022. Most of the birds killed were egg-laying chickens, so that has driven egg prices up to a record high of $4.95 per dozen on average. The federal government has spent nearly $2 billion on the response, including nearly $1.2 billion in payments to farmers to compensate them for their lost birds.",
      "A USDA spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\u201d and several key jobs like veterinarians, animal health technicians and other emergency response personnel involved in the effort were protected from the cuts. But some employees of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were eliminated.",
      "\u201cAlthough several APHIS positions supporting HPAI were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\u201d the department spokesperson said.",
      "Politico and NBC News reported that the jobs that were eliminated were part of an office that helps oversee the national network of labs USDA relies on to confirm cases of bird flu and other animal diseases. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.",
      "\u201cAt a time when producers are already grappling with the bird flu, the public is facing high prices, and all Americans are on edge about what broader spread of this virus could mean, the last thing the administration should have done was to eliminate these positions,\" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. \"USDA must rehire these crucial personnel immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said this week that the USDA might change its approach to the bird flu outbreak, so that maybe entire flocks wouldn't have to be slaughtered when the disease is found, but they have yet to offer many details of their plan.",

    "summary": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

    "summary": "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:21:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world&rsquo;s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
    "story": [
      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene on Wednesday near Arthur River on Tasmania\u2019s northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\u201d Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), while the adults weighed 3 metric tons (3.3 U.S. tons).",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River local resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to attempt to refloat them.",
      "\u201cThe water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They\u2019re just dying, they\u2019ve sunk down in the sand,\u201d Flint said Wednesday morning. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late.\u201d",

      "During their joint Oval Office appearance on Monday, Macron interrupted Trump when the latter said that Europe was being paid back 60% of the aid it contributed to Kyiv over the last three years of war.",
      "Touching Trump's arm to interject, Macron said, \"No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort: it was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantees, grants,\" Macron said. \"And we provided real money, to be clear.\"",
      "After Macron's comments, Trump smiled and replied, \"If you believe that, it's okay with me.\"",

    "summary": "The first month of President Donald Trump's second term has already delivered a radical American pivot on Russia's offensive war against Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine now finds itself under pressure from both Russia and the U.S.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his leadership team spent much of 2024 cautiously courting both sides of America's widening political divide -- well aware that repelling Russia's ongoing invasion relied, in large part, on U.S. largesse.",
      "Kyiv appeared hopeful it could weather President Donald Trump's dramatic return to the White House, assuring itself and the world that his campaign trail alignment with Russia's narrative would be tempered by the geopolitical realities of the world's most powerful office.",
      "But the first month of Trump's second term has already delivered a radical American pivot. The opening of U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia -- intended to secure peace in Ukraine, but conducted without Kyiv's involvement -- and subsequent fraying of U.S.-Ukrainian ties, poses a new crisis for a nation that has grown used to living with existential peril.",
      "Volodymyr Fesenko, a political scientist and the \u0421EO of the Center for Political Studies \"Penta\" in Kyiv, told ABC News that recent developments represent \"the most acute crisis in relations between the U.S. and Ukraine in their entire history.\"",
      "\"In the worst case, this is a strategic turn of the U.S. towards Russia, rapprochement with Putin and weakening -- or even the destruction -- of previous partnership relations with Europe and Ukraine,\" Fesenko said. \"I am afraid that this is the scenario that will gradually be realized.\"",
      "\"With Trump's businesslike approach to bilateral relations, and with his interest in restoring relations with Russia, the previous special partnership relations between the U.S. and Ukraine will no longer exist,\" Fesenko said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's commitment to involving Kyiv in any talks to end the war was embodied by the \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\" motto. That approach appears to have been replaced with Trumpian transactionalism.",
      "The White House now appears to be strongarming Kyiv into economic, territorial and political concessions, with Trump himself berating Zelenskyy -- celebrated by many Americans for his stoic wartime stewardship -- as a \"dictator without elections\" who \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and his top officials have pushed back, noting that Ukraine is unable to hold new elections while under martial law. Kyiv has said it is happy to work with the new administration on mutually beneficial economic and security deals, while urging American partners to treat Moscow's narrative with skepticism. Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday voted to affirm Zelenskyy's legitimacy and agree that no elections can be held while the war continues.",
      "The situation is \"beyond disturbing\" for Kyiv, a source close to the Ukrainian government told ABC News. \"It's hard to imagine that it can be pulled back.\"",
      "Ukraine's leadership is trying to chart a course through the minefield of Trump's second term, the source added.",
      "\"They feel that they're striking this balance of not being impolite or disrespectful when it comes to countering some of the things that, again, at the end of the day, no Ukrainian leader can accept,\" the source said.",
      "\"They feel that they're managing it well, which doesn't mean that they don't have anxiety,\" they added. \"They do, because it is a fact that they rely on U.S. support, it is a fact that Europe cannot totally compensate for that support.\"",
      "\"They're striking this balance of pushing back, but not in a way where they're coming off as totally obstructionist and obstinate,\" the source continued.",
      "This month's historic U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh laid bare the new administration's approach to Moscow. The two sides agreed to normalize diplomatic relations and continue talks aimed at ending Russia's war, all without Ukraine's involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's bid to win access to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Ukrainian mineral resources further unsettled Kyiv. \"We're going to get our money back,\" the president said of the would-be deal, the first draft of which Zelenskyy rejected, declaring, \"I can't sell our state.\"",
      "But after a week of intense negotiations, both sides now suggest they have all but reached a deal, with Trump saying Monday he expects to see Zelenskyy in Washington next week.",
      "The reversal of the U.S. approach is striking. Where once Biden and his team refused to engage with Moscow outside of an unprecedented sanctions campaign, Trump and his top officials are now lauding a revival in bilateral ties.",
      "Where Biden once led the \"ironclad\" commitment to defending Ukraine against Kremlin aggression \"for as long as it takes,\" Trump falsely suggested Ukraine \"should have never started\" the war.",
      "The Biden administration's steady flow of vital military and economic aid, meanwhile, has been replaced with Trump's push to recoup what he sees as poorly invested American money. \"I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,\" Trump told CPAC on Saturday.",
      "The president has focused in on the value of American aid to Kyiv, which he claims is as high as $500 billion. Zelenskyy disputed the figure and said American aid was given as grants, not loans. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy -- a research institute in Germany that tracks foreign aid to Ukraine -- said the U.S. has contributed around $119 billion to Ukraine over three years of war. The majority -- $67 billion -- was in the form of military equipment.",
      "America's rising Ukraine-skepticism is being expressed on all fronts. In an extraordinary illustration of the re-alignment on Ukraine, the U.S. sided with Russia in a vote against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia, which passed on Monday with the support of the U.S.' traditional Western allies. The UN Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution which called for an end to the conflict without criticizing Russia. France and the U.K. abstained on the UNSC vote.",
      "Zelenskyy has said Ukraine will not agree to any peace deal that does not protect it against renewed Russian aggression. The Trump administration's rapid policy shift has pushed European allies to mobilize to provide their own long-term support -- and protection -- of Ukraine. Britain, France and others are discussing deploying European troops to Ukraine to guard any peace deal.",
      "Though financially and logistically dependent on foreign partners, Ukraine's armed forces are among the world's most potent and experienced. Zelenskyy said in January that 980,000 Ukrainians are now under arms, dwarfing any other European military.",
      "Despite Trump's unproven claims to the contrary, well-respected polling organizations in Ukraine have found that Zelenskyy retains the trust of the majority of Ukrainians. His compatriots want the war to end on what they consider fair terms, but a December survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll indicates that 57% are prepared to carry the conflict's burden for as long as necessary, despite heavy casualties, ongoing attacks on infrastructure and severe economic strain.",
      "There are more testing days to come. Moscow has said that the U.S. and Russian negotiating teams will meet for a second round of talks within the next two weeks.",
      "\"It should not look like Americans and Russians are trying to reach a deal about Ukraine's fate behind our backs,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party, told ABC News.",
      "\"But what is really important for us is that such communication between Americans and Russians should not lead to the decisions concerning Ukraine,\" said Merezhko, who is also the chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee.",
      "\"I hope that it might be a part of a political game on the part of Trump, who is trying to lure Putin into negotiations to demonstrate to his voters that he is at least trying to deliver on his promise,\" Merezhko added.",
      "\"That's why we need constant communication with Trump and his team -- if there is a vacuum, it can be filled by pro-Russian narratives.\"",
      "Yuriy Boyechko, the founder and CEO of the Hope for Ukraine charity, told ABC News he believes Trump \"is taking a side of the aggressor.\"",
      "\"Ukrainians won't sign a surrender,\" he added. \"We will keep on fighting to preserve a free and democratic Ukraine even if our top ally -- the U.S. -- walks away. We have no other choice.\"",

      "The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August of 2021.",
      "Markets on Wall Street immediately drooped. The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.7%. The Nasdaq declined 1.4%.",
      "Respondents to the board's survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.",

      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.",
      "Consumers\u2019 view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\u201cViews of current labor market conditions weakened,\u201d the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\u201d",

This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues that affect it.

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:51:03 -0500",
    "summary": "A State Department official told leaders of foreign aid groups that U.S. foreign aid funding was undergoing \"radical change,\" according to audio obtained by ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "ABC News obtained audio of a \"listening session\" hosted by the State Department.",
      "Pete Marocco, the Trump administration official tasked with the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), at a private \"listening session\" held at the State Department earlier this month with dozens of aid groups -- some on the brink of financial collapse -- made a request prior to the start of the meeting, according to multiple people who were in the room: that everyone stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.",
      "Inside the Loy Henderson Conference Room, representatives from aid organizations, industry groups, and foreign embassies -- reeling from the administration's sweeping freeze on foreign aid and the unraveling of USAID -- dutifully rose to their feet.",
      "The aid groups were there in the hope that Marocco would provide answers on the future of foreign assistance. After the Pledge, Marocco outlined the Trump administration's foreign aid plans, defending what he called a \"total zero-based review,\" and arguing that some areas of foreign aid required \"radical change\" before taking questions from those in attendance, according to an audio recording of the private meeting obtained by ABC News.",
      "Multiple sources who attended the Feb. 13 meeting described the mood in the room as \"deeply uncomfortable,\" saying that some of the attendees who were representing groups teetering on bankruptcy were left \"traumatized\" by the tone and the lack of specific details.",
      "During the discussion, a representative for World Vision, a global Christian humanitarian organization, asked Marocco about the impact of the freeze, noting that aid groups like his had been forced to bankroll U.S. government-funded programs with private money while awaiting overdue payments to be unpaused.",
      "\"Will the spigot open? We've gotten waivers, but the PMS system isn't operating, so we're bankrolling U.S. government-funded programs out of private money,\" said Edward Brown, the vice president of World Vision, which provides poverty alleviation, disaster relief, and child welfare in nearly 100 countries.",
      "Marocco responded that following President Donald Trump's executive order halting foreign aid, some transactions were still being processed, prompting his team to \"seize control\" of the payment system to stop them -- leaving some groups without payments that, weeks later, had still had not arrived.",
      "\"As far as payment, one of the reasons that there have been problems with some of the payments is because, despite the president's executive order, despite the secretary's guidance, we still had nefarious actors in the agencies that were trying to push out hundreds of illegal payments,\" Marocco said. \"And so we were able to seize control of that, stop them, take control of some of those people, and make sure that that money was not getting out the door.\"",
      "Marocco suggested that payments for organizations with existing contracts would resume the following Tuesday.",
      "\"I feel confident we're going to have that pretty good by Tuesday of next week,\" he said. \"That does not mean everybody's going to be caught up on everything that they want. But I think that our payment system will probably be fluid at that point.\"",
      "But Tuesday came and went, and many groups say they were still on the edge of bankruptcy -- prompting some to escalate their legal battle against the administration.",
      "On Monday, several USAID officials told ABC News that the payment system Marocco said would be fully restored was now technically operational, but that funding was still moving at an extremely slow pace and that many of the programs that were granted waivers to continue operations had still not received any money.",
      "USAID officials said the lack of funding has rendered many of the exempted programs inoperative. Some have resorted to using stockpiled resources, but because these programs have been cut off from federal support for weeks, most report that they have few funds left and don't anticipate they will be able to function for much longer, according to the officials.",
      "On Friday, after a federal judge cleared the way for the administration to proceed with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the U.S. and around the world, the Trump administration moved forward with its effort to dismantle USAID, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday.",
      "In a court-ordered affidavit filed last Tuesday, Marocco wrote that the agency \"has authorized at least 21 payments\" for grants, loans, and other foreign aid executed before Trump's inauguration \"that are in total worth more than $250 million and are expected to be paid this week.\"",
      "As of Monday, it was not clear whether those payments had been made.",
      "When reached for comment, World Vision would not confirm to ABC News if payments had resumed, but told ABC News they were \"complying with the executive order that pauses U.S. foreign assistance funding -- with potential waivers for emergency food and lifesaving humanitarian assistance -- for the next 90 days, while programs are reviewed for alignment with the current administration's foreign policy.\"",
      "In one tense moment during the listening session, a senior Democratic Senate staffer pressed Marocco on whether, once the payments resumed, they would include reimbursements for work incurred before the Jan. 24 freeze.",
      "\"When payments resume, will they include work incurred before Jan. 24 in the payments forthcoming on Tuesday?\" asked the staffer, who, when reached for comment by ABC News, asked not to be named our of fear of retribution.",
      "Marocco would not guarantee that government-contracted work that occurred before the freeze would be reimbursed, stating that the Trump administration would only cover \"legitimate expenses\" -- and noting that the administration's definition of a legitimate expense may differ from the groups in the room.",
      "\"We will be looking at those,\" Marocco said. \"What we consider to be legitimate may not be the same thing that other people consider to be legitimate, but we're going to.\"",
      "The staffer attempted to follow up, arguing that if the work had been incurred before the freeze, \"it was legitimate at the time, right?\"",
      "\"We've moved on to the next person,\" Marocco responded.",
      "In his affidavit filed on Tuesday, Marocco conveyed the scope and status of the government's aid freeze. He wrote that, since Trump signed the executive order for a 90-day freeze, USAID had terminated nearly 500 grants and contracts. He said the agency \"has not quantified\" the total cost of those programs.",
      "As of Tuesday, the State Department had terminated more than 750 foreign assistance-funded grants and contracts of its own and had suspended nearly 7,000 more, Marocco wrote.",
      "Marocco used the meeting with the organizations to paint a dire picture of U.S. foreign aid, claiming it had \"devolved into a fiscal cycle of dependency, of presumption, arrogance, and frankly, folly, that is just astonishing.\" He dismissed past reform efforts as ineffective, arguing that officials had merely \"nibbled around the edges\" rather than addressing what he saw as systemic failures.",
      "He insisted the review was necessary to force difficult conversations about \"what these programs are actually doing\" and whether they should continue at all. And he framed the overhaul as part of President Trump's broader effort to reshape Washington's approach to foreign assistance.",
      "\"The American people deserve better. They require better. And President Trump has promised better,\" he said, criticizing aid decisions made \"behind closed doors in Congress, in small groups in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Marocco told those gathered that the administration's review extended beyond USAID and would encompass a range of federal agencies, including NASA, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM).",
      "\"If there is a tax dollar that is going out to a foreigner, we need to gain control of that and understand what it is we're trying to achieve with our partners,\" he said. \"We want to identify all of that. We want to fix it. That's the goal.\"",
      "Marocco made clear that the new foreign aid structure would be tied to Trump's political priorities.",
      "\"With the Secretary of State, you will be in line,\" Marocco said. \"The foreign assistance review, you will follow the president's foreign policy objectives. Or you will not be spending money abroad.\"",
      "He told the aid groups in the room they needed to justify their programs.",
      "\"You need to think about convincing someone -- perhaps one of the women who is in my mother's Bible study,\" he said. \"You need to think about somebody who's working at a McDonald's in Mississippi. You need to think about a grad student in Harlem.\"",
      "Marocco also told those gathered that if they wanted funding to continue, they needed to ask themselves, \"Does it give the president real influence? Does this actually give the president national security and foreign policy influence abroad?\"",
      "If it doesn't, he said, \"I would say there is a slim chance that this actually is achieving anything that is worthwhile for American foreign policy.\"",
      "The Trump administration has received widespread condemnation from Democrats in Congress over its effort to slash foreign aid programs. \"What Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it's illegal,\" Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said earlier this month during a news conference outside USAID headquarters. \"USAID was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.\"",
      "The Feb. 13 meeting came as the legal battle over the aid freeze was escalating. Last week, a coalition of aid groups asked a federal judge to intervene, arguing that the freeze violated existing funding agreements and had caused \"catastrophic\" harm to their humanitarian missions. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali issued a temporary restraining order halting the freeze, but aid organizations said their funding remained locked, leaving them scrambling to keep operations afloat.",
      "Late Tuesday, Trump administration attorneys filed court papers arguing that their interpretation of the judge's order allows the freeze to largely remain in place. The aid groups fired back Wednesday, urging the court to enforce the ruling.",
      "\"The court should not brook such brazen defiance of the express terms of its order,\" they wrote in the filing.",
      "Judge Ali, a Biden-era appointee, wrote Thursday that while Trump administration officials had \"not complied\" with his order, he would not hold them in contempt of court.",
      "But he warned those officials not to buck what he characterized as his \"clear\" directive to lift their \"blanket freeze\" on aid disbursements.",

    "story": [
      "Bongino \"won't say no to any immoral or unethical act,\" Sen. Adam Schiff wrote.",
      "Dan Bongino, the former Secret Service agent turned Fox News host and conservative podcast personality, will be the next deputy director of the FBI -- a choice that is drawing criticism from Democrats as another one of President Donald Trump's allies moves into a leadership position.",
      "Trump named Dan Bongino, a 2020 election denier, as deputy FBI director on Sunday to serve under newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel. Bongino, who left Fox News in 2023, hosts the popular right-wing and pro-Trump podcast called \"The Dan Bongino Show,\" which ranks among Apple's top 10 news podcasts.",
      "On Monday morning, a very emotional Bongino told his show's listeners that he was sitting at home watching TV when Trump called him to let him know he was going to appoint him as the deputy director of the FBI. Bongino told listeners that he wanted the deputy FBI director job.",
      "\"I got a call from the president, and he couldn't have been nicer, and obviously, keep the contents of it between us, but I think you get the gist about what it was about and I kind of broke down a bit,\" he said. \"This is now real.\"",
      "Typically, the position of FBI's deputy director is held by a career agent -- something Bongino is not. The FBI's deputy director is responsible for the day-to-day operations and running the agency. The position does not require Senate confirmation.",
      "Democrats have expressed outrage at the pick of Bongino as a leader in the agency, concerned that Trump could use his allies leading the agency to go after his adversaries.",
      "\"Trump installs another loyalist who won't say no to any immoral or unethical act,\" Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff wrote of Bongino on X, adding that his appointment degrades law enforcement agencies and public safety.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy wrote on X that \"Trump has chosen grifters to lead the FBI.\"",
      "\"Kash Patel sells 'K$SH' branded merch, vaccine reversal pills. Dan Bongino's entire show is telling listeners the world is ending so they buy the dozens of survivalist products he sells,\" Murphy wrote on X.",
      "Bongino defended his appointment and said the job as the FBI's deputy director is \"unquestionably nonpartisan.\"",
      "\"I'm going to ask you a simple question, have you seen what I did before I came here,\" Bongino said on his podcast. \"I'm committed to service. People play different roles in their lives: People are dads, people are soccer coaches. People are cops and military officers and military-enlisted people. People are carpenters, people are plumbers. We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.\"",
      "Bongino joins an agency -- like many others -- undergoing changes under the Trump administration. In a message to the FBI workforce last week, Patel announced his intention to \"reduce the footprint\" of the FBI in \"the National Capital Region,\" including by \"reallocating personnel to the field offices and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville [Alabama].\" One source told ABC News this could include as many as 1,500 agents and others from Washington being relocated.",
      "The FBI, Bongino said, belongs to the American people and will work to restore trust in the agency. Bongino has said the FBI is \"lost, broken\" and \"irredeemably corrupt,\" when talking about the raid on Trump's Palm Beach home in 2022.",
      "\"Every single DNA cell in my body is going to be dedicated towards keeping this homeland safe, no matter what, no matter what, that's my job,\" he said. \"We're going to reestablish faith in this institution, the good people that are doing their job, hitting the streets, developing sources. We'll have your back. We are going to reestablish faith in this institution.\"",
      "The son of a plumber and a supermarket employee, Bongino grew up in Queens, New York, and started his career as a New York Police Department officer in the 1990s.",
      "Bongino said in his 2013 book, \"Life Inside the Bubble,\" that joining law enforcement was a \"dream of his\" and he dedicated himself to his beat.",
      "After leaving the NYPD, Bongino joined the Secret Service where he rose to the ranks and joined former President Barack Obama's protection detail.",
      "He said he was compelled to run for Congress in Maryland in 2014 after leaving the service because of \"the fog of scandals in the Obama administration,\" he told ABC News in 2013.",
      "Bongino claimed that he overheard a series of secret negotiations around the Affordable Care Act during Obama's first term, which drove him to leave the service and enter politics.",
      "That campaign was unsuccessful, but it allowed Bongino to develop a platform to speak on conservative issues.",
      "Bongino has been an outspoken supporter of Trump, and told Fox News in 2017 that the Trump-Russia collusion investigation into the 2016 presidential campaign was a \"total scam.\"",
      "He also questioned the results of the 2020 election and claimed there were \"anomalies\" with the voting totals. Despite the numerous false allegations of fraud in the 2020 election, there has been no evidence to back them up.",
      "After Trump was shot during the 2024 campaign, Bongino was critical of the agency he now helps lead.",
      "\"They absolutely, resolutely, 100% failed,\" he said of the Secret Service on Fox News in July. He also called for the firing of then-Deputy Director Ron Rowe in addition to the then-Director Christopher Wray.",

      "The Office of Personnel Management -- effectively the human resources agency for the federal government -- updated agency human resources officers on a Monday call over Elon Musk's call for the Trump administration to fire federal workers who did not reply to an email asking them to submit an email listing their accomplishments from the previous week.",
      "Adding to the confusion are Trump's own comments Monday, when he told journalists in the Oval Office there was a \"lot of genius\" behind Musk's proposal, and that workers would be \"sort of semi-fired\" if they don't respond.",
      "OPM did not respond to a request for comment on the instructions given to federal agencies.",
      "In the latest effort by the Department of Government Efficiency to investigate efficiency and reduce the size of the government, employees were asked in an email from the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday to list five accomplishments over the previous week and reply by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday.",
      "Musk threatened on social media that employees would face termination if they do not comply. The original email sent to employees did not include such an ultimatum, leaving some employees unaware of the threat.",
      "However, some federal agencies told employees not to respond to the OPM email, some advised that employees should reply and others said that replying is \"voluntary,\" creating uncertainty among the rank and file.",
      "Musk's ultimatum raised questions about how much authority he holds in the government. While the White House argued in a court filing that Musk has no true power, Musk doubled down on his ultimatum Monday morning, warning that \"Those who do not take this email seriously will soon be furthering their career elsewhere.\"",
      "Trump endorsed the email while taking questions Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I thought it was great because we have people that don't show up to work, and nobody even knows if they work for the government,\" Trump said. \"So, by asking the question, 'Tell us what you did this week,' what he's doing is saying, 'Are you actually working?'\"",
      "\"And then if you don't answer like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist,\" Trump said.",
      "Asked later Monday about the change in OPM policy, a White House official said, \"DOGE is moving fast, at the direction of POTUS, and that\u2019s exactly the point.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s all about efficiency, even internally,\" the official added.",
      "In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cEveryone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump. Any notion to the contrary is completely false.\"",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Federal employees on Saturday began receiving the OPM email with the subject line \"What did you do last week\" that demanded they list \"5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and CC your manager,\u201d according to multiple sources and an email reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The subject line came from Musk's playbook: \u201cWhat did you get done this week?\u201d is the same message he sent to the CEO of Twitter (now X) Parag Agrawal before Musk bought the company and fired the CEO.",
      "A spokesperson from the Office of Personnel Management said Saturday that \"agencies will determine any next steps.\"",
      "Yet management at multiple agencies told their staff that they were waiting on further guidance and, in some cases, told them to hold off on replying, according to multiple sources.",
      "Employees at the Justice Department were told that they did not need to respond to the OPM request, according to an email obtained by ABC News. The Defense Department told employees who received the email to \u201cplease pause any response.\u201d The Pentagon official filling in as the Department\u2019s top personnel officer said that DOD would review any performance of personnel according to its own procedures, but added that \u201cwhen and if required\u201d it would coordinate responses to OPM\u2019s email.",
      "Newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel also told staff to \"please pause any responses\" to the email.",
      "Employees at agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Department of Energy were told by senior staff that they were waiting on further guidance and, in some cases, told to wait for further notice before responding.",
      "NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro informed employees on Monday before OPM's guidance went out that responding to the email was optional and that not responding would have \"no impact to your employment,\" according to an email obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"Employees may have already responded or may still choose to respond. You are not required to respond, and there is no impact to your employment with the agency if you choose not to respond,\" Petro wrote in the email.",
      "Other agencies directed employees to reply. Speaking to Fox News on Monday morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy explained why his employees should respond to Musk\u2019s email.",
      "\u201cIf you can't come up with five things that you did, maybe you shouldn't be employed here,\u201d Duffy said, calling it an \u201ceasy task\u201d that \u201chappens in the private sector all the time.\u201d",
      "Leadership at the Treasury Department sent an agency-wide email Monday morning instructing all employees -- including those at the IRS -- to comply with OPM\u2019s email by the deadline, according to an email obtained by ABC News.",
      "However, the email still left some employees confused, particularly because it does not clarify whether failure to respond by the deadline could result in termination.",
      "Federal workers who don't follow Musk on social media could be unaware there's an ultimatum on the table. While the administration did ask federal employees to list their accomplishments, the email did not state that those who failed to respond by the deadline would be fired.",
      "Employees across agencies told ABC News they hadn't seen Musk's threats until they were asked for their reaction to them.",
      "One IRS employee told ABC News that when they asked their direct managers whether not responding would result in them being fired, they were told, \u201cWe are only to adhere to official emails and ignore any directives not communicated through official channels.\u201d",
      "Another employee in management at the IRS said staff are \"freaking out.\"",
      "Managers at the Department of Veterans Affairs told employees to respond to the email. One manager at the agency told ABC News that workers are \u201cscared.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration,\" they said. \"Everybody is afraid they are going to lose their jobs on a daily basis. There\u2019s this fear that you\u2019re going to open your email and you will be terminated.\u201d",
      "How much authority does Musk have?",
      "It is not clear if Musk has the authority to terminate employees in this manner. However, he continues to act as if he does, threatening employees on Monday morning with administrative leave if they do not return to work this week.",
      "White House lawyers attested in federal court that Musk \u201chas no actual or formal authority to make government decisions.\u201d",
      "Trump aides have also said publicly that Musk is operating in an advisory capacity as a special government employee.",
      "While Trump has said that Musk cannot do anything without his approval, the president has publicly heralded Musk as the leader of DOGE and lauded him for the job he's doing in that capacity. On Saturday, shortly before the OPM email went out, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, \"ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.\"",

    "summary": "ABC News reports on the first 30 days of billionaire Elon Musk advising President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
    "story": [
      "The billionaire is advising the president's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Elon Musk is the world's richest man. He's revolutionized electric cars as CEO of Tesla, launched rockets as head of SpaceX and seized control of a social media platform by buying Twitter for $44 billion.",
      "The South African-born businessman spent $270 million to help President Donald Trump get reelected. When Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, he empowered Musk to slash federal spending and make key decisions about the future of the U.S. as a lead adviser in the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "The following day, the Office of Personnel Management -- which acts as the government's human resources department -- directed agencies to compile a list of workers whose positions could be eliminated.",
      "By Jan. 22, there was a federal hiring freeze. All agencies were directed to put diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) staff on leave, related programs were shuttered and employees were ordered to remove pronouns from their signatures.",
      "The next several days set off confusion and panic for many workers across the country. A federal funding freeze briefly denied Head Start -- free early childhood development programs designed to help low-income households -- access to funding on Jan. 27, despite a federal judge's court order to the contrary.",
      "Then, on Jan. 28, some 2 million federal workers received an email with an offer to resign and be paid through September or risk being fired. The email subject line \"Fork in the road\" mirrored the language Musk used when he slashed Twitter's workforce in 2022.",
      "Within 30 days, DOGE gained access to personal information of millions of Americans through at least 15 federal agencies. Much of Musk's staff consisted of young engineers who moved into the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.",
      "Musk initially wanted an office in the West Wing, but told people he thought what he was given was too small, multiple people familiar with his comments told ABC News earlier this month.",
      "Only Congress has the power to eliminate entire agencies, but Musk and his team proved they can still be stripped down when they went into the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).",
      "\"DOGE was in the building. We took down our Pride flags,\" USAID contractor Kristina Drye told ABC News on Feb. 3. \"I took out any books I felt would be incriminating. No one was talking.\"",
      "At the same time, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) workers were told to stay home -- its headquarters closed and all work stopped. The consumer watchdog was created after the 2008 financial crisis and housing crash to protect American families from unfair and deceptive practices.",
      "Around 75,000 workers took the Trump administration's offer to resign, according to the White House. However, some people -- like Kansas-based Department of Agriculture natural resource specialist Nick Detter -- say they accepted within the timeframe and were fired anyway. The administration acknowledged that this has happened by mistake.",
      "\"I would never say that there's no room for improvement, efficiency in the federal government,\" Detter told ABC News. \"But in my experience over the last month with this whole thing, that's not what this has been.\"",
      "After the buyout offer closed, many federal workers said they started receiving emails and calls informing them that they were fired. Justine Beaulieu, who worked for the Department of Agriculture until last week, said she was among them.",
      "\"I was three days away from my due date on Friday when I got that termination letter. And I had my baby yesterday, right on time,\" she told ABC News. \"Paid maternity leave is off the table, and my health insurance is set to lapse at the end of this month.\"",
      "The administration has been reversing course in some cases, working to rehire the workers who manage the country\u2019s nuclear weapons and the inspection officers who worked on containing the bird flu outbreak.",
      "Musk has been designated as a special government employee. His companies Tesla and SpaceX have been awarded $18 billion in federal contracts over the last decade. Some of this money has come from agencies the president asked Musk to review, but Musk dismissed the notion that there could be conflicts of interest.",
      "\"No, because you have to look at the individual contract and say, first of all, I'm not the one, you know, filing the contract -- it's people at SpaceX,\" he told ABC News on Feb. 11.",
      "On the same day, Trump assured ABC News any possible conflicts of interest would be addressed.",
      "\"If we thought that, we would not let him do that segment or look in that area, if we thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest,\" the president said.",
      "Trump has fired independent watchdogs like Defense Department Inspector General Robert Storch.",
      "\"When you just wholesale fire people like that without giving any reasons for doing it, it sends a message that that sort of oversight, that productive oversight, isn't really valued,\" Storch told ABC News on Feb. 12.",
      "The total savings DOGE has made so far is still unclear, but the group's work has already set the stage for one of the biggest modern shakeups of the federal government.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 19:12:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Efforts by a White House intermediary to push the DOJ to hire candidates with \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump sparked clashes with AG Pam Bondi's top aide, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The White House intermediary, Paul Ingrassia, has clashed with Chad Mizelle.",
      "As the Trump administration continues to vet potential candidates for top posts within the Justice Department, a powerful White House intermediary has been pushing to hire candidates that exhibit what he called \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump, and his efforts sparked clashes with Attorney General Pam Bondi's top aide, Chad Mizelle, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The White House intermediary, Paul Ingrassia, complained directly to Trump about Mizelle, the Justice Department's chief of staff, and suggested to the president that Mizelle is hurting Trump's political agenda, sources said. Ingrassia has since been reassigned to work with the Department of Homeland Security, a White House official familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Trump was reelected in November after promising to rid the Justice Department of what he alleged was political bias tainting federal law enforcement. Bondi has echoed that rhetoric, issuing a directive within hours of taking office to establish a \"Weaponization Working Group\" that she said would review all of the \"politicized\" investigations previously targeting Trump.",
      "According to Ingrassia's LinkedIn page, he became \"President Trump's White House Liaison for DOJ\" in January. In private, to White House colleagues, he described himself as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" at the Justice Department, with significant authority to help interview and select candidates for senior and lower-level positions, sources said.",
      "Soon after the White House announced Ingrassia's appointment, Ingrassia began occupying an office on the fifth floor of the Justice Department, in an area typically reserved for the most senior staff in the attorney general's office, according to sources.",
      "But in the wake of Ingrassia's growing clashes with Mizelle, Mizelle took steps to have Ingrassia removed from the Justice Department and assigned to another agency -- a move that irritated some senior White House officials, sources said. Ingrassia complained to associates earlier this month that he had been locked out of his Justice Department devices, said sources.",
      "He is now serving as a liaison to DHS, helping with staffing there, the White House official told ABC News.",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News, but White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said ABC News' reporting on this matter is \"riddled with falsehoods,\" without indicating specifically what information he believes is false.",
      "\"Everyone is working as one unified team to staff the DOJ with patriots who are committed to Making America Safe Again,\" Fields said in a statement.",
      "Infighting became almost commonplace during Trump's first term, with one former Trump aide even titling his 2019 memoir about that administration, \"Team of Vipers.\"",
      "Recently, Ingrassia told colleagues that finding candidates for Justice Department roles who are loyal to Trump is a top priority for him, and he privately claimed that even rank-and-file career prosecutors within the department are corrupt, sources told ABC News.",
      "Ingrassia insisted to colleagues that anyone who worked under the Biden administration's attorney general, Merrick Garland, or under attorney general Bill Barr during Trump's first administration, should be presumed as unqualified to work for Trump's new administration, sources said.",
      "If taken literally and broadly, that could implicate nearly every current employee of the Justice Department.",
      "Sources said Mizelle resisted Ingrassia's hard-line approach, leading Ingrassia to accuse Mizelle of disrespecting him and improperly making unilateral personnel decisions, sources said.",
      "Among the candidates that sources said Ingrassia has been trying to place within the Justice Department is attorney John Pierce, who represented many of the defendants who were pardoned or had their sentences commuted by Trump's recent executive order related to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Ingrassia pushed for Pierce to take over the office within the Justice Department that helps the White House vet pardon requests, the sources said.",
      "In his first several weeks as the Justice Department's chief of staff, Mizelle himself has played a public role in promoting the Trump administration's agenda. When Bondi held her first press conference two weeks ago to announce a civil lawsuit against state leaders in New York for their immigration policies that she said value \"illegal aliens over American citizens,\" Mizelle stood on stage behind her and helped answer a question from a reporter.",
      "On Friday, Mizelle filed a publicly-released complaint with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, accusing a federal judge of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" in his handling of a case challenging Trump's recent efforts to limit or ban transgender service members. The judge has not yet responded to the complaint.",
      "Ingrassia, before joining the Trump administration last month, led communications efforts for a nonprofit legal organization that promotes itself as \"the answer to the useless and radically leftist American Civil Liberties Union,\" and he was a writer for the right-wing website Gateway Pundit.",
      "Trump was known to repost some of Ingrassia's pro-Trump stories on social media.",
      "Ingrassia graduated from Cornell Law School in May 2022, less than three years ago, according to his LinkedIn page. For several months in 2023, he worked as a law clerk and summer associate at the New York-based McBride Law Firm, which online promotes its work fighting \"the Department of Justice's malicious prosecution and horrific treatment of January 6th Detainees.\"",
      "Between 2021 and 2023, Ingrassia also worked for the law firm led by New York attorney Marc Kasowitz, who was previously a longtime personal attorney for Trump and represented him in the government's investigations of alleged ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government.",
      "In January, after becoming the White House liaison to the Justice Department, he wrote on social media that the Trump administration has \"a mandate from the American people [to] rebuild trust and confidence in our justice system by realigning it with its Constitutional prerogative.\"",
      "\"The era of WEAPONIZED JUSTICE ends TODAY,\" he wrote. \"GOD BLESS AMERICA AND MAGA.\"",
      "During her confirmation hearing, Bondi assured senators that she would \"not politicize\" her office.",
      "\"I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation. Justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country,\" she vowed.",

      "Three years later, the ravaged nation is still living under the extraordinary powers granted to the government in order to sustain its defensive and existential war against President Vladimir Putin's invading Russian forces. Powers that Russia is wielding to undermine the country's wartime leader.",
      "Under the Ukrainian constitution, elections -- whether presidential or parliamentary -- cannot be held while martial law is in force.",
      "Moscow has for months been seeking to weaponize Ukraine's democratic freeze, with Putin and his allies framing Zelenskyy as illegitimate and therefore unsuitable to take part in peace talks.",
      "President Donald Trump now appears to be lending his weight to the Kremlin's campaign.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump criticized his Ukrainian counterpart as \"a dictator without elections\" -- prompting widespread consternation of Trump's remarks both within the U.S. and especially among European allies.",
      "Trump also claimed -- without offering evidence -- that Zelenskyy's public approval rating was \"down to 4%.\" Recent major surveys show Zelenskyy's approval rating at above 50%.",
      "The push for new elections is \"not a Russia thing,\" Trump said. \"That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.\"",
      "A source close to the Ukrainian government -- who did not wish to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly -- told ABC News they believe the push is coming from those who \"believe that Zelenskyy, personally, is a problem because he is not compliant enough, he's not simply going to accept anything that they propose or anything that they demand.\"",
      "Kyiv has repeatedly warned that elections during wartime would be severely destabilizing. If Ukraine is forced into a rush and insecure election, \"We could see absolute political chaos in Kyiv,\" the source said.",
      "In reality, until now, the legitimacy argument has come almost exclusively from Moscow.",
      "\"You can negotiate with anyone, but because of his illegitimacy, he has no right to sign anything,\" Putin said of Zelenskyy in January, repeating his false claim that Ukraine's inability to hold elections in 2024 meant that the president's term had expired.",
      "The country's parliament and its speaker \"remain the only legitimate authorities in Ukraine,\" Putin said in May 2024.",
      "Foreign allies of Kyiv have dismissed Putin's claims, noting the totalitarian nature of Kremlin rule and Russia's own carefully managed electoral theater, that has kept Putin in power for more than two decades.",
      "They have also pushed back Trump's attacks on Zelenskyy, with most leaders expressing solidarity with him. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz -- for example -- said it was \"wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy democratic legitimacy.\" Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer also said it was \"reasonable\" not to hold elections during wartime, following a call with Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump's domestic allies mobilized to support the president and criticize Zelenskyy. Elon Musk, for example, said Trump \"is right to ignore\" the Ukrainian president. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters, \"We need elections in Ukraine,\" while Sen. Josh Hawley likewise said Zelenskyy \"should hold an election.\"",
      "Most Ukrainian politicians and experts have warned that any contest held during wartime would be vulnerable to Russian interference, could not guarantee the representation of soldiers deployed on the battlefield or refugees displaced either internally or abroad, and would threaten to destabilize the state at its most vulnerable moment.",
      "Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News that Putin \"wants to use an election campaign during the war to undermine stability with Ukraine.\"",
      "\"Putin is trying to push this narrative through someone in Trump's entourage,\" Merezhko said.",
      "Trump's recent attacks on Zelenskyy appear to have bolstered the latter's political position. Allies and rivals alike rallied around the Ukrainian president's office in the aftermath of Trump's broadsides.",
      "\"Only Ukrainians have the right to decide when and under what conditions they should change their government,\" former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook. \"None of us will allow such elections before the end of the war. Our enemies and even our allies may not like it, but it is true.\"",
      "Serhiy Prytula -- another prominent political figure -- urged compatriots to \"ignore that rhetoric and 'dictator' accusations from Trump.\"",
      "The source close to the Ukrainian government said that certain figures in Trump's orbit want Zelenskyy replaced by a more malleable successor, one less likely to push back on controversial American efforts to force a peace deal.",
      "\"According to their logic, the problem here is not Russia or Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it's the 'the ongoing war,'\" the source said. \"What is the mechanism for changing that, and in their view creating the conditions for someone who would be more compliant in Kyiv? It's elections.\"",
      "The source said Trump's team are wrong to think that Zelenskyy is on unstable political ground. \"They're operating under all of these false assumptions, one of which is that if you hold elections in Ukraine, it will necessarily result in the success of a candidate who is willing to bend to whatever it is that Trump is demanding,\" they said.",
      "\"I don't think that they have anyone in mind,\" the source added. \"I just think that they're confident in their ability to either create that individual in a way, or to cut some sort of private deal with someone.\"",
      "Even if the U.S. and Russia succeeded in unseating Zelenskyy in favor of a more pliant successor, \"if you end up with leadership in Kyiv that is willing to cut some sort of deal that is absolutely unacceptable to a large segment of Ukrainian society, we could see fragmentation, even of the Ukrainian military,\" they said.",
      "\"If the Trump administration pushes this government, or any Ukrainian government, too far, I think that this scenario becomes a real one, and this is certainly not in Ukraine's interest or Europe's interest, but I don't see how it's in the interest of the United States either.\"",
      "For now, there appears little in the way of a concrete challenge to the incumbent.",
      "In Kyiv, Valerii Zaluzhnyi -- the former Ukrainian commander-in-chief who is now serving as Kyiv's ambassador to the U.K. -- is widely seen as the only real potential challenger to Zelenskyy.",
      "Zaluzhnyi publicly fell out with the president and his team -- prime among them Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy's office -- in late 2023 over public comments framing the war as a \"stalemate.\"",
      "It is not clear whether Zaluzhnyi would stand for election. The former commander-in-chief has dodged questions about any future political ambitions.",
      "But a November poll by the Social Monitoring Center organization put the former general at the top of preferred potential presidential candidates backed by 27% of 1,200 respondents. Zelenskyy trailed on 16%, with former President Petro Poroshenko on 7%.",
      "A February survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) indicated diminished trust in the current president compared to the extraordinary highs of the early months of the war. But it still remains high compared to most democratically-elected leaders. Public trust in Zelenskyy among 1,000 respondents was at 57% in February, compared with 77% in December 2023 and 90% in May 2022, around three months after Russia's invasion. The latest poll showed a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.",
      "Another recent poll by the Identity and Borders in Flux project in partnership with KIIS published on Feb. 19, showed two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of Zelenskyy's actions.",
      "The KIIS poll found that trust in Ukraine's civilian government overall fell to 26% -- a decline from 52% in 2023. In contrast, those surveyed reported overwhelming 96% trust in the Ukrainian military, with 88% saying they trust Zaluzhnyi.",
      "The showdown between Zelenskyy and Zaluzhnyi ended with the former assuming an ambassadorial posting to the U.K., in which the former general has maintained a relatively low media profile and avoided any public revival of tensions with the president.",
      "The same cannot be said for Poroshenko -- another potential electoral rival -- with whom the president is now locked in a very public battle. Earlier this month, Zelenskyy signed a decree sanctioning Poroshenko and several other politically connected wealthy Ukrainians for allegedly undermining national security.",
      "Poroshenko dismissed the sanctions as politically motivated and unconstitutional. \"Why are they doing this? Hatred, fear and revenge,\" he said in a statement. \"And because they have elections. Not us. The government.\"",
      "The IBF project poll showed a much lower proportion -- 26-32% -- of Ukrainians would vote for Zelensky in an election. But that still far outpaces Poroshenko, his nearest current rival, and remains far above the 4% figure put forward by Trump.",
      "Zelenskyy has been unclear on his own political goals. In 2022, the president said he will \"definitely\" remain in his post until Kyiv achieves victory. \"After that, I don't know,\" he added. \"I'm not thinking about that now, I'm not ready.\"",
      "Peace could prove perilous for Zelenskyy if Ukrainian voters do not agree with its terms.",
      "One former official -- who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation -- told ABC News the president \"needs to blame Trump\" if Ukraine is indeed forced into a controversial peace deal.",
      "\"He cannot stop this war now and take responsibility, because for him, it will be political suicide,\" they said.",

      "A Republican who left the Department of Government Efficiency initiative on President Donald Trump\u2019s first day has launched his bid for Ohio governor",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Vivek Ramaswamy, the Cincinnati-born biotech entrepreneur who departed the Department of Government Efficiency initiative on President Donald Trump's first day, launched his bid for Ohio governor Monday with promises to institute work requirements for Medicaid and merit pay for all public school teachers and administrators.",
      "Ramaswamy, 39, kicked off his campaign in Cincinnati, joining the 2026 Republican primary just a month after presumed frontrunner and then-Lt. Gov. Jon Husted left the running to take a U.S. Senate appointment.",
      "Ramaswamy sought the GOP nomination for president in 2024 before dropping out to back Trump, who later tapped him to co-chair the efficiency initiative with billionaire Elon Musk. A near-billionaire himself, Ramaswamy has promoted his ties to Trump as he lines up key endorsements and donors in the governor's race, but the president has made no formal endorsement yet.",
      "\u201cI spent most of last year working tirelessly to help send Donald Trump back to the White House because it was a fork in the road,\u201d Ramaswamy said to loud cheers from the crowd. \u201cIt was a fork in the road for the future of the country.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy joins a competitive GOP primary field to succeed Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, 78, a veteran center-right politician who is term-limited.",
      "Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost announced a bid for the seat in January and Heather Hill, a Black entrepreneur from Appalachia, also is running. Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director who helped lead Ohio through the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, is running as a Democrat.",
      "They will compete in a former bellwether state that has tacked reliably red in recent years, having voted for Trump three times by more than 8 percentage points. Republicans also hold every statewide executive office, a majority on the Ohio Supreme Court and supermajorities in both legislative chambers.",
      "Ramaswamy told the crowd at his campaign launch that he would \u201cend the war on work\u201d by reattaching work requirements to Medicaid and welfare.",
      "He vowed to eliminate income and property taxes, and he promised Ohio would be the first state in the nation to implement merit-based pay for every teacher, principal, superintendent and administrator.",
      "He spoke of Ohio's more prosperous days, when he said the state was home to the glass, rubber and steel capitals of the world. This could be the case again, he said, though in other industries like semiconductor production, nuclear energy, biotechnology and bitcoin.",
      "\u201cI believe deep in my bones that Ohio can lead the way again,\" he said. \u201cIf Silicon Valley was at the leading edge of the American economy for the last 10 years, it will be the Ohio River Valley for the next 10 years.\u201d",
      "Yost issued a statement welcoming Ramaswamy to the race \u201cfor however long he sticks around.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy, who is Hindu, outlined the 10 core beliefs featured in his presidential campaign \u2014 led by \u201cGod is real\u201d followed by \u201cthere are two genders\u201d \u2014 in the 2024 book \u201cTruths: The Future of America First.\u201d He first rose to political prominence with his 2021 book, \u201cWoke Inc: Inside Corporate America\u2019s Social Justice Scam,\u201d a scorching critique of corporations that he said use social justice causes as a smokescreen for self-interested policies.",
      "He seeks to buck the traditional route to Ohio's governorship, which runs through extensive government service often stretching decades, and instead mount a Trump-style ascent into the job directly from the business world.",
      "The formula has worked for Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, two political newcomers who won Senate seats with the help of Trump\u2019s endorsement in 2022 and 2024, respectively. But Ramaswamy will test it in a state government-level race for the first time in recent memory.",
      "DeWine passed Ramaswamy over to appoint Husted to the Senate seat vacated by Vance, citing Husted\u2019s decades of elective experience. The gubernatorial bid by Husted, a former Ohio House speaker and secretary of state, had locked down many key endorsements and wealthy donors, who are now largely free agents.",
      "Yost joined the race as rumors circulated that Ramaswamy was planning a run. Since then, however, Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.",

Borrenpohl is a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for a state legislative seat in 2024.",
      "\u201cShe repeatedly asked them to identify themselves,\u201d said Tonya Coppedge, who was sitting behind Borrenpohl and shot video of the disruption on her cellphone.

      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to respect the rights of the 450 people that were there to listen.

      "Videos of the event show multiple people there were cheering or jeering, including Borrenpohl. After one of the speakers asked the jeering to stop, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris approached Borrenpohl. He introduced himself and told her to leave or she would be escorted out. Then the sheriff stepped back and began recording on his cellphone as three unidentified men approached and began grabbing Borrenpohl.",
      "Borrenpohl repeatedly asked if the men are deputies but was given no answer. She fought to remain in her seat, but the men overpowered her, carrying her out of the venue."

      "The selection places two staunch Trump allies atop the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency at a time when Democrats are concerned that the president could seek to target his adversaries. Bongino would serve under Kash Patel, who was sworn in as FBI director at the White House on Friday and who has signaled his intent to reshape the bureau, including by relocating hundreds of employees from its Washington headquarters and placing greater emphasis on the FBI's traditional crime-fighting duties.",

      "Questioned by reporters in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis touted his wife as a staunch conservative who would build on his legacy and argued that the state's first lady could pull in even more voters than he did. DeSantis won a dominant reelection victory in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin.",

      "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- The lawyer for a Southern California judge acknowledged Monday that his client fired the deadly shot that killed his wife but contended it was an accident.",
      "Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Ferguson sat in the courtroom about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from where he previously presided over criminal cases, waiting for his turn to testify in his own trial. The 74-year-old judge is charged with the murder of his wife, Sheryl, for shooting her in August 2023 after the couple had been arguing about family finances while watching \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d on television.",
      "Ferguson\u2019s lawyer, Cameron J. Talley, said his client was an alcoholic and had been drinking when he began removing a gun he always carried with him in an ankle holster and went to place it on a table. Talley said Ferguson fumbled the gun, then reached to grab it and it went off with a \"bang.\"",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in shock,\u201d Talley told jurors, and called the shot an \u201caccidental discharge.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dreamlike to him, and it doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s a little drunk.\u201d",
      "The comments came during Talley\u2019s opening statement in a case that has roiled the legal community in Orange County, which is home to 3 million people between Los Angeles and San Diego. Ferguson, who is expected to testify this week, has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.",
      "Prosecutors allege Ferguson made a gun hand gesture toward his wife earlier in the evening after the couple argued about family finances while dining at a Mexican restaurant with their adult son, Phillip. Prosecutor Seton Hunt said the arguing continued at home until Sheryl Ferguson chided her husband to point a real gun at her, after which he did and pulled the trigger.",
      "Ferguson was taken into custody, and in comments captured on a police video recording, pleaded for a jury to convict him.",
      "\u201cI killed her,\u201d Ferguson is heard saying. \u201cI did it.\u201d",
      "Ferguson, who used to be a criminal prosecutor, has cried from his seat at the defense table during the trial. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eleanor J. Hunter, who is presiding over the case to avoid a conflict of interest, warned he won't be allowed to sob from the witness stand. \u201cHe's got to control himself,\u201d she said.",
      "The trial has included extensive footage from cameras worn by police officers who arrived at the couple's home in Anaheim Hills after the shooting. There is also video footage of Ferguson handcuffed at the police station following his arrest, in which he's seen sobbing and saying his son and everyone would hate him.",
      "Authorities said they found 47 weapons, including the gun from Ferguson's ankle holster, and more than 26,000 rounds of ammunition at the home. Hunt said Ferguson had ample experience and training in operating firearms, and Phillip Ferguson testified that his father taught him firearm safety, including to always point a weapon in a safe direction.",
      "Immediately after the shooting, Jeffrey Ferguson and his son both called 911, and Ferguson texted his court clerk and bailiff saying, \u201cI just lost it. I just shot my wife. I won\u2019t be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d according to a copy of a text message Hunt showed jurors.",
      "Ferguson was released on $1 million bail in 2023 but re-arrested last year after Hunter found he had lied about drinking alcohol in violation of his bail conditions. Ferguson was later released on $2 million bail.",
      "Ferguson has been an elected judge in Orange County for a decade but is not currently hearing cases. Under the state\u2019s constitution, a judge who faces a felony charge can continue to draw a salary but can\u2019t hear cases.",
      "Ferguson began his legal career in the district attorney\u2019s office in 1983 and went on to work narcotics cases, for which he won various awards, and was president of the North Orange County Bar Association from 2012 to 2014.",
      "He was admonished by the Commission on Judicial Performance in 2017 for posting a statement on Facebook about a judicial candidate \u201cwith knowing or reckless disregard for the truth of the statement,\u201d and for being Facebook friends with attorneys appearing before him in court, according to a copy of the agency\u2019s findings.",
      "On his Facebook page, Ferguson said he grew up in a military family and traveled throughout Asia as a child. He attended college and law school in California and married his wife in 1996.",

      "President Donald Trump says his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a monthlong suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that\u2019s moving along very rapidly,\u201d the U.S. president said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the U.S. president also stressed more broadly that his intended \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs. His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation. But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.",
      "\u201cOur country will be extremely liquid and rich again,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In a interview on the Fox News show \u201cSpecial Report\u201d late Monday, Macron said he hoped he had convinced Trump to avoid a possible trade war, noting the difficulty of taking on a traditional ally such as Europe while simultaneously using tariffs to challenge China's industrial might.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need a trade war,\" Marcon said. \"We need more prosperity together.\u201d",
      "Most economists say the cost of the taxes could largely be borne by consumers, retailers and manufacturers such as auto companies that source globally and rely on raw materials such as steel and aluminum that Trump is already, separately, tariffing at 25%.",
      "Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the U.S. government before the deadline set by Trump.",
      "\u201cWe would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,\u201d Sheinbaum told reporters Monday morning before Trump's remarks. \u201cOn all of the issues there is communication and what we need is to complete this agreement, I believe we\u2019re in a place to do it.\u201d",
      "If necessary, she said she would seek to speak directly with Trump again. In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the U.S. also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said.",
      "Companies like Walmart have warned about uncertainty, while the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment index plunged by roughly 10% over the past month in part due to fears about tariffs and inflation worsening. In the 2024 presidential election, voters backed Trump on the belief that he could cool inflation that had spiked to a four-decade high in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic during President Joe Biden's time in office.",
      "But Trump has persistently threatened tariffs and kept up those calls even as Macron, standing beside him, had previously suggested that talks on trade had produced some common ground.",
      "\u201cWe want to make a sincere commitment towards a fair competition where we have smooth trade and more investments,\u201d Macron said at the news conference, according to a translation of his French remarks.",
      "Macron said the idea is to help the U.S. and Europe both prosper, saying that further talks would be carried out by their respective teams to flesh out their ideas.",
      "Investors, businesses and the broader public are still trying to determine whether Trump is merely threatening tariffs as a negotiating tool or if he sincerely backs the tax hikes as a way to offset his planned income tax cuts.",
      "Despite talks the Trump administration has held with Canadian and Mexican officials, the U.S. president signaled Monday that he would end the 30-day suspension of tariffs that were initially set to take effect in February. Trump plans to tax imports from Mexico at 25% as well as most goods from Canada, with energy products such as Canadian oil and electricity being tariffed at a lower 10%.",
      "Trump is placing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods with the stated goal of pressuring them to do more to address illegal immigration and the smuggling of illicit drugs such as fentanyl. While relatively little fentanyl comes from Canada, the country announced a czar to address the issue and appease Trump in addition to existing measures. Mexico has relocated 10,000 members of its National Guard to the border with the United States in addition to existing measures.",
      "Trump also plans to impose new tariffs to match the rates charged by other countries. Set to begin as soon as April, the tariffs could be higher than what other countries would charge as subsidies, regulatory barriers and the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax common in Europe \u2014 would be included in the calculations.",
      "The possibility of retaliatory tariffs planned by Canada, Mexico and Europe could lead to a broader trade conflict that sabotage growth. In February, the Yale University Budget Lab estimated that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs could depress average U.S. incomes by $1,170 to $1,245 a year.",

      "The ubiquitous food delivery app DoorDash will pay almost $17 million to settle claims that it unfairly used customer tips to subsidize the wages of its delivery workers in New York, rather than let drivers keep the tips on top of their guaranteed pay",
      "NEW YORK -- The ubiquitous food delivery app DoorDash will pay almost $17 million to settle claims that it unfairly used customer tips to subsidize the wages of its delivery workers in New York, rather than letting drivers keep the tips on top of their guaranteed pay, Attorney General Letitia James said Monday.",
      "James said DoorDash used the wage model between May 2017 and September 2019. The company would guarantee workers a base payment for each delivery but was factoring tips into that equation, only paying workers for whatever the tips didn't cover, according to the attorney general.",
      "DoorDash also did not make it clear to customers that their tips were being used to offset worker wages, said James, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cThis is just fundamentally unfair,\u201d she said at a news conference in Manhattan. \u201dCustomers had no reason to believe that these tips were being used by DoorDash to reduce its costs.\"",
      "The company will pay $16.75 million in restitution that will be distributed to DoorDash workers who made deliveries between May 2017 and September 2019 in New York. Eligible workers will be contacted by a settlement administrator.",
      "In a statement, DoorDash said, \"While we believe that our practices properly represented how Dashers were paid during this period, we are pleased to have resolved this years-old matter and look forward to continuing to offer a flexible way for millions of people to reach their financial goals.\u201d",
      "The company said the old pay model is no longer in use.",

      "Jury selection is underway for the trial of the man accused of opening fire on a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade and killing seven people in 2022",
      "WAUKEGAN, Ill. -- The man accused of opening fire on a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade, killing seven people, is about to stand trial, nearly three years after the attack.",
      "Jury selection started Monday after several delays. Part of the reason is the erratic behavior of the defendant, Robert Crimo III, which has raised questions about what to expect at trial for the 2022 mass shooting.",
      "Opening statements are expected next week.",
      "Authorities allege a gunman perched on a roof shot at crowds assembled for a Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, a wealthy suburb 30 miles (50 kilometers) from Chicago.",
      "Seven people were killed in the 2022 shooting, including both parents of a toddler. Dozens more were wounded. They ranged in age from their 80s down to a then- 8-year-old boy who was left partially paralyzed.",
      "Witnesses described confusion as shots rang out, followed by terror as families abandoned the parade route, leaving behind lawn chairs and strollers to find safety inside homes and businesses.",
      "City leaders canceled the parade the following year but reinstated it in 2024 with a memorial for the victims.",
      "Mayor Nancy Rotering has said the city doesn\u2019t want to be defined by the mass shooting. This month, she announced the parade will return in July, but without fireworks, partly because of \u201ccommunity trauma.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s parade theme reminds us that teams bring people together in support of a common goal, and that we are most resilient when we support each other,\u201d Rotering said.",
      "Killed in the shooting were: Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Crimo was initially charged with 21 counts of first-degree murder \u2014 three counts for each person killed \u2014 as well as 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery. But on Monday, Lake County prosecutors sought to drop the less serious aggravated battery counts. They briefly noted the move ahead of jury selection without any explanation. Lake County Judge Victoria Rossetti signed the one-page order to dismiss the charges.",
      "The Lake County state's attorney's office declined to comment Monday.",
      "Prosecutors have turned over about 10,000 pages of evidence, as well as hours of a video-taped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old Crimo has since pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal.",
      "Court proceedings have made parts of the interrogation public, and defense attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have the videos thrown out, alleging Crimo's rights were being violated.",
      "Videos show officers repeatedly asking Crimo if he understood his Miranda rights, which include the right to remain silent and have an attorney present.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard them a million times,\u201d Crimo said at one point.",
      "Prosecutors also have shown footage of a person dressed in women's clothing and identified by police as Crimo headed toward the parade route on the morning of July 4, 2022.",
      "Something that could also hurt the defense is Crimo\u2019s unpredictable behavior in court.",
      "He didn\u2019t show up to two previous court hearings, refusing to leave his Lake County jail cell. And in June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he showed up to court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal, surprising even his lawyers. He also fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen at this point,\u201d said Eric Johnson, a law professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "Crimo\u2019s defense attorneys and Lake County prosecutors have repeatedly declined comment ahead of the trial.",
      "Crimo appeared in court Monday, wearing a suit and tie, clean shaven and with his hair cut short. He occasionally looked at jurors as they were being questioned and appeared to be jotting things down on paper. His parents sat in the row behind him.",
      "Crimo's father, Robert Crimo Jr., pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct. The charges focused on how his son obtained a gun license.",
      "In 2019, at age 19, Crimo III was only allowed to apply for a gun license with the sponsorship of a parent or guardian. His father agreed, even though a relative had reported to police that his son had a collection of knives and had threatened to \u201ckill everyone.\u201d",
      "Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate and former owner of a now-closed deli, has attended his son\u2019s court hearings, making eye contact with him during hearings. He declined to discuss the case in detail.",
      "\u201cAs a parent, I love my son very much and Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cI have no further comment.\u201d",
      "Potential jurors reported to the courthouse in Waukegan on Monday. The process began slowly, first with filling out extensive juror questionnaires followed by questioning by the judge and attorneys. Only three jurors were chosen by lunch Monday. Jury selection for the panel of 12 and six alternates is expected to last several days.",
      "Opening statements are scheduled for next week in what attorneys expect to be a roughly monthlong trial. But the high-profile nature of the case could complicate efforts to find a jury. All six of those who appeared for questioning Monday morning had heard of the shooting when it first happened, even one who was traveling to Greece at the time.",
      "Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence.",
      "Those who have spoken out declined interviews ahead of the trial. Some are expected to testify, along with police and a former school resource officer who encountered Crimo during middle and high school.",
      "Experts say attorneys will have to approach juror selection with extra care.",
      "\u201cThere is information that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Alan Tuerkheimer, who consults lawyers on jury strategy but isn\u2019t involved in the trial. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that has affected people in the community.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump holds talks this week with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump also has made demands for territory \u2014 Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal \u2014 as well as precious rare earth minerals from Ukraine. Just over a month into his second term, the \u201c America First \u201d president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America's calming presence of global stability and continuity.",
      "Despite some notable hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded.",
      "\u201cThe only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,\u201d said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administration and now a professor at Northwestern University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m discouraged for a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is that I had taken some encouragement at the beginning from the repeated references to \u2018peace through strength,'\u201d Kelly added. \u201cThis is not peace through strength \u2014 this is peace through surrender.\u201d",
      "Trump is set to host Macron on Monday, the three-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, while Starmer will be at the White House on Thursday.",
      "Their visits come after Trump shook Europe with repeated criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for failing to negotiate an end to the war and rebuffing a push to sign off on a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, which could be used in the American aerospace, medical and tech industries.",
      "European leaders also were dismayed by Trump's decision to dispatch top aides for preliminary talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian or European officials at the table.",
      "Another clash is set to play out at the U.N. on Monday after the U.S. proposed a competing resolution that lacks the same demands as one from Ukraine and the European Union for Moscow\u2019s forces to immediately withdraw from the country.",
      "On the minerals deal, Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said Sunday on X that \u201cwe are making great progress\u201c but noted that \"we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials say they expect to reach a deal this week that would tie the U.S. and Ukrainian economies closer together \u2014 the last thing that Russia wants.",
      "It follows a public spat, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and falsely charging Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022.",
      "Zelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, then angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space.\" Confronting Trump might not be the best approach, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe response to President Trump doing something to you is not to do something back right away. You tend to get this kind of reaction,\u201d said retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, former foreign policy aide to the late Sen. John McCain and current senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.",
      "He added, \u201cThis is part of a broader issue where I know the administration\u2019s characterizing themselves as disruptors. I think a better term might be destabilizers. And, unfortunately, the destabilizing is sometimes us and our allies.\u201d",
      "That complicated dynamic makes this week's task all the more difficult for Macron and Starmer, leaders of two of America's closest allies, as they try to navigate talks with Trump.",
      "Macron said he intends to tell Trump that it\u2019s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to show weakness to Putin during U.S.-led negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He also suggested that he'll make the case that how Trump handles Putin could have enormous ramifications for U.S. dealings with China, the United States' most significant economic and military competitor.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be weak in the face of President Putin. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not your trademark, it\u2019s not in your interest,\" Macron said on social media. \"How can you then be credible in the face of China if you\u2019re weak in the face of Putin?\u2019\u201d",
      "Yet, Trump has shown a considerable measure of respect for the Russian leader. Trump said this month that he would like to see Russia rejoin what is now the Group of Seven major economies. Russia was suspended from the G8 after Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region.",
      "Trump dismissed Zelenskyy's complaints about Ukraine and Europe not being included in the opening of U.S.-Russia talks, suggesting he's been negotiating \u201cwith no cards, and you get sick of it.\u201d",
      "Putin, on the other hand, wants to make a deal, Trump argued Friday. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to make a deal. Because if he wanted, he would get the whole country,\" Trump added.",

But Ukraine refused, and it will be put to a vote in the 193-nation assembly, two European diplomats said. All spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.",
      "It's a reflection of the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict.

      "Joliet, Ill. -- The trial of a suburban Chicago landlord accused of murder, attempted murder and a hate crime in a 2023 attack on a Palestinian American woman and her young son is set to start Tuesday.",
      "Joseph Czuba, 73, is charged in the fatal stabbing of six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of Hanan Shaheen on Oct. 14, 2023. Authorities said the family was targeted because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas that erupted on Oct. 7, 2023 with a Hamas attack on southern Israel.",
      "Opening statements start Tuesday morning in a trial that is expected to last about a week.",
      "Czuba has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and other charges. His defense attorney, George Lenard, declined to comment before the end of the trial.",
      "The attack on the family in Plainfield, nearly 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, has renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the Chicago area\u2019s large and established Palestinian community. The proceedings also come amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the U.S. since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "\u201cWe firmly pray and hope that Mr. Czuba will be locked up for the rest of his life, so we can send a message that hate crimes against anyone on the basis of their religion and national origin are not tolerated,\u201d Joe Milburn, a staff attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told reporters Monday ahead of jury selection.",
      "Prosecutors allege Czuba became increasing paranoid about the war because of listening to commentary on conservative talk radio. Shaheen told police that Czuba was upset over the war and attacked them after she had urged him to \u201cpray for peace.\u201d",
      "The boy \u2014 whose name was initially spelled Wadea Al-Fayoume by authorities \u2014 was stabbed 26 times. Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover.",
      "The murder charge in the indictment against Czuba describes the boy\u2019s death as the result of \u201cexceptionally brutal or heinous behavior.\u201d Czuba remained detained with prosecutors arguing that Czuba was a danger to Shaheen and others.",
      "Hundreds attended the boy\u2019s janazah, or funeral service, where the boy was remembered as kind and into sports and Legos.",
      "Separately, the father of the boy, who is divorced from Shaheen and did not live at the home, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit."

    "story": [
      "The Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot has died",
      "BELVEDERE, Calif. -- Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, has died. He was 93.",
      "Hill died Friday at his home in Belvedere, California, according to his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A cause of death was not given.",
      "Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president.",
      "\"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,\" a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\"",
      "It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened.",
      "On the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.",
      "Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.",
      "Zapruder's film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.",
      "Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.",
      "The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller \"In the Line of Fire,\" about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.",
      "Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.",
      "Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.",
      "\"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said.",
      "\"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" Wallace asked.",
      "\"The third shot, yes, sir,\" Hill said.",
      "\"And that would have been all right with you?\"",
      "\"That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.",
      "In his 2005 memoir, \"Between You and Me,\" Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.",
      "In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process.",
      "\"I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,\" he said. \"It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.\"",
      "Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books \u2014 including \u201cMrs. Kennedy and Me\u201d and \u201cFive Presidents\u201d \u2014 about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.",
      "\u201cWe had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,\u201d McCubbin Hill said in a statement. \u201cWe were soulmates.\u201d",
      "Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota's highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A portrait of Hill adorns a Capitol gallery of fellow honorees.",
      "A private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a future date.",

      "The lawsuit stems from the protests in 2016 and 2017 over the oil pipeline's planned Missouri River crossing, upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long argued that the pipeline threatens its water supply. Of the thousands of people who protested the project, hundreds were arrested.",

      "For the airports without control towers, pilots rely on radio communications and the principle of \u201csee and avoid\u201d to ensure they can maneuver safely. The concept is drilled into pilots from Day 1 of their training and it's applicable regardless of the kind of airspace they're in, said Mike Ginter, a retired Navy aviator and senior vice president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association\u2019s Air Safety Institute.",
      "He likened it to being behind the wheel of a car and practicing all the safety rules learned in driver's ed.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell the state police that you\u2019re getting ready to drive to the supermarket to get groceries. You just go out, and you look both ways before you turn, and you turn on your turn signal and you drive,\u201d he explained, saying there are basic tenets of safety that are ingrained in pilots.",
      "The system has worked well, considering the sheer number of planes coming and going daily from small airports and the roughly 26 million hours of flight time logged by general aviation pilots.",
      "It was a summer day in 1956 when two commercial flights left Los Angeles within minutes of each other \u2014 one en route to Chicago and the other to Kansas. Flying under visual flight rules, the planes collided over the Grand Canyon in Arizona, killing all 128 people aboard. The crash site is now a National Historic Landmark.",
      "Even though U.S. air traffic had more than doubled since the end of World War II, it was this disaster that helped to fuel efforts to overhaul aviation safety.",
      "Legislation was introduced in 1958 to create an independent federal agency that would provide for the safe and efficient use of national airspace. The bill was signed within months and the first Federal Aviation Agency administrator was appointed.",
      "Responsibilities evolved, and the agency became the Federal Aviation Administration as air traffic control systems were being modernized.",
      "Through the FAA, airports can apply for federal grants to modernize and build air traffic control towers that are staffed by private companies and contract workers, rather than FAA staff.",
      "Nearly 180 airports nationwide are eligible for funding under the program, with most looking to upgrade existing towers \u2014 some that date back to the 1940s and others that were meant to be temporary.",
      "A review of funding awarded through the program over the past four fiscal year shows a handful of airports were awarded money specifically for site studies, environmental work and construction of new towers. That includes airports in Bend, Oregon; Boulder City, Nevada; and Mankato, Minnesota.",
      "In the case of Marana, the airport was first accepted into the program in 2019 but the coronavirus pandemic stalled efforts to get a tower built by the five-year deadline. Airport officials have said they now are on track to complete the project by 2029.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump issued a memo in late January to top transportation officials, ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety following the midair collision of an Army helicopter and commercial passenger jet over the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. Sixty-seven people were killed.",
      "Trump raised questions about hiring practices within the FAA, suggesting previous Democratic administrations had shifted away from merit-based hiring.",
      "Some FAA jobs have been eliminated as Trump streamlines the federal workforce and looks to ferret out waste and curb spending, but less than 1% of the agency's more than 45,000 workers were probationary employees targeted as part of the job cuts, federal officials have said.",
      "In addition, the administration has said no air traffic controllers or critical safety personnel were fired as part of the effort. But labor and industry groups say even without cuts, air traffic control towers were already understaffed.",
      "Trump has said that he would support legislation aimed at modernizing the nation's air traffic control system. In a letter sent to members of Congress last week, the industry group Airlines for America pushed for emergency funding for critical air traffic control technology and infrastructure as well as air controller staffing and training.",

      "Michigan Republicans are gathering in Detroit to select a new chair to lead the party into the 2026 midterms, when several critical races will be decided in the battleground state",
      "DETROIT -- Michigan Republicans are gathering in Detroit on Saturday to elect a new chair who will lead the party into the 2026 midterms in the battleground state, when several key races will be decided including a critical U.S. Senate seat.",
      "After a tumultuous few years for the party defined by infighting, here is what's at stake.",
      "Three Republicans are asking party delegates for their votes.",
      "The most well-known candidate is Meshawn Maddock, a MAGA activist, close ally to President Donald Trump and former party co-chair. Maddock faces eight forgery and conspiracy charges in an alleged false elector case stemming from the 2020 election.",
      "Maddock refuted the charges, saying the prosecution is politically motivated and she believes the charges will be dropped.",

      "Rounding out the choices is Joseph Cella, a former Trump ambassador to Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu.",
      "Fifteen Republicans are accused of participating in a plan to falsely claim to be presidential electors for Trump in the 2020 election, despite Joe Biden's victory in Michigan that year. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, dropped charges against a 16th defendant after reaching a cooperation deal.",
      "The defendants have denied their actions were illegal. Each were criminally charged with eight counts of forgery and conspiracy in the case alleging the group signed a document during a December 2020 meeting at the Michigan Republican headquarters falsely stating they were the state\u2019s \u201cduly elected and qualified electors.\u201d The fake certificates were ignored.",
      "Biden won Michigan by nearly 155,000 votes over then-President Donald Trump in 2020, a result confirmed by a GOP-led state Senate investigation in 2021.",
      "Maddock and the other defendants are currently waiting for a county district judge to decide if there is enough evidence for the case to proceed to trial. The next court date is scheduled for March 28, about a month after the GOP convention.",

      "Additionally, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term limited and names are lining up to replace her. Control of the state House of Representatives and Senate are on the line, as well as the offices of attorney general, secretary of state and two state Supreme Court seats.",
      "Whoever Republicans choose will take over a party still recovering from a chaotic period defined by infighting and financial woes that started with a convention vote. A grassroots revolution in 2023 ushered in party chair Kristiana Karamo, a political newcomer who denied the results of the 2020 election.",
      "Party finances tanked under her tenure, eventually forcing some Michigan Republicans, national Republicans and Trump himself to replace her with former congressman and ambassador Pete Hoekstra. Hoekstra is not seeking the position again as Trump has nominated him to serve as ambassador to Canada.",
      "Across town, Democrats also are picking their next party chair Saturday.",
      "Former state lawmaker and congressional candidate Curtis Hertel Jr. is expected to be selected for the role. Hertel unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House in the 2024 election, losing to former state lawmaker and Army veteran Tom Barrett by nearly 4 percentage points."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:11:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A number of bill rises will come into force at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
    "story": [
      "Energy costs are one of a number of bill rises which will come into force at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances, and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages will increase from April, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are due to go up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming in April.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are set to rise by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water, with the system funded by the devolved government.",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will go up \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",
      "Ofgem is suggesting households consider a fixed tariff for a bit of stability, even though there's speculation of prices dropping in July.",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority will go up from April.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are expected to go up in April, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",
      "Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland's councils have reported district rate increases for the next year.",
      "4. Car tax",
      "From April, the standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 rises \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, based on the inflation rate last December, plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence will also go up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV it will go up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000 in April, instead of over \u00a3250,000 at the moment.",
      "First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this will drop to \u00a3300,000.",
      "Anyone starting a search for a property now would likely struggle to move before the stamp duty changes.",
      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "According to figures from the government's financial watchdog by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate - due to the threshold being frozen.",

      "The cap, which is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Ofgem said switching to a fixed tariff provided certainty over payments and could reduce costs, although analysts predict prices could fall in July.",
      "The seven bills due to go up in April",
      "The rise in April will hit people's finances at the same time as water and council tax increases, although average wages are also going up.",
      "The regulator said rising wholesale costs and inflation were behind the latest energy price hike - the third consecutive increase in the quarterly cap and more than the 5% analysts had forecast.",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not, so bills will vary depending on how much energy is used.",
      "Ofgem illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity. Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region will see an overall increase of up to \u00a320 a year.",
      "Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley accepted another increase in energy costs was \"unwelcome\".",
      "He said customers, where possible, should consider \"switching or fixing tariffs now\" to try to lower costs and \"provide certainty over coming payments\".",
      "According to Ofgem, about four million households have fixed in recent months.",
      "Some people in debt to their supplier will not be able to switch firms, but should still be able to fix with their current provider on their best fixed deal.",
      "Anyone worried about paying their bills should contact their supplier for help, Mr Brearley added.",
      "Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, told the BBC that moving to a fixed deal was a \"no-brainer\".",
      "He said people should check whole-of-market comparison sites for the best deal, and wait a little while before choosing a new tariff as he has heard some \"good tariffs are being launched\" by energy firms.",
      "However, analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have forecast variable prices could fall again in July to close to the current level.",

      "\"We're helping people every day who simply can't afford this latest price hike,\" said its chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty.",
      "The government has announced it is planning to extend the number of people who qualify for the Warm Home Discount scheme next winter - which gives some people on benefits a reduction of \u00a3150 from their annual energy bill.",
      "Energy bills are about 50% higher than pre-Covid levels, but remain below the peak reached in 2022 when Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused prices to spike.",
      "Ofgem director general of markets, Tim Jarvis, said the latest price rises were driven by international gas prices, which have gone up \"significantly\" recently.",
      "However, analysts at Cornwall Insight said energy prices have dipped in the past couple of weeks following US-Russia talks on a potential end to the Ukraine war.",
      "As a result, the consultancy has forecast the price cap in July will fall to \u00a31,756 a year for a typical consumer, although it noted this would still be hundreds of pounds above the pre-conflict level.",

      "\"If \u2013 and it is still very much an if \u2013 the forecast moves against the chancellor, she'll face a truly unenviable set of choices, none of which are made easier by the upwards pressures on defence spending,\" she said, referring to the uncertainty over the outcome of the war in Ukraine.",

      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "Follow live updates",
      "The idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.",
      "On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.",
      "Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",

      "However, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.",
      "Zelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:11:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The largest producer of maple syrup now wants you to drink the sap, which it calls maple water.",
    "story": [
      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He founded the company back in 2013 with business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

      "Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the country's politics, Georgia's parliament rushed through amendments to the nation's tax code.",
      "Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change \u2013 which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia \u2013 may have been introduced to serve the interests of the country's richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili.",
      "He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "\"Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,\" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze.",
      "With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies.",
      "Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\".",
      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police.",
      "In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year.",
      "There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili.",
      "The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\".",
      "TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands.",
      "\"All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories,\" says Beso Namchavadze.",

      "\"For everybody who knows him it's pretty clear that this is something that he values the most out of all the assets, and all the wealth, that he has,\" says Tina Khidasheli, Georgia's ex-defence minister and the head of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea.",

      "The head of Georgia's parliamentary committee on finance and budget, Paata Kvijinadze, recently defended the tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia.",
      "\"If anyone benefited from this law, I am happy about it,\" he said in a post on social media. \"This is exactly what the law was meant to be: to bring companies from offshore zones and attract more investments into the country\".",
      "In response to the proposed UK sanctions, Georgia's ruling party issued a statement defending Mr Ivanishvili, saying that a threat of sanctions was \"without any foundation\" against the party founder who brought \"democratic breakthrough to the country\".",
      "Separately, Mr Ivanishvili's lawyer announced last month that his client is suing Swiss bank Julius Baer for, among other reasons, misinterpreting \"the so-called\" American sanctions, which the lawyer described as \"political blackmail\".",
      "The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members.",
      "For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money.",
      "Some believe that the billionaire's mistrust of the West and increased use of conspiracy theories at home, such as accusing adversaries of being part of the \"global war party\", or \"deep state\", originate in his long-standing financial grievances.",
      "Ever since he became convinced that Credit Suisse was part of a grand conspiracy against him, says Tina Khdasheli. \"Bidzina Ivanishvili held Georgia hostage to his personal financial issues.\"",
      "Experts say that even though Mr Ivanishvili's current official position is the honorary chairman of the ruling party, there is a clear understanding that he remains the number one person in Georgian politics. Sanctions against him are therefore seen as sanctions against the entire government.",

      "Mr Gilauri says that Georgia's continuing political instability and international isolation is negatively impacting the economy. \"We are seeing a very negative effect on FDI, foreign direct investment, if you take nine months of 2024 compared to nine months of 2023, we have a 40% drop. So going forward this is going to continue to get worse.\"",

      "Mr Gilauri of Reformatics says their own analysis shows that Georgia's economic growth this year will be zero.",
      "\"Going forward, we will have a budgetary problem, a currency exchange problem. We will have an inflation problem. We will have a jobs problem, a job creation problem, and we will have economic decline problem.",

    "summary": "Members of the University and College Union are taking industrial action over potential job cuts",
    "story": [
      "Staff at Dundee University have begun three weeks of strike action over the institution's plans to cut jobs due to a potential \u00a330m deficit.",
      "The University and College Union (UCU) Scotland said that 74% of its members had backed strike action, on a turnout of 64%.",
      "More than 450 UCU members, comprising academic and support staff, will strike each weekday for the next three weeks. It is expected lectures and classes will be cancelled.",
      "Dundee University said the action was \"premature\" and had been voted for by less than 10% of the university's staff.",
      "The university currently employs more than 3,000 people.",
      "Former principal Prof Iain Gillespie told staff in November that job losses were \"inevitable\" and blamed \"an extremely challenging period\" for the UK higher education sector.",
      "Prof Gillespie resigned a month later after the university defended a \u00a37,000 business trip he took to Hong Kong with a colleague.",
      "Amanda Millar, the university's court chairwoman, resigned with immediate effect last week.",
      "Senior lecturer and local UCU branch co-president Dr Melissa D'Ascenzio said: \"We are striking against the threat of compulsory redundancies.",
      "\"What is clear to us is that the deficit has not been caused by staff costs.",
      "\"We were told for months in 2024 that we were doing really well, that the University of Dundee was doing better than other Scottish universities.",
      "\"Then suddenly in November there was this change in the financial position and we were told we had this big deficit.",
      "\"If we don't really know what has caused this financial crisis, then cutting staff is not the answer.\"",
      "The university's interim principal Prof Shane O'Neill told BBC Scotland News that he was \"very disappointed\" at the strike action.",
      "He said: \"While we're aware we have significant financial problems to address, and we haven't hidden from the fact that inevitably that will lead to some job losses, we've not shared the detail of the plan yet.",
      "\"The issue for them (UCU) is that we can't rule out compulsory redundancies and we've acknowledged that.",
      "\"But I very much put it to them that it's really disappointing because it does seem premature, and also I'm not clear who's gaining anything from it.\"",
      "A rally and public meeting was held on Monday lunchtime in Dundee city centre, with speakers including trades union leaders and local politicians.",
      "A three-week ballot of members of the Unison trade union - which represents present professional services staff at the university - on strike action will begin on Tuesday.",
      "Dundee University's court will meet on the same day to discuss the financial situation, but any details of a recovery plan will not be announced until early next month."

      "This includes a 26-storey student housing block in Anderston, which could accommodate 410 students.",
      "A 36-floor student flat development near Charing Cross, housing 784 students, is also under construction.",
      "This will be Glasgow's second tallest building, after the Glasgow Science Centre's Tower.",
      "Developers Watkin Jones said the property, which will be called the Ard, will address a \"chronic undersupply\" of student accommodation and free up homes more appropriate for families.",
      "However, city centre residents have complained about the amount of student flats being built in the area.",
      "In November 2024, a 19 storey student flat was given the green light despite 60 objections from neighbours who claimed that the proposed building was excessive and that there were too many student flats in the city centre already.",
      "A report submitted in support of the application stated that Glasgow was facing a \"major supply shortage\" of student accommodation.",
      "Prof James White, a planning and urban design professor at Glasgow University, said that the new flats would bring \"broadly positive benefits\" to the city centre.",
      "He said: \"A lot of the student developments are on the periphery of Glasgow city centre, where the residential population is relatively low.",
      "\"These developments bring young people and commerce to these areas, so I think, in a sense, it's positive for the neighbourhoods.\"",
      "In 2019, Glasgow City Council launched their city centre living strategy, which aims to boost the city centre population to 40,000 by 2035.",
      "Prof White said that while these student developments addressed a current need for more accommodation, he is concerned about their longevity if the market for student housing drops.",
      "\"Being wholly reliant on students is problematic from a sustainability perspective,\" he said.",
      "\"We need a mix of different housing in the city centre - right now, its skewed towards students and how easy will it be to change those buildings in the future?",
      "\"If we're not also building parks and schools, if we do need to change the use of these buildings later, it will be hard for families to move in as they won't have the facilities they need.\"",

      "The BBC board has apologised over \"missed opportunities\" to tackle \"bullying and misogynistic behaviour\" by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood.",
      "An independent report into what the BBC knew about Mr Westwood's conduct was published on Tuesday, highlighting a series of incidents and allegations it said amount to a \"considerable body of evidence\" which it failed to investigate properly.",
      "The report added the BBC had \"inadequate record keeping and communication with people who raised complaints or concerns\", and \"an insufficiently rigorous attempt to address the substance of concerns raised\".",
      "The BBC had previously acknowledged six complaints about bullying and sexual misconduct. In a video that appeared on social media last year, the DJ said: \"It's all false allegations.\"",
      "The BBC board admitted it did not \"take adequate action\", saying: \"It is clear that in the past, the BBC has not only been too siloed but too deferential to high-profile individuals.\"",
      "\"The board also wants to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of the entire BBC to anyone impacted by what the review has found,\" it added.",

      "The DJ's solicitors told Ms White:",
      "He denies the allegations of criminal and other misconduct and \"confirms he has never had any sexual interest in children under the age of 16\". He has never acted in a \"predatory and/or sexual manner\" and \"did not (and does not) present any risk to young women, at the BBC nor elsewhere\".

      "But the \"lack of formality adopted\" towards concerns raised about workplace misconduct, and the \"type of material broadcast on air\" were likely to have resulted employees not feeling confident that workplace conduct concerns about the DJ \"would be properly addressed.\"",
      "The BBC board said: \"Beyond assessing any alleged criminality, which is a matter for the police, it is clear there were times where the BBC, on learning about concerns regarding Mr Westwood's behaviour, did not take adequate action.\"",
      "It cited \"evidence of bullying and misogynistic behaviour on the part of Mr Westwood and the plain fact is that his general conduct was entirely incompatible with BBC values \u2013 not just now, but then\".",
      "\"The organisation fell short and failed people \u2013 including our own staff \u2013 who had a right to expect better from us,\" it added.",
      "The report has cost approximately \u00a33.3m.",
      "It found \"there was no widespread or significant or BBC knowledge of allegations or concerns about predatory sexual behaviour by Mr Westwood\".",

      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",

      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",

      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",

      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",

      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for best actor, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",

      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 musicians - including Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush - released a silent album on Tuesday in protest at the UK government's planned changes to copyright law, which they say would make it easier for AI companies to train models using copyrighted work without a licence.",
      "Under the new proposals, AI developers will be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\".",
      "The artists hope the album, entitled Is This What We Want?, will draw attention to the potential impact on livelihoods and the UK music industry.",
      "All profits will be donated to the charity Help Musicians.",
      "\"In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?\" Kate Bush said in a statement.",
      "A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday.",
      "The album - also backed by the likes of Billy Ocean, Ed O'Brien of Radiohead and Bastille's Dan Smith, as well as The Clash, Mystery Jets and Jamiroquai - features sound recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, demonstrating what the artists fear is the potential impact of the proposed law change.",
      "The tracklisting for the record simply spells out the message: \"The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies.\"",
      "The government is currently consulting on proposals that would allow AI companies to use material that is available online without respecting copyright if they are using it for text or data mining.",
      "Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human.",
      "The proposals would give artists or creators a so-called \"rights reservation\" \u2013 the ability to opt out.",
      "But critics of the plan believe it is not possible for an individual writer or artist to notify thousands of different AI service providers that they do not want their content used in that way, or to monitor what has happened to their work across the whole internet.",
      "A spokesman for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said in a statement on Tuesday that the UK's \"current regime for copyright and AI is holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue\".",
      "\"That's why we have been consulting on a new approach that protects the interests of both AI developers and right holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive.",
      "\"We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so.\"",
      "They added that \"no decisions have been taken\" and \"no moves will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives.\"",

      "Imogen Heap, Yusuf aka Cat Stevens and Riz Ahmed have also backed the silent album release as well as Tori Amos and Hans Zimmer.",
      "Composer Max Richter, another of the artists involved in the album, noted how the plans not only have an impact on musicians but \"impoverish creators\" across the board, from writers to visual artists and beyond.",
      "In 2023, UK music contributed a record \u00a37.6 billion to the economy.",
      "Organiser of the silent record, Ed Newton-Rex, said the proposals were not only \"disastrous for musicians\" in the UK but also \"totally unnecessary\", as the country can be \"leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus\".",
      "He said the new record showed that \"however the government tries to justify it, musicians themselves are united in their thorough condemnation of this ill-thought-through plan.\"",
      "Singer-songwriter Naomi Kimpenu added: \"We cannot be abandoned by the government and have our work stolen for the profit of big tech.\"",
      "She said the plans would \"shatter the prospects of so many emerging artists in the UK\".",

      "There is evidence Rwanda has sent 4,000 troops across the border to support the rebels.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of civilians are now destitute having fled their homes, and shocking violence, including the rape of children, has skyrocketed.",

      "But Legend defended his decision to headline the Move Afrika event in Kigali, which was run by the Global Citizen NGO and attracted thousands of fans from across the continent.",
      "He said he was not being paid for the performance but felt it was his duty to help \"grow touring capabilities\" on the African continent, which is often overlooked by international stars on so-called world tours.",
      "\"I'm aware of what's happening [in DR Congo] and I'm aware of the calls there have been for me to not do this show, but I really believe that the mission of Move Afrika is still important,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Delighted fans at the sold-out show agreed, but the social media backlash was ferocious enough to force Legend to delete an Instagram post he had made promoting the event.",
      "Belgium-based activist Denise Zanesa had argued that \"performing under the banner\" of Rwanda \"would be akin to collaborating with oppression itself\", in a message posted to X (formerly Twitter).",
      "It was a sentiment echoed by others, including Simone Umba in the US, who wrote in a TikTok video caption: \"So are we ready to talk about Rwanda's use of Black American culture in their soft campaigning to normalise their terrorising of eastern Congo?\"",
      "Taking a political stance would have been nothing new for the star.",
      "Legend is outspoken in his criticism of US President Donald Trump. He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign to \"siphon\" black people's votes away from the Democrats.",
      "The debate over Rwanda's relationship with popular global figures is also not new.",
      "Most recently, Rwanda has been accused of \"sportswashing\" - with critics saying it uses the feel-good factor of international football to cover up alleged human rights abuses at home.",
      "The East African nation is said to receive $1bn (\u00a3800m) a year in foreign aid and its tourism arm - Visit Rwanda - has lucrative sponsorship deals with Arsenal in England, Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris St-Germain in France.",

      "\"I love acting, we get to open people's minds to new ideas, take them beyond what they understand of the world, and help them laugh when things are rough,\" she said.",
      "\"And for a woman like me, who grew up in the 40s and 50s when women weren't supposed to have opinions and get angry, acting gave me a chance to play angry women with opinions, which as you know is a stretch for me,\" she joked.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in unions, they have our backs, they bring us into community, and they give us power. This is really important right now when workers' power is being attacked and community is being weakened.\"",
      "In an impassioned speech which indirectly referenced political turmoil, Fonda concluded: \"We mustn't kid ourselves about what is happening.",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 15:37:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Daniel Craig's replacement will be Amazon's biggest decision after gaining control of the franchise.",
    "story": [
      "\"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\"",
      "That was the question posed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos this week to his 6.8 million followers on X.",
      "It is Bezos who will now have the final say on the next 007. He asked for suggestions alongside a screenshot of the BBC News story about his company gaining creative control of the famous spy film franchise.",
      "The choice of Daniel Craig's replacement will now be Amazon MGM Studios' biggest decision.",
      "So let's take a look at what direction the company could take, and who is in the frame.",
      "If the replies to Bezos's call out are anything to go by, Henry Cavill is the (online) people's choice.",
      "The former Superman actor, who has said he \"would love to play Bond\", was widely regarded to have been the runner-up years ago when Craig landed the part for the first of his five 007 films, 2006's Casino Royale.",
      "The movie's director Martin Campbell told the Express last year that Cavill's audition was \"tremendous\" and that \"if Daniel didn't exist, Henry would have made an excellent Bond\".",
      "There was just one problem. \"He just looked a little young at that time back then,\" added Campbell.",
      "Longstanding Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who announced on Thursday they were stepping down, have previously shot down the idea of a younger Bond.",
      "\"Remember, Bond's already a veteran,\" Wilson said in 2022. \"He's had some experience. He's a person who has been through the wars, so to speak. He's probably been in the SAS or something.\"",
      "Amazon may have different ideas - but at 41, Cavill could ironically now be considered too old, especially if he stays for a string of subsequent movies.",
      "The next most frequently mentioned names in the replies to Bezos were Tom Hardy, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Idris Elba.",
      "Taylor-Johnson, 34, known for roles in Kick-Ass and Kraven the Hunter, was at one stage rumoured to have been offered the job, but no announcement ever materialised.",
      "Kraven bombed at the box office last year, though, which could count against him.",
      "The bookmakers had Happy Valley actor James Norton listed as their favourite on Friday.",
      "Speaking on the red carpet at last weekend's Bafta Awards, Norton, 39, described the speculation around him becoming Bond as \"so weird and bemusing\" yet \"fun\".",
      "'Bring it younger'",
      "Mark O'Connell, author of Catching Bullets: Memoirs of a Bond Fan, told the BBC he thinks Amazon - and whoever they choose as the next director - will go for a younger actor than in previous times, and he hopes they buy British again.",
      "\"Tom Hardy would be great, [but] I think he's, dare I say, too old,\" he said of the 47-year-old Mad Max actor.",
      "\"There's a lot of guys that keep getting quoted [and] I'm like, they're too old.",
      "\"I think Amazon's going to bring it younger. I think we're looking at early 30s. Paul Mescal is a good name. Kingsley Ben-Adir, who's one of the Kens in the Barbie movie, I'd keep an eye on him - he's got a sort of [Sean] Connery swagger about him.",
      "\"Harris Dickinson, who's a British actor doing well in Babygirl with Nicole Kidman at the moment, he's very British,\" O'Connell added.",
      "\"I hope they stick with the British DNA and origins of the role. I think they would be foolish to move away from that. But time will tell.\"",
      "Bond has been played by two non-British actors in the past - Australian George Lazenby and Irishman Pierce Brosnan. So don't rule out the likes of fellow Irish stars Mescal, Oscar winner Cillian Murphy, Aidan Turner, or Aussie Jacob Elordi.",
      "Could Amazon break the mould and go for the first American Bond? If so, Austin Butler has been mooted.",
      "Other Brits who have been shaken but not stirred into the mix include Challengers star Josh O'Connor, 34, and Babylon's Stuart Martin, 39, as well as White Lotus actor Theo James, who is 40.",
      "Callum Turner, Richard Madden, Will Poulter and Nicholas Hoult have also been suggested, among others.",
      "'Teasing Bond's masculine ego'",
      "Since Bond - originally the creation of author Ian Fleming - hit the big screen in 1962, first played by Scotsman Sean Connery, his hair and eye colour have changed, not to mention his accent.",
      "But so far, the character's skin colour and gender have remained fixed.",
      "That is apart from when Lashana Lynch briefly took over the 007 title from Craig's Bond in No Time to Die.",
      "\"James Bond can be of any colour, but he is male,\" Broccoli said in 2020.",
      "\"I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.\"",
      "She added: \"He should be British, so British can be any [ethnicity].\"",
      "Bridgerton actor Rege-Jean Page has been mooted alongside Ben-Adir as a possible first non-white Bond, as have Lucien Laviscount, Paapa Essiedu, Damson Idris, Riz Ahmed and Aaron Pierre.",
      "If Bezos does break Broccoli's rule and go for a woman, Cynthia Erivo would be a popular choice.",
      "However, Idris Elba, 52, the star of The Wire and Luther, said in 2023 that the racist backlash to the prospect of him being Bond \"made the whole thing disgusting and off-putting\".",
      "It's not just the lead role that the Amazon casting department will have to think about.",
      "\"In terms of what they could do with the women, I would love to see more interesting and nuanced female characters,\" said Monica German\u00e0, author of Bond Girls: Body, Fashion and Gender.",
      "\"There is a growing female fandom, so we want more interesting female characters teasing Bond's masculine ego.\"",
      "Then there are the villains, who are the characters with their \"pulse on the real world\", German\u00e0 said.",
      "\"They represent the anxieties we have about the world. So it'd be interesting what Amazon does with that. Will the next villain be, I don't know, will it be AI? Will it be something to do with climate change? Will it be far-right politics that they tap into?\"",
      "'Rediscover the fun'",
      "Debating the next James Bond is \"a national and international obsession\", BBC Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"I want to have an answer for you. I want to say names like Harris Dickinson or Leo Woodall and say, yes, it's going to be them. But it's all up in the air.\"",
      "Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine and podcast told BBC Radio 5 Live that while he \"admired what Craig has achieved\", he wants the new management \"to rediscover the fun of Bond\".",
      "Bond fan and author Ajay Chowdhury added: \"I think Bond ultimately is fantasy and it's fun and I think that entertainment value could be brought back.\"",
      "Bond bosses have often alternated between serious and lighter-hearted lead actors, he said.",
      "\"They always tend to reboot. You have a serious Bond [like Timothy] Dalton followed by a lighter Bond, Brosnan. Serious, Craig - and I think it's time to do that again.\"",
      "Chowdhury thinks the new Bond will be \"an established British actor\" with what he calls \"the Goldilocks amount of fame\" - not too hot, not too cold.",
      "\"They'll have done TV and theatre across the Atlantic, but they won't be stars,\" he offers.",
      "\"They'll have just the right amount of fame and they'll be young enough to do three or four [films].",

      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new joint venture that will see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",
      "In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.",
      "The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans.",
      "\"I'm in two minds,\" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed.",
      "\"That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.",
      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",

      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",

      "Amanda Pritchard, the first female chief executive of the NHS in England, is stepping down from the role.",
      "In a statement Ms Pritchard said it had been a \"hugely difficult decision for me to stand down\".",
      "\"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.\"",
      "She took up the post in 2021 and played a central role in the official response to the Covid pandemic.",
      "Before that, she was NHS England's chief operating officer, head of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust in London and an adviser in Tony Blair's government.",
      "Her departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service.",
      "As to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant.",
      "She noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership.",
      "Sources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein.",
      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",
      "\"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\".",
      "A government source indicated NHS England would in due course be a smaller organisation as some powers were devolved to regional health boards.",
      "The reality is that whoever is appointed, the government faces huge challenges cutting waiting lists for operations and treatments, and reducing long waits in emergency departments.",
      "'Turbulent waters'",
      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.",
      "Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.",
      "MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.",
      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",
      "NHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April.",
      "Her successor, Sir James, said he was honoured to be leading the health service through the next phase \"as we radically reshape the role of NHS England and work with the government to build an NHS that is fit for the future through the 10-year health plan\".",
      "Sir James, a highly experienced NHS trust boss, will be known as transition chief executive with no time limit set on how long he will serve. It's understood that no appointment process has been set up to look for a replacement for Ms Pritchard."

      "An artificial-intelligence tool can detect two-thirds of epilepsy brain lesions doctors often miss, say the UK researchers who have developed it, paving the way for more targeted surgery to stop seizures.",
      "One out of every five people with epilepsy - a total of 30,000 in the UK - has uncontrolled seizures caused by brain abnormalities too subtle for the human eye to see on scans.",
      "Child epilepsy experts say the AI tool has \"huge potential\" and opens up avenues for treatment.",
      "But more studies on the long-term benefits for patients are needed before it can be licensed and used in clinics.",
      "Brain abnormalities called focal cortical dysplasia are a common cause of epilepsy, especially when medication cannot control seizures.",

      "Removing a small part of the brain can be a safe and effective way of stopping them - but if radiologists cannot see the tiny lesions on brain scans, diagnosis, treatment and surgery can be delayed.",
      "'Really difficult'",
      "For this study, published in JAMA Neurology, the researchers, from King's College London and University College London, fed their tool magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) scans from more than 1,185 adults and children at 23 hospitals around the world, 703 of whom had brain abnormalities.",
      "The tool, MELD Graph, was able to process the images more quickly than a doctor could - and in more detail - which could mean more timely treatment and fewer  costly tests and procedures, lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl said.",
      "The AI would require human oversight, however, and many of the abnormalities were still missed.",
      "\"It's like finding one character on five pages of solid black text,\"  Dr Wagstyl said.",
      "\"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\"",

      "Study co-author and childhood epilepsy consultant Prof Helen Cross said it had the potential \"to rapidly identify abnormalities that can be removed and potentially cure the epilepsy\".",
      "Uncontrolled epilepsy was \"incapacitating\", she said.",
      "Many of the children she sees as a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital have had years of seizures and investigations before a lesion is found.",
      "Charity Epilepsy Action said the new AI tool's potential was \"really exciting\" and could give people faster diagnosis, but did not solve the issue of lack of specialist epilepsy nurses in England.",
      "\"It remains early days and, as always, we must proceed with caution,\" said Ley Sander from the Epilepsy Society, adding that if the tool could identify more people as candidates for brain surgery, that could be \"life-changing for many more people with epilepsy\".",
      "The researchers are hoping for official approval to use MELD Graph as a diagnostic tool - but other trials are needed first to investigate the long-term benefits for patients whose brain lesions are detected.",

    "story": [
      "An experimental trial of gene therapy has helped four toddlers - born with one of the most severe forms of childhood blindness - gain \"life-changing improvements\" to their sight, according to doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.",
      "The rare genetic condition means the babies' vision deteriorated very rapidly from birth.",
      "Before the therapy, they were registered legally blind and only just able to distinguish between dark and light. After the infusion, all parents reported improvements - with some of their young children now able to begin to draw and write.",
      "Further work is being done to confirm the early study, which appears in the Lancet medical journal.",
      "Gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness has been available on the NHS since 2020.",
      "The new work builds on that success by injecting healthy copies of a defective gene into the back of a child's eye, very early in life, to treat a severe form of the condition.",
      "Jace, from Connecticut in the United States, had the gene therapy in London when he was just two years old.",
      "As a young baby, his parents noticed something wasn't right about his eyesight.",
      "\"Around eight weeks old when babies should start looking at you and smiling, Jace wasn't doing that yet,\" says his mum DJ.",
      "She knew instinctively there was an issue and began to search for the reason, which took 10 months.",
      "After several visits to doctors and many tests, the family were told Jace had the ultra rare condition. It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.",
      "\"It was a shock,\" Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child.",
      "\"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward.\"",
      "The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.",
      "Jace's surgery was quick and \"pretty easy\", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.",
      "These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.",
      "In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.",
      "His son's progress has been \"pretty amazing\", he says.",
      "\"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.",
      "\"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before.\"",
      "This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.",
      "\"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision,\" Brendan says.",
      "No other options",
      "Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people.",
      "\"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development.",
      "\"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected,\" he said.",
      "The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.",
      "Scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye, and Great Ormond Street Hospital specialists led on giving the procedure in the trial.",
      "Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available.",
      "Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects.",
      "They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors.",
      "Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging.",
      "'Hugely impressive'",
      "According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give \"compelling evidence\" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.",
      "Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected.",
      "Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: \"The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives.\"",
      "The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.",
      "The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the \"greatest benefit\" and ultimately transform children's lives.",

      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",

      "Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice",
      "Ketamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.",
      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

      "Speaking during a key week for international diplomacy, she also called for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to boost defence spending by pulling funds from development aid, welfare and scrapping the Chagos deal.",

      "Responding to journalists' questions after her speech at an event hosted by the Policy Exchange think tank, Badenoch said: \"I have always been very clear that the ECHR should not stop us doing what is right for the people of this country and what is in our national interest, and if it continues to do so at some point we will probably have to leave.",
      "\"What I have not agreed with is deciding we should leave without having a plan for what that looks like and how to do so in a way that makes sense.\"",
      "Setting out how rules were critical for a trading nation like the UK, she added: \"But other countries are breaking the rules and we need to get serious about that and not pretend that those things aren't happening and that's really what I want us to focus on.\"",
      "Badenoch was speaking the day after a series of international events to mark the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump has demanded Nato allies raise defence spending to 5% of GDP and opened talks with Russia, excluding Ukraine, on ending Putin's war.",
      "Meanwhile, there has been a deepening rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with the US President falsely suggesting Ukraine started the war and branding Zelensky a \"dictator\".",
      "Badenoch urged the PM to go further than her party's previous pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030, saying this was \"no longer sufficient\".",
      "She said cutting international aid could take that total to 3%, and called on the government to find further savings on the welfare bill, as well as by ditching the multi-billion pound Chagos deal.",
      "\"There will be painful decisions on government spending,\" she said.",
      "\"Any country that spends more interest on its debt than on defence, as the UK does today, is destined for weakness.\"",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir will visit the White House and signal a shift in the government's approach to bringing about peace, including stepping up UK military support and taking a bigger role in Europe's security.",
      "Sir Keir will be making the case for Ukraine's direct involvement in any peace talks, warning that an insecure settlement without security guarantees for Kyiv could embolden Russia to attack again.",
      "Badenoch raised her concerns that the world may be seeing \"a return to the world of the strong and the weak\" with the threat from \"a new axis of authoritarian powers\" including Russia, China and Iran.",
      "On Trump's negotiations with Putin, she said: \"The danger is that aggression does not simply go unpunished but ends up being rewarded.\"",
      "She also reiterated her position that international courts are being used by charities and other organisations \"to advance an activist political agenda\".",
      "The ECHR was established in 1950 and sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries.",
      "The treaty is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants who are deemed to be in the UK illegally.",
      "The treaty was also recently cited in a case that allowed a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK, after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians.",
      "During the Conservative leadership election, Badenoch said leaving the treaty would not be a \"silver bullet\" to tackling immigration but last week said her party would review the ECHR and Human Rights Act.",

    "story": [
      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",
      "As farmers outside the conference centre sounded their tractor horns, he announced measures including extending the seasonal worker visa scheme for five years, support for precision breeding and new technology.",
      "He also announced new requirements for government catering contracts to favour \"high quality, high welfare products that British producers are well placed to meet\".",
      "Earlier in the day, a multi-generational farming family - Martin Towler, his daughter and son-in-law, Hazel and Tom Church, and their five-year-old son Bertie - went to the Treasury to handover a collection of pre-loved farming toys donated by farmers who might be hit by the government's proposed changes to agricultural inheritance tax.",
      "The family have been farming Scald End Farm, a mixed beef and sheep farm in north Bedfordshire, since the 1940s but they all now also have to work off farm to supplement their income.",
      "They say the impact of the proposed inheritance tax changes will leave them facing a \u00a3400,000 bill and the prospect of selling off so much of the 210-acre farm that it would become unviable as a business.",
      "Mr Church said he hoped the government would listen to farmers' concerns and try to find a compromise on its inheritance tax policy.",
      "He told the BBC the changes, as currently proposed, would have a \"detrimental\" impact on the family's ability to run a profitable business.",
      "\"We are struggling at the moment as it is. There's no two ways about that,\" he said.",
      "\"Farming is incredibly low return on investment when you look at the asset values of the land and the income generated.",
      "\"If we are saddled with further debt through death - is it viable? Selling land is going to make it even less viable.\"",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins has said the Conservatives would reverse the inheritance tax on farmers \"straight away\".",
      "During Tuesday's conference in Westminster - the first time it has been held outside Birmingham for years - Reed, took questions from the audience.",
      "There was clear anger among those questioning him on the tax changes and he was told many older farmers \"were wishing their lives away\" and now felt they would benefit their families by dying before the 2026 tax change.",

      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",

      "'Turbulent waters'",
      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.",
      "Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.",
      "MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.",
      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",

    "story": [
      "Campaigners have threatened the government with legal action unless it reconsiders the decision to refuse compensation to millions of women affected by an increase in the state pension age.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group is demanding payouts for 3.6 million women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of changes first introduced in the 1990s.",
      "The government apologised that the changes were not communicated quickly enough but told the BBC it \"cannot justify paying for a \u00a310.5bn compensation scheme at the expense of the taxpayer\".",
      "Waspi chair Angela Madden said: \"We believe this is not only an outrage but legally wrong.\"",
      "The \"letter before action\" that has been sent to the government is a formal mechanism to allow it a chance to respond before the campaigners seek a judicial review at the High Court in two weeks time.",
      "Last year the parliamentary ombudsman recommended payouts of up to \u00a32,950 each because of a 28-month\u00a0delay\u00a0in\u00a0writing\u00a0to\u00a0inform\u00a0the women affected of the changes.",

      "What is the row about women's pensions?",
      "'I want the \u00a345,000 state pension that was stolen from me'",
      "Ms Madden said: \"We will not allow the DWP's gaslighting of Waspi women to go unchallenged.",
      "\"The government has accepted that 1950s-born women are victims of maladministration, but it now says none of us suffered any injustice.\"",
      "With no compensation forthcoming she said: \"The alternative is continued defence of the indefensible but this time in front of a judge.\"",
      "The Waspi group has also launched a crowd-funding campaign to try to cover an estimated \u00a375,000 in legal fees.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:53:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Bridget Phillipson says the US thawing diplomatic ties with Putin \"brought Russians to the table\".",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump was right to re-establish links with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to set up peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, a senior Labour minister has said.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there could be \"no negotiated peace without Russia\" and that Trump's approach had brought \"Russians to the table\".",
      "The US president has faced a backlash for excluding Ukraine from talks after his aides met Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. Trump has also suggested Ukraine may be a bystander, saying it has \"no cards\" in the deal.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will meet Trump in Washington this week and press for Ukraine to be \"at the heart\" of any peace talks.",
      "Ukraine hit by largest single Russian drone attack of war on eve of third anniversary",
      "Rosenberg: How Putin and Trump shook up the world in a week",
      "I'll back Ukraine in talks with Trump, Starmer says",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson said that Trump thawing diplomatic ties with Russia and Putin was \"the right approach\".",
      "\"President Trump has brought the Russians to the table,\" she added.",
      "When asked by Kuenssberg if welcoming Putin back was the right move, Phillipson said, \"absolutely\".",
      "\"There can be no settlement, no negotiated peace, without Russia,\" she said.",
      "She added \"any lasting settlement where it comes to peace does require Ukrainian voices, President Zelensky's voice to be a central part of that.",
      "\"There can be no settlement unless we have a negotiation involving both Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"We are however, also clear of the risk that Russian President Putin poses to our interest.\"",
      "Shortly after coming to office, Trump held a phone call with Putin in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. It was the first phone-call to Putin by a US president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "It was a significant thawing of the US relationship with Russia. Trump's predecessor Joe Biden previously called Putin a \"murderous dictator\" and a \"pure thug\".",
      "Since the call Trump has claimed Putin wants to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine - arguing Russia did not necessarily have to negotiate a ceasefire, because it could take \"the whole country\" by force.",
      "Trump has instead turned on Zelensky in recent days, calling him a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming he was doing a \"terrible job\" and falsely suggesting he was the one who started the war with Russia.",
      "Trump's short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less US involvement, given that the country has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv.",
      "The White House is pushing Ukraine to sign a $500bn (\u00a3395bn) minerals deal, which would give the US control over half of Ukraine's mineral resources - which the Trump administration describes this as \"payback\" for earlier US military assistance.",
      "The Ukrainian president had rejected the initial US proposal made several days ago, saying he \"cannot sell our state\".",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 08:04:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Last week the Isle of Man came very close to axing a policy no UK politician dares touch.",
    "story": [
      "A pensions timebomb is ticking on the Isle of Man and the self-governing island off the UK's west coast came very close to defusing it last week.",
      "Like the UK, the island protects state pensions with the triple lock, which automatically increases the state pension each year by the maximum of three measures: price inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "The Isle of Man's government wanted to scrap the triple lock for some pensioners in its budget last week.",
      "But ministers were forced to back down following a backlash from members of the island's parliament, who argued the change was \"unfair\" on pensioners and was being rushed through without a proper debate.",
      "The U-turn is a cautionary tale for critics of the triple lock in the UK.",
      "It underlines the political difficulty of watering down the income of pensioners who tend to vote in greater numbers than younger age groups at elections.",
      "One former UK Treasury adviser told the BBC: \"It's politically too difficult to come up with a pension policy that does not involve committing to the triple lock. It's such a vulnerability in an election campaign.\"",
      "'A lose, lose, lose scenario'",
      "The triple lock was introduced by David Cameron's 2010 coalition government and has proved a reliable way of wooing the grey vote for every administration since.",
      "But it has also become steadily more expensive, as the population ages.",
      "Between 2022 and 2032, the number of pensioners in the UK is projected to increase by 13.8%, according to the ONS.",
      "Meanwhile the fertility rate is declining, suggesting there could be fewer UK-born people entering the workforce and paying taxes to cover welfare costs, including pensions.",
      "The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said spending on pensioners is forecast to rise from \u00a3141bn this year to \u00a3182bn by 2030.",
      "In the Irish Sea, the cost pressures of keeping the triple lock are similarly intimidating politicians on the Isle of Man.",
      "With a population of about 84,000, and a declining birth rate, the Isle of Man has a higher proportion of over 65s than the UK as a whole - 22.5% compared with 19% - and forecasts show the number of retirees on the island is expected to grow.",
      "A report last year suggested, without reform, the fund that pays out the state pension could run out by 2047.",
      "In the UK, the population trends are only going in the same direction, and they look daunting for whichever party wins the next general election, due in 2029 at the latest.",
      "\"The politics here are a nightmare,\" said David Sinclair, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre - UK. \"The problem is that none of the alternatives to removing the triple lock are going to be popular.\"",
      "A return to some model of earnings link is favoured by many economists.",
      "Mr Sinclair said to keep the triple lock, government may have to take on more debt, increase the pension age, raise taxes, or potentially all of the above.",
      "\"For government it's a lose, lose, lose scenario,\" Mr Sinclair said.",
      "He said the Labour government \"will be terrified about even suggesting a cut to the triple lock\" after the outcry over its decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from all but poor pensioners.",
      "The government is raising the state pension by 4.1% this April, on a par with average earnings.",
      "A government spokesperson said its commitment to the triple lock was \"unwavering\" and meant \"millions will see their state pension rise by up to \u00a31,900 over this parliament\".",
      "In the Conservative camp, there have been hints of a shift in attitude to pensions.",
      "Speaking on LBC, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the Conservatives were \"going to look at means-testing\" benefits, in response to a question about the state pension. Her party later insisted she was not referring to the triple lock specifically.",
      "Also, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, has said the triple lock was unsustainable in \"the very, very long term\".",
      "A Conservative source said Stride's comments had been taken out of context and the party was committed to the triple lock.",
      "Politically sensitive",
      "Neither Reform UK nor the Greens mentioned the triple lock in their election manifestos last year, while the Liberal Democrats supported its continuation.",
      "That was no surprise given they mooted the idea in their 2010 manifesto, albeit without the triple lock tag.",
      "Two sources close to the 2010 coalition talks said what became the triple lock was a minor detail in the Tory-Lib Dem agreement, with one saying the Treasury estimated it would cost \u00a350m over a five-year period.",
      "\"Clearly the triple lock will stop at some point,\" Steve Webb, the former Liberal Democrat MP and pensions minister who implemented the policy, told the BBC. \"It was never intended to be permanent.\"",
      "Webb said it was a tool used to \"undo 30 years of damage\" to pensioner living standards, but added \"there will come a point when it's done its job\".",
      "Such is the sensitivity of the issue, few current MPs or anyone actively involved in Westminster politics are willing to talk openly about when that time might come.",
      "One MP, who did not wish to be named, said the triple lock would not be dropped anytime soon, even though there were convincing arguments for doing so.",
      "For now, there's a stubborn silence and talk of tossing out the triple lock remains taboo among this generation of political leaders.",
      "Given the backlash against the watering down of the triple lock on the Isle of Man, the MPs of the future may view what's happening on the island with some trepidation.",

      "In the last week UK and French military planners have been working on options, all of which are at an early stage. One idea is  that a \"reassurance\" force of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 UK and French troops could be deployed after a ceasefire around Ukrainian infrastructure, ports, nuclear power stations, even in some of the key cities.",
      "The model of a joint UK-French force already exists \u2013 the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a deal signed by the two countries several years ago. Another source suggests the best option for a monitoring force would be under the badge of the UN, if the Russians could be persuaded to accept that, with Ukraine's allies stepping up training and support for Ukraine inside the country.",
      "These options in broad terms, given a public airing by Sir Keir Starmer this week, aren't new, one adviser says, and have been suggested in private for a long time. Another source in government says the plan for 30,000 troops is \"not yet an actual thing\" \u2013 there's no detailed blueprint.",
      "But European leaders know they have to prove to Trump they are serious about contributing to a lasting peace, rather than leaving it to the United States.",
      "I'm told when French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump and Zelensky met in the margins of the fanciest international get together of recent times, the reopening of Notre Dame, Trump said that he'd get Russia to the table, Zelensky said that he would go to the negotiating table, and Macron promised he'd make sure Europe played a real part.",
      "It's worth noting that Trump said \"that's great, I'm all for that\", when asked earlier this week about the idea of European troops being deployed was mentioned.",
      "'We know who the goodies are'",
      "But as the talks approach, uncertainty about the US' true view is the fundamental, and some in government are nervous. Does Trump really believe that Zelensky is a \"dictator\" \u2013 or, as Trump's Ukraine envoy suggested yesterday, a \"courageous leader\"? Does Trump want the \"sugar rush\" of a quick deal that might favour Russia asks one former defence minister, more than achieving something long-term?",
      "A Trump backer said it is \"obscene\" to suggest that the president is a Putin sympathiser, pointing to his previous decisions to approve the sale of Javelin missiles to Ukraine.",
      "In No 10, \"we don't think there is a cut and run\", a senior source says. In private, US figures have reassured the UK that the United States is not about to turn its back on Ukraine.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "In Brussels last week the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made headlines when he signalled the US would reduce its support for Ukraine \u2013  but a source in the room during the private talks after his controversial public remarks told me Hegseth said \"we know who the goodies are and who the baddies are\".",
      "There is though anxiety in government that Trump might be tempted to just force a deal to end the conflict, then Russia could \"just reload then go again\", according to another source.",
      "But there is a shaky faith \u2013 perhaps more accurately a fervent hope \u2013 that whatever the president's public remarks, that the US will try to involve Ukraine in the talks and does think the peace has to be a deal that lasts, with a force that looks credible, potentially with some form of American support.",
      "Emmanuel Macron, and then Sir Keir, will try to persuade Trump that a deal with security guarantees for Ukraine is the only true victory for the White House.",
      "Remember why all this matters so much back home. What Trump decides to do about the conflict has an effect not just on the security of our continent but our prosperity too: the Ukraine war has shaken our economy through the effect it's had on energy bills.",
      "There is also, of course, the simple and awful human cost of lives lost \u2013 Ukrainians and Russians \u2013 hundreds of thousands of casualties, with terrible suffering on the edge of Europe. Thousands of families in the UK opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees at the start of the war.",
      "The former defence minister notes: \"Sometimes when there is all this noise, we have to still find a way to keep supporting them. Who knows when it is going to end, the only thing we know is they are still being attacked.\"",
      "As the war's three-year anniversary approaches you can expect to hear this message from government too.",
      "And of course what happens matters enormously to the fortunes of this government. Sir Keir might have a huge majority, but he has battled to retain political momentum and his popularity has plunged since taking office.",
      "He may even want to bring other things to the famous Resolute desk beyond defence and Ukraine: Trump is, a senior government source says, notoriously unpredictable and may swerve off topic.",
      "A source familiar with Trump's thinking suggests the PM could turn Trump's freewheeling style to his advantage by putting other issues on the table \u2013 an offer to buy more American Liquid Natural Gas perhaps, revising the deal on the Chagos Islands, a tougher position on China, or a discussion about tech regulation perhaps, with Apple in a huff with the UK government.",
      "Starmer might not have chosen \u2013 few prime ministers do \u2013 to have to confront complicated foreign policy tangles early in office. But one Whitehall observer notes \"kudos to No 10 for handling Trump\" so far, not reacting to his every outburst.",
      "And Brexit, ironically, helps Sir Keir the Remainer carve out a separate role to the rest of Europe.",
      "Working with Trump might be like handling a live firework. But the international jeopardy does present opportunities for the PM, as one former senior official suggests.",
      "If \"you don't have much of a compelling agenda, your social policy is looking hard, your economic policy is looking hard, you can see why he might think,  do you know, the air miles are starting to look pretty attractive\".",
      "This week presents Sir Keir with all sorts of dangers, but also, a chance to lead.",

    "story": [
      "Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky.",
      "This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040.",
      "The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",
      "Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.",
      "A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.",
      "Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: \"There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.\"",
      "As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.",
      "\"You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added.",
      "The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.",
      "As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.",
      "Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",
      "Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",
      "Venus and Jupiter will be the easiest to spot due to their brightness, while Mars will have a distinct reddish hue.",
      "\"Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,\" Dr Bloomer explains.",
      "To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.",
      "\"If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,\" said Dr Bloomer.",
      "\"Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.\"",
      "While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky.",
      "\"See how things change,\" he said, adding that observing the heavens is \"a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.\"",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see them?",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:33:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",
      "Scientists warn against complacency, saying it is a matter of when, not if, a large asteroid will threaten human life on Earth, although most expect that to be in the coming centuries rather than decades.",
      "In the meantime, our ability to monitor space keeps improving. Later this year the largest digital camera ever built will begin working at the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, able to capture the night sky in incredible detail.",
      "And the closer and longer we look, the more asteroids spinning close to Earth we are likely to spot.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:13:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

      "BBC Future: The ethereal art of capturing fog",
      "World's glaciers melting faster than ever recorded",
      "Concerns UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.",
      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",
      "Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is \"very special\" for its sea fog, \"because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains\".",
      "Her team is currently working on a \"fog harvesting map\" of the whole country.",
      "\"Water from the clouds\", as Dr Carter describes it, could, she said, \"enhance our cities' resilience to climate change, while improving access to clean water\".",

      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",

      "The message did not mention whether a failure to respond would be considered a resignation.",

      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",

      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",

      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",

      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",

      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",

    "summary": "It found they were easily able to bypass age checks on apps, which face being banned for under-16s.",
    "story": [
      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",
      "The regulator accused the apps of \"a lack of robust interventions\" for checking the ages of their users.",
      "The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",
      "For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.",
      "In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.",
      "It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.",
      "\"The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,\" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant.",
      "Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.",
      "In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -  took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a TikTok spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",
      "A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies.",
      "'84% use social media'",
      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",
      "If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.",
      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",
      "\"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.\"",
      "The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.",
      "Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.",
      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",
      "\"This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms.\""

      "Apple has been struggling to find a new product that excites consumers - sales of iPhones dropped at the end of last year.",
      "It will be hoping that bringing enhanced AI functionality to a less expensive phone will address that - however analysts have been cautious about the sales boost such tools bring.",
      "Its name is clearly a nod to its iPhone SE series, which were released from 2016 to  2022, and were also lower priced.",
      "Apple said the iPhone 16e would be available for pre-order from 21 February in 59 countries.",
      "It will launch in the UK for \u00a3599, which is \u00a3200 less than the iPhone 16 - but more than double the price of the original iPhone SE went for when it launched in 2016.",

      "It is the first time Apple has used its own modem design for the iPhone, having previously relied on Qualcomm and Intel's chips to provide cellular connectivity.",
      "This also meant paying costly licensing fees to those chip giants - something Apple has previously wrangled over with Qualcomm in court.",
      "Adopting its own modems would also help the tech giant realise a vision laid out by chief executive Tim Cook in 2009 of owning and controlling the tech powering its products.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Much of the conversation around the new handset will probably centre around its power, with Apple electing to use the same A18 chip behind its more expensive devices.",
      "This means the 16e will be capable of playing the same games and running the same apps as other iPhones - though AI is almost certainly at the heart of this decision.",
      "Mr Cook said in the announcement the new model featured \"the performance, intelligence and privacy\" Apple fans \"expect\" from the firm.",
      "And he said the Apple Intelligence features on the device would \"help you save time, quickly get more things done, and express yourself in new ways\".",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",
      "Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced.",
      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",
      "Jensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years.",

      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",
      "The more qubits a chip has the more capable it is.",
      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",

      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",

      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:47:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As the first European leader to visit Trump since his inauguration, Macron navigated potentially testing talks.",
    "story": [
      "Relations between Europe and the US are unquestionably in crisis, so merely keeping things together as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the White House on Monday stands as an achievement.",
      "He did that by praising, flattering and gently cajoling the US president as they took questions in the Oval Office and held a joint news conference. This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.",
      "Macron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much.",
      "He spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.",
      "But Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "That is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.",
      "\"There is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin,\" Macron said, adding that the new administration represented \"a big change\".",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron saysZelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron says",
      "Zelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Macron held out the prospect of European countries such as France and the UK being willing to play a leading role in ensuring the security of a post-truce Ukraine, possibly in the form of air power and troops stationed away from the frontline.",
      "But at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.",
      "Macron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office. And if he was looking for a scintilla of criticism of the Russian president from Trump, then he did not get that either.",
      "What he did get was, at least to some extent, Europe's voice back at the table and he, along with other European leaders, will take some heart from that.",
      "It is clear however, that the ambitions for re-establishing the kind of close relationship that Europe and the US have had since the end of World War Two are not on anyone's roadmap.",
      "That is why Macron himself has been working on the idea of a more strategically autonomous Europe for some time, toying with ideas of combined European defence forces.",
      "His sense that Europe needs to adapt given the dramatic shift in the US position is shared by Friedrich Merz, who will be Germany's next chancellor.",
      "Merz has already said that he believes the US under Donald Trump is indifferent to Europe's fate, and that the continent needs to be independent of the US in terms of security.",
      "\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.",
      "But France, the UK and Germany have also got to be cognisant of the fact that not all European powers are so hostile to the US view on Ukraine.",
      "The rise of far-right nationalist parties in Europe, most notably in places like Germany where the AfD came second in Sunday's elections, suggests some European citizens are also sceptical about the continent's continued support for Kyiv.",
      "Later this week, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has been closely co-ordinating with his French counterpart, will come to Washington to reinforce their case on Ukraine.",
      "He, like Macron, believes his country has a special relationship with the US which can open doors and get a fair hearing.",
      "The problem is that Washington in the shape of Donald Trump is on transmit mode at the moment \u2013 pushing an agenda that leaves little room for the opinion of others.",
      "And while America has always had the ability to flex its muscles and get its way, Europe for the most part has not been on the receiving end. The fact that has changed is a sign of just how serious this rupture in established alliances has become.",

      "Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.",
      "It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.",
      "The conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.",
      "The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.",
      "\"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\"",
      "The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.",
      "The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.",
      "The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance \u2013 on which the communal kitchens depend \u2013 will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.",
      "The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.",

      "\"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets (humanitarian group) in Syria.\"",
      "For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:48:57 GMT",
    "summary": "It makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations.",
    "story": [
      "Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, says it expects to cut about 4,000 roles over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) takes on more work currently done by humans.",
      "The move will affect temporary and contract staff, a bank spokesperson said, with the reduction in the workforce coming from \"natural attrition\" as projects are completed.",
      "Permanent staff are not affected by the cuts. The bank's outgoing chief executive Piyush Gupta also said it expected to create around 1,000 new AI-related jobs.",
      "It makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations.",
      "The company did not say how many jobs would be cut in Singapore.",
      "\"Over the next three years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects,\" the DBS spokesperson said.",
      "\"As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years.\"",
      "DBS currently has between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers. The bank employs a total of around 41,000 people.",
      "Last year, Mr Gupta said DBS had been working on AI for over a decade.",
      "\"We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn ($745m; \u00a3592m) in 2025,\" he added.",
      "Mr Gupta is set to leave the firm at the end of March. Current deputy chief executive Tan Su Shan will replace him.",
      "The ongoing proliferation of AI technology has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying in 2024 that it is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide.",
      "The IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that \"in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality\".",
      "The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC last year that AI will not be a \"mass destroyer of jobs\" and human workers will learn to work with new technologies.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 21:31:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The announcement could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria more likely.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria.",
      "It is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely.",
      "In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to \"enter the area south of Damascus\".",
      "\"We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,\" he added. \"Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.\"",
      "He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy.",
      "Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side.",
      "The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum.",
      "But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger.",
      "Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019.",
      "Syria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973.",
      "He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel.",
      "But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape.",
      "Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances.",
      "Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words.",
      "From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past.",
      "Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had.",
      "Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country.",
      "There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad.",
      "How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era.",
      "But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership.",
      "To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide.",
      "Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain.",

    "story": [
      "Candidates vying to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada faced each other for the first time on Monday in a French-language debate.",
      "The stage was shared by four hopefuls: former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, Liberal government House leader Karina Gould, and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "The question of how to deal with Donald Trump dominated the first half, as the US president has repeatedly threatened to tariff Canada and make it the \"51st state.\"",
      "Candidates also answered questions about domestic matters like immigration, healthcare and the high cost of living.",
      "Early in the debate, Freeland - whose resignation as finance minister in December triggered the collapse of Trudeau's leadership - stated that Trump represented \"the greatest threat to Canada since World War Two\".",
      "She frequently drew on her experience in government, saying that she had successfully faced Trump during his first term when she helped renegotiate North America's longstanding free-trade agreement.",
      "But Freeland warned that Trump's second term might be worse for Canada.",
      "\"He wants to turn Canada into the 51st state, and it's no joke,\" she said. \"That is why he is supporting [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's criminal attempt to redraw Ukraine's borders.\"",
      "\"Trump wants to redraw our borders too,\" Freeland said.",
      "To counter these threats, Freeland and the other candidates suggested strengthening trade ties with the EU and the UK.",
      "Baylis proposed a \"new economic bloc\" consisting of Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia, noting that all four countries shared the same values, cultures and governing systems.",
      "Carney, who is frontrunner in the polls, focused his message on helping Canada achieve economic prosperity. He proposed doing so by leveraging its resources, including critical minerals and metals, as well as making Canada a \"superpower of clean energy\" and removing trade barriers between provinces.",
      "He, too, agreed with Freeland that Trump's second term was different from the first.",
      "\"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "He added that he would be in favour of imposing dollar-for-dollar tariffs on the US should Trump move ahead with his threat to levy a 25% tax on all Canadian goods starting on 4 March.",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate on the stage, positioned herself as the candidate \"for today and the future\", with a message that homed in on how a Liberal Party under her leadership would work to make life more affordable for Canadians.",
      "The candidates also addressed shifting US policy on Ukraine. As the four debated, Trudeau was in Kyiv marking three years since the Russia-Ukraine war began.",
      "All four candidates agreed that Canada should continue supporting Ukraine. Freeland suggested that money seized from Russia through sanctions be redistributed to help Ukraine's war effort, while Carney stated that any discussion on Ukraine's future could not happen without the Ukrainians at the table.",
      "Freeland also suggested that Canada should foster closer ties with Denmark which, she noted. was also facing threats from Trump who has signalled his desire to take over Greenland - a Danish territory.",
      "For the second half of the debate, candidates offered up their ideas for how to help Canada reduce its federal budget deficit, tackle crime and increase its military spending.",
      "They were also asked about climate change, with both Freeland and Carney saying they no longer supported a carbon tax on consumers - a key climate policy of the Trudeau government that has become unpopular with Canadians.",
      "At certain points, candidates also took aim at Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, saying he would be unfit to defend Canada against Trump.",
      "Poilievre is currently leading in the national polls, though the gap between him and the Liberal Party has narrowed since Trudeau's resignation. The Conservative leader has since focused his attacks on Carney, arguing that a Liberal Party under his leadership would not be different from that under Trudeau.",
      "Monday's debate is the first of two, with a second, English-language debate slated for Tuesday. Liberal Party members will vote for their next leader on 9 March, after which Trudeau is expected to step down.",
      "The French-language debate is especially important for Francophone Canadians in Quebec, whose votes are influential in helping decide which party will form Canada's next government.",

      "Various relief teams, including personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, firefighters and soldiers from the Indian army, are at the spot.",

      "\"We covered 11km by train, 2km by conveyor belt and the remaining distance on foot,\" an official, who wanted to stay anonymous, said. \"But then we hit a roadblock.\"",
      "\"There were tall mounds of mud and soft soil. The boring machine that was being used by the workers lay upside down, blocking all passage beyond.\"",

      "\"We shouted and screamed, whistled and pointed torches, hoping for a response but didn't hear anything.\"",

    "summary": "Clint Hill spent decades blaming himself for Kennedy's death before re-evaluating his role.",
    "story": [
      "A US Secret Service agent who leapt on to John F Kennedy's limousine as it came under fire in Dallas, and was pictured in famous photos of one of the most dramatic events in US history, has died at the age of 93.",
      "Clint Hill later became a bestselling author, but was haunted for decades by guilt over Kennedy's assassination.",
      "Hill died at his home on California on Friday, according to a statement from his publicist.",
      "On 22 November 1963, he was assigned to protect the president's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy.",
      "Hill was riding on a car behind the Kennedy limousine when the first shot rang out.",
      "He immediately rushed towards the couple and started to climb on to the back of the limousine as the shooting continued.",
      "Hill's actions during the assassination were captured on the Zapruder film \u2013 an amateur home video that provided one of the best recordings of the shooting.",
      "Hill, originally from North Dakota, served in the Army prior to joining the Secret Service in 1958.",
      "He was given an award for his actions in Dallas and eventually rose to become assistant director of the Secret Service.",
      "However the trauma he experienced during the assassination led him to retire early from the agency in 1975, at the age of 43.",
      "He had become convinced that he could have saved Kennedy's life and shortly after his retirement told CBS 60 Minutes that he felt responsible.",
      "\"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said.",
      "\"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" asked interviewer Mike Wallace.",
      "\"Yes, sir... That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.",
      "\"I have a great deal of guilt about that,\" he said. \"Had I turned in a different direction, I'd have made it. It's my fault.\"",
      "As the years went by, the former Secret Service agent later told a documentary, he returned to Dallas, eventually coming to the conclusion he could not have saved Kennedy's life.",
      "Hill met journalist Lisa McCubbin in 2009 and collaborated on a bestselling memoir, Mrs Kennedy and Me.",
      "It was the first of a series of books and Hill and McCubbin fell in love. The couple married in 2021.",
      "A statement from his publisher said that Hill had died at home with his wife at his side. A cause of death was not given."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:08:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Germany's main parties refuse to work with the far right, but the AfD wants to tear the firewall down.",
    "story": [
      "One in five Germans put an X in the box for Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday: a record result that has made them the second biggest force in German politics.",
      "Riding on the back of that success, the party is now calling for an end to the consensus in German politics not to work with the far right.",
      "That \"firewall\" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them.\"",
      "There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: \"We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\"",
      "The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%.",
      "\"East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall,\" said Tino Chrupalla.",
      "Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third.",
      "Even though his party won 28.6% of the vote, it was still their second-worst result since World War Two.",
      "Support for the AfD doubled, and a million of their voters deserted Merz's conservatives for them, according to a survey by research institute Infratest dimap.",
      "Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called \"remigration\".",
      "The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations.",
      "One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more.",
      "Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration.",
      "But he was clearly stung by a public outcry and the mass protests that followed in many German cities.",
      "Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left.",
      "But now the AfD has more than 150 seats in parliament, its supporters in particular believe it is time for the firewall to go.",
      "\"I just hope that the firewall will fall. But we all know that it won't be like that,\" says pro-AfD TikTok influencer Celina Brychcy, 26.",
      "\"I think it will fall at the latest when new elections are held. Then they'll have to realise at some point they can't get through with what they're doing right now.\"",
      "\"I think the Brandmauer will stay,\" says Dominic, 30, who voted for the AfD in Saxony. \"I want the government to really think about their own people and their own country.\"",

      "Conservatives celebrate, but AfD doubles vote",
      "Pressure to take down the long-standing firewall is not just coming from the AfD, but from leading figures in the Trump administration too, including US Vice-President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who has repeatedly backed the party.",
      "Most of the voices you hear challenging the firewall come from the east, which may not be surprising considering the deep reach of the AfD, especially in the five eastern states out of a total of 16 across Germany.",
      "They won 38.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 37.% in both Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, far ahead of the CDU. It makes them increasingly difficult to keep at arm's length.",
      "On one of the big talkshows on German TV on Monday night, Harsh but Fair, one local mayor from Saxony, Mirko Geissler, believed the AfD should be put on the \"playing field\", so they could show what they could do. If not, they would end up surging to 40-50% in the polls, he warned.",
      "Liane Bach, an independent mayor from a village in Thuringia said that in her region, \"AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists\".",
      "A CDU politician on the programme, Phillip Amthor, conceded there should be \"no firewalls between the democratic parties and people who vote AfD\".",
      "That is the main issue the big national parties will have to address. How to avoid ostracising AfD voters who clearly have no problem with the firewall being breached.",
      "One mayor pointed out that one of her fellow residents who was also an AfD councillor was fixing the local fountain. It made no sense not to work with him.",
      "Prof Conrad Ziller from the University of Duisburg-Essen believes the greatest threat to the firewall could come at state level, rather than nationally.",
      "\"If you have trouble building a coalition in a state, then at some point, there could be a minority government that relies on the AfD, or gets votes from the AfD from time to time.\"",
      "On a national level, the worst-case scenario would be for a breakdown in a Merz-led coalition: \"Merz could make mistakes. If he gets really tough on immigration, it might become problematic with the SPD.\"",
      "Germany has already seen one early election because of a coalition collapse, and the AfD's Alice Weidel has made clear she is looking for early elections.",
      "Her repeated appearances on TV election debates have made her a prominent figure in Germany and helped raise her party's profile.",
      "But it was the constant focus on migration and security that became the number one issue for AfD voters, partly fuelled by three deadly attacks, all allegedly carried out by immigrants.",
      "Tackling insecurity, and the perception of it, will be an immediate task for the next government, when it eventually takes shape.",
      "Underlying the urgency, Bavaria's centre-right leader Markus S\u00f6der said the need to tackle immigration, along with Germany's faltering economy, was \"in fact, the last bullet of democracy\".",
      "There is no question of breaching the long-standing firewall for the moment.",
      "And the general secretary of Merz's party, Tom Unger, was adamant that there should be no collaboration with a party that opposed Germany's ties with the West, its membership of Nato and \"the European idea\".",
      "That was incompatible, he said, with the conservatives' \"core DNA\"."

      "Merz wants to continue that support, but, unlike France and the UK, he's been reticent about the idea of sending soldiers to Ukraine, to back up an eventual ceasefire there.",
      "Based on Germany's track record though - it dragged its heels at every stage of Ukraine support, and despite that, ended up delivering more aid than any of its European neighbours - a 'No' now, doesn't mean a 'No' forever to committing troops or participating in whatever form a European \"reassurance force\" in Ukraine may take.",

      "Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won, but Germany's 2025 election has thrown up some important and fascinating stories that reveal a country in flux.",
      "Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has doubled its support in just four years to 20.8%, and has spread out from its support base in the east to become the second biggest political force in parliament.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD had its worst performance in decades, only securing 16.4% of the vote.",
      "Here are five key takeaways.",
      "AfD dominant in east, spreading to the west",
      "Look at an election results map of Germany, and you could almost have travelled back in time to the Cold War, when an iron curtain divided communist East Germany from the west.",
      "In the east it's a swathe of AfD light blue, apart from pockets like Berlin and half of Leipzig. In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz's conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape.",
      "But the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone.",
      "For one in five Germans it has become normalised. \"They're just normal people,\" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany's old industrial heartland.",
      "Even though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a \"firewall\" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany's main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two.",
      "The AfD's leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist. Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants.",
      "The AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called \"remigration\", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants.",
      "In May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation. Judges found that the AfD had \"positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy\".",
      "In three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist.",
      "A leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan \"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\" - everything for Germany. Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase \"Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland\".",
      "Germans voted in biggest turnout for 40 years",
      "Not since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west.",
      "Four years ago it was 76.6%.",
      "Put simply, more than four in every five of Germany's 59.2 million voters turned out.",
      "It reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country. There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience.",
      "All over for leaders of collapsed government",
      "The three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday's election, all three leaders have said they're leaving the front line of politics.",
      "The leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first. Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years. But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he's leaving politics after 25 years.",
      "It was Lindner's refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness.",
      "Although Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won't be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics.",
      "Greens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election.",
      "TikTok generation hauls Left back from dead",
      "Until a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs.",
      "Wagenknecht's popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament.",
      "The story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign.",
      "Heidi Reichinnek, Die Linke's co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD.",
      "She now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views.",
      "Her party secured just under 9% of the vote.",
      "Young go left and right, old stick to centre",
      "Die Linke's viral videos helped secure a quarter of the 18-24 vote, and the AfD were not far behind with 21%, according to surveys by ARD TV.",
      "Alice Weidel was the biggest hit on social media during the election, even bigger than Heidi Reichinnek. She has attracted more than 935,000 followers on TikTok.",
      "For the over-35s, it was the Christian Democrats who won out, and more men than women."

    "summary": "Three years on from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump has changed everything",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv no longer looks like a city at war in the way that it was three years ago. The shops are open and commuters get delayed in traffic jams on their way to work. But in the days since 12 February this year when US President Donald Trump rang Russia's Vladimir Putin to send a 90-minute political embrace from the White House to the Kremlin, 2022's old nightmares of national extinction have returned. Ukrainians used to get angry about the way that President Joe Biden held back weapons systems and restricted the way Ukraine used the ones that arrived here. Even so, they knew whose side he was on.",
      "Instead, Donald Trump has delivered a stream of exaggeration, half-truths and outright lies about the war that echo the views of President Putin. They include his dismissal of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as a dictator who does not deserve a seat at the table when America and Russia decide the future of his country. The biggest lie Trump has told is that Ukraine started the war.",
      "Trump's negotiating strategy is to offer concessions even before serious talks have started. Instead of putting pressure on the country that broke international law by invading its neighbour, leading to huge destruction and hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded, he has turned on Ukraine.",
      "His public statements have offered Russia important concessions, declaring that Ukraine will not join Nato and accepting that it will keep at least some of the land it seized by force. Vladimir Putin's record shows he respects strength. He regards concessions as a sign of weakness.",
      "He has not budged from a demand for even more Ukrainian land than his men now occupy. Immediately after the first talks, held in Saudi Arabia, between Russia and the US since the 2022 invasion, Putin's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov repeated his demand that no Nato troops would be allowed into Ukraine to provide security guarantees.",
      "A veteran European diplomat who has dealt with the Russians and the Americans told me that when the grizzled, highly experienced Lavrov met Trump's novice Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"he would have eaten him like a soft-boiled egg.\"",
      "Challenging times",
      "A few days ago, as Trump threw more insults at Ukraine's president, I went to the heavily guarded government quarter in Kyiv to meet Ihor Brusylo, who is a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky and deputy head of his office. Brusylo acknowledged how much pressure Trump is putting on them.",
      "\"It's very, very tough. These are very hard, challenging times,\" Brusylo said. \"I wouldn't say that now it's easier than it was in 2022. It's like you live it all over again.\"",
      "Brusylo said Ukrainians, and their president, were as determined to fight to stay independent as they had been in 2022.",
      "\"We're a sovereign country. We are part of Europe, and we will remain so.\"",
      "Fading colours",
      "In the weeks after Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the sound of battle on the edge of Kyiv echoed around streets that were almost empty. Checkpoints and barricades, walls of sandbags and tank traps welded from steel girders were rushed out onto Kyiv's broad boulevards. At the railway station, fifty thousand civilians a day, mostly women and children, were boarding trains going west, away from the Russians.",
      "The platforms were packed and every time a train pulled in, came another surge of panic as people pushed and shoved to get on. In those freezing days, in bitter wind and flurries of snow, it felt as if the colours of the 21st century were fading into an old monochrome newsreel that Europeans had believed until then was safely consigned to the vaults of history.",
      "President Zelensky, in Joe Biden's words, \"didn't want to hear\" American warnings that an invasion was imminent. Putin rattling a Russian sabre was one thing. A full-scale invasion, with tens of thousands of troops and columns of armour, surely belonged in the past.",
      "Putin believed Russia's mighty and modernised army would make quick work of its obstinate, independent neighbour and its recalcitrant president. Ukraine's western allies also thought Russia would win quickly. On television news channels, retired generals talked about smuggling in light weapons to arm an insurgency while the west imposed sanctions and hoped for the best.",
      "As Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders, Germany delivered 5,000 ballistic combat helmets instead of offensive weapons. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and once heavyweight boxing champion of the world, complained to a German newspaper that it was \"a joke\u2026 What kind of support will Germany send next, pillows?\"",
      "Zelensky turned down any idea of leaving his capital to form a government in exile. He abandoned his presidential dark suit for military attire, and in videos and on social media told Ukrainians he would fight alongside them.",
      "Ukraine defeated the Russian thrust towards the capital. Once the Ukrainians had demonstrated that they could fight well, the attitude of the Americans and Europeans changed. Arms supplies increased.",
      "\"Putin's mistake was that he prepared for a parade not a war\" a senior Ukrainian official recalled, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"He didn't think Ukraine would fight. He thought they would be welcomed with speeches and flowers.\"",
      "On 29 March 2022, the Russians retreated from Kyiv. Hours after they left, we drove, nervously, into the chaotic, damaged landscape of Kyiv's satellite towns, Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel. On the roads the Russians had hoped to use for a triumphant entry into Kyiv, I saw bodies of civilians left where they were killed. Charred tyres were stacked around some of them, failed attempts to burn the evidence of war crimes.",
      "Survivors spoke of the brutality of the Russian occupiers. A woman showed me the grave where she had buried her son single-handed after he was casually shot dead as he crossed a road. Russian soldiers threw her out of her house. In the garden, they left piles of empty bottles of vodka, whisky and gin that they had looted and drunk. Hastily abandoned Russian encampments in the forests near the roads were choked with rubbish their soldiers had discarded over the weeks of occupation.",
      "Professional, disciplined armies do not eat and sleep next to rotting piles of their own refuse.",
      "Three years on, the war has changed. Although Kyiv has revived, it still has nightly alerts as its air defences detect incoming Russian missiles and drones. The war is closer, and more deadly, along the front line, more than 1,000 kilometres long, that runs from the northern border with Russia and then east and south down to the Black Sea. It is lined with destroyed, almost deserted villages and towns. To the east, in what was Kyiv's industrial heartland of Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian forces grind forward slowly, at a huge cost in men and machines.",
      "Echoes of the past",
      "Last August, Ukraine sent troops into Russia, capturing a pocket of land across the border in Kursk. They are still there, fighting for land that Zelensky hopes to use as a bargaining chip.",
      "Along the border with Kursk, in the snow-covered forests of north-eastern Ukraine, the geopolitical storm set off by Donald Trump is still not much more than a menacing, distant rumble. It will get here, especially if the US president follows up his harsh and mocking verbal attacks on president Zelensky with a final end to military aid and intelligence-sharing, and even worse from Ukraine's perspective, an attempt to impose a peace deal that favours Russia.",
      "For now, the rhythm built up in three years of war goes on, and the forest could be a throwback to the blood-soaked twentieth century. Fighting men move silently through the trees, along trenches and into bunkers dug deep into the frozen earth. In stretches of open ground, anti-tank defences made of concrete and steel stud the fields.",
      "The 21st century is more present in the dry and warm underground bunkers. Generators and solar panels power laptops and screens linked to the outside world, and bring in the news feeds.",
      "Just because bad news arrives doesn't mean that the soldiers look at it. In a deep dug-out lined with bunks made of rough planks from the local sawmill, with nails hammered into the timber to hang weapons and winter uniforms, Evhen, a 30-year-old corporal said he had more urgent matters to think about \u2013 his men and the wife and two small children he left at home when he joined up, ten months ago.",
      "That's a long time on the front line in Kursk. He looks and sounds like a combat veteran. He has faced the North Koreans who have been sent to join the battle there by their leader, Putin's ally, Kim Jong Un.",
      "\"Koreans fight till the end. Even if he is injured and you come to him, he might just blow himself up to take more of us with him.\"",
      "All the soldiers we interviewed asked to be referred to by first names for their own security. Evhen seemed relaxed about fighting on without the Americans.",
      "\"Help is not something that can last forever. We have it today, we don't have it tomorrow.\"",
      "Ukraine, he said, was making many more of its own weapons. That's true, especially when it comes to attack drones, but the US still supplies sophisticated systems that have damaged the Russians badly.",
      "A bitter fault line",
      "Many of the volunteers who took up arms three years ago have either been killed, maimed, or are too exhausted to fight any more. One of Ukraine's most bitter fault lines runs between those who fight and those who bribe their way out of military service. Evhen said they were better off without them.",
      "\"It is better for them to pay not to fight than to come here and run away, tripping us up. It doesn't bother me much. If they came here, they'd just scarper\u2026 they're deserters.\"",
      "War strips away surplus thought. The stakes are straightforward for soldiers preparing to return to the battle in Kursk. Mykola, who commands a company of airborne assault troops, spoke affectionately about the capabilities of their Stryker armoured vehicles, supplied by the Americans.",
      "\"Kursk\" he says, \"shows the enemy, a nuclear weapons state, that a non-nuclear power with a smaller population and a smaller army can come in, capture land and the Russians have been able to do very little about it.\"",
      "Putin's objectives, he said, were clear.",
      "\"His task is to seize all of Ukraine, change its legal status, and change the president and government. He wants to destroy our political system and to make Ukraine his vassal state.\"",
      "He laughed when I asked whether the Americans and others should trust Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"No! I don't have enough fingers to count how many times Putin lied. To everyone! To the Russians, and to us, and to Western partners. He lied to everyone.\"",
      "Growing up in war",
      "At a volunteer centre in Kyiv in the first days after the invasion, I met two young students, Maxsym Lutsyk, 19, and Dmytro Kisilenko, 18, who were signing up to fight.",
      "When they lined up alongside men old enough to be their fathers as well as other teenage recruits, they carried camping gear and could have been friends off to a festival, except for their assault rifles. At the time, I wrote \"18 and 19-year-old lads have always gone off to war. I thought in Europe we'd got past that.\" A few weeks later, Maxsym and Dmytro were in uniform and manning a checkpoint just behind the Kyiv front line, still students joking about their parents.",
      "Both fought in the battle of Kyiv. Dmytro chose to leave the army, his right as a student volunteer, when the fight switched to the east. He is preparing to fight again if necessary, training to be an officer at the National Military University. Maxsym stayed in uniform, serving in the front line in the east for more than two years. Now he is an officer working in military intelligence.",
      "I have stayed in touch with them as, like millions of other young people here, war shapes their adult lives in ways they never expected. Trump's move towards Moscow makes them feel almost as if they have to start again.",
      "\"We mobilised,\" Dmytro says. \"We mobilised our resources, our people, and I think it's time that we repeat it once again.\"",
      "Parallels with the past",
      "Unlike the men in the forest on the Kursk border, they follow the news. Donald Trump's diplomatic and strategic bombshells, starting at the Munich security conference only 10 days ago, reminds them of the infamous deal Britain's prime minister Neville Chamberlain made at Munich in 1938, forcing Czechoslovakia to capitulate to the demands made by Adolf Hitler.",
      "\"It's similar,\" Maxsym said. \"The West gives an aggressor an opportunity to occupy some territories. The West is making a deal with the aggressor, with the United States in the role of Great Britain.\"",
      "\"It's a very dangerous moment for the entire world, not only for Ukraine,\" Maxsym went on. \"We can see that Europe is starting to wake up\u2026 but if they wanted to be ready for the war, they should [have] begun a few years ago.\"",
      "Dmytro agreed about the dangers ahead.",
      "\"I think that Donald Trump wants to become like a new Neville Chamberlain\u2026 Mr. Trump should be more focused on becoming more like Winston Churchill.\"",
      "The Trump effect",
      "If you're a real estate developer, as Donald Trump was before he went into reality TV and then presidential politics, demolition makes money.  Acquire a property, tear it down, rebuild and win. The trouble with that strategy in foreign policy is that sovereignty and independence don't have a price tag. Trump boasts he puts America first, but he is not prepared to accept that non-Americans can feel the same about their own countries.",
      "Since Trump was sworn in for the second time as president of the United States, he has been swinging the wrecking ball. He sent Elon Musk into the federal government to recoup billions of dollars he claims are being stolen or wasted. Abroad, Trump the demolition man has set about the assumptions that underpin the 80-year alliance between the US and European democracies.",
      "Donald Trump is unpredictable, but much of what he is doing he has talked about for years. He is not the first American president to resent the way its European allies have saved money by sheltering behind the US defence budget. The phrase used by his defence secretary Pete Hegseth to his Nato partners, that \"President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker\" was a conscious reference back to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.",
      "A US government document from 4 November 1959 records his frustration. It says: \"The President said that for five years he has been urging the State Department to put the facts of life before the Europeans He thinks the Europeans are close to 'making a sucker out of Uncle Sam.'\"",
      "Trump wants payback. He demanded half a trillion dollars of mineral rights from Ukraine. Zelensky turned that deal down, saying he couldn't sell his country. He wants security guarantees in exchange for any concessions.",
      "In private, European politicians and diplomats recognise that, with Joe Biden, they gave Ukraine enough military and financial support not to lose to Russia, but never enough to win. The argument for more of the same is that Russia, weakened by sanctions and drained of manpower as its generals squander their men's lives, will eventually lose a war of attrition. That is far from certain.",
      "Wars usually end with agreements. Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945 was a rarity. The complaint against Trump is that he has no real plan, so he has followed a gut instinct to get closer to Vladimir Putin, a man he admires. Trump seems to believe that strong leaders from the most powerful states can bend the world into the shape they want. The concessions Trump has already offered to Putin reinforce the idea that his top priority is normalising relations with Russia.",
      "Confronting Putin",
      "A more credible plan would have been to include a way to make Putin drop ideas that are lodged deep in his geostrategic DNA. One of the strongest is that Ukraine's sovereignty must be broken and control of the country returned to the Kremlin, as it was in Soviet times and before that in the empire of Russia's Czars.",
      "It is hard to see how that happens. The idea is as unlikely as Ukraine surrendering its independence to Moscow. Europe's security is being turned upside down by the war in Ukraine. No wonder its leaders are so badly rattled by all they have heard and seen this month.",
      "Their challenge is to find ways to avoid their young people being forced into the unexpected world of war that has enveloped Maxsym Lutsyk, the 22-year-old Ukrainian combat veteran.",
      "\"Everyone changed, and I have changed. I think that every Ukrainian matured during these three years. Everyone who entered the military and everyone who was fighting for such a long time drastically changed.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:55:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine's mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says.",
      "Olga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\".",
      "She added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".",
      "Ukraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.",
      "Zelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Follow live updates",
      "The idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.",
      "On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.",
      "Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Trump has changed Ukraine conversation, Starmer says",
      "Zelensky willing to give up presidency in exchange for Nato membership",
      "Why does the US want them?",
      "Critical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.",
      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "On Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\".",
      "What do we know about the negotiations so far?",
      "Prior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.",
      "Last Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.",
      "\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.",
      "The provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.",
      "Instead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.",
      "Trump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.",
      "However, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.",
      "Zelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.",
      "On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".",
      "He rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",
      "Putin proposes Russia-US partnership on rare minerals",
      "On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.",
      "In a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.",
      "\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\"."

    "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for best actor, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",

She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.' Ooh, 'Kissed your mouth!' Once the kids got past the giggles, we were good.\"",

After years of reflection and now thoughtful, the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2. The adventure seekers who trust the vision and take the leap will help make history.\"",
      "For now, it's unclear what exactly festival attendees are getting for their money. The festival's site promises arts, cuisine, music, comedy, fashion, gaming, sports and \"treasures.\" But no musical artists have committed to performing at the three-day event, slated for May 30 to June 2. Instead, so-called \"Fyre Experiences\" will be released in a number of drops leading up to the festival,\" its website says.",
      "Lostnights, a Mexican festival producer, will produce and operate the event.",
      "What does $1 million buy you?",

      "A package valued at roughly $1.1 million, dubbed the \"Prometheus God of Fyre\" pass, covers accommodations for up to eight people, although other perks are not specified. The pass grants access to \"unique adventures, intimate dinners and other exclusive excursions,\" the festival site notes, without providing additional details.",
      "Guests with the highest-priced pass can choose to stay on either a yacht or in a villa, according to the Fyre website, and will travel by private air travel from Miami to Cancun, then by helicopter to Isla Mujeres.",
      "What happened at the first Fyre Festival?",
      "McFarland also promised a luxury experience at the first Fyre fest, staged in Great Exuma, Bahamas, eight years ago, with Blink-182 and other musical acts expected to perform.",
      "Instead, most pass holders found that their accommodations consisted of unfinished tents and drenched mattresses, with cheese sandwiches for sustenance.",
      "McFarland, who was convicted of defrauding investors of more than $27 million, in 2018 was sentenced to six years in prison. He served four years and was released in 2022. His partner in the first festival, rapper Ja Rule, said the following year that he had been \"hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hoodwinked, led astray\" by the organizers.",

      "A representative for the estate of The Notorious B.I.G. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Notorious B.I.G., one of rap's greatest performers, was shot to death at age 24 in Los Angeles in 1997. The case remains unsolved. He was survived by his wife, the musician and actress Faith Evans, and his two children, Christopher Jordan Wallace and T'yanna Dream Wallace.",
      "Wallace was a dedicated keeper of her son's legacy, born Christopher Wallace. When he first emerged on the scene as one of rap's most distinctive talents with songs that expertly detailed street life in Brooklyn, she labeled his music \"noise.\"",
      "Since his death, his gift took on a new meaning for her. She told AP in 2017, 20 years after his death, \"I remembered my son said, 'Don't listen to my music.' And I never listened to his music. I heard it on the radio and it sounded good because it was clean. But I said, 'You know what, I have to. I have to listen to that music.' And that's what I did.\"",
      "\"I cried so much that day just listening to the music. I remember I sat, I stood. I rested my head on the stereo and I just cried like a baby. And that was therapy for me. And I said, 'Oh my God \u2014 that was a talented young man to put those words together.' He had a beautiful voice. I love his voice,\" she continued.",
      "Wallace launched the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation following her son's death, an organization that provides educational resources for children.

Night Out,\" a benefit for the foundation.",
      "\"It is our way of saying, 'Keep your head up,\"' Wallace told AP at the time. \"It's the foundation's way just to let these parents know that we love them.\"",
      "She also took legal action on behalf of her son. In 2004, she dropped a wrongful-death lawsuit against a former suspect in the rap star's slaying \u2014 Amir Muhammad, aka Harry Billups. The 2002 lawsuit also named the city of Los Angeles and Muhammad's former college roommate, David A. Mack, a Los Angeles policeman. It accused Mack of hiring Muhammad to shoot the hip-hop artist and police of failing to investigate properly after a fellow officer came under suspicion.",
      "In 2021, Wallace worked as an executive producer on the Netflix documentary \"Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell,\" and told AP about her role in the public eye.",
      "\"They never knew me. The public never knew me. I was thrust into this environment, I should say, after he passed away because I'm a very private person. Extremely private,\" she said. \"What he was doing out there, maybe I should have known. But honestly, I didn't. And to this day, there are people who are saying, 'Oh, she knew.'

      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",
      "\"And every network said, 'No. That's a crazy idea. We don't wanna do it,'\" said Probst. \"But Mark is not easily deterred. So, he went out and got sponsors for the entire show.\"",
      "At the time, Probst hosted music shows on cable TV (including VH1's \"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\"). \"I was literally the last person hired,\" he said. \"I heard Mark talking about 'Survivor' on a radio interview. And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control. And I know that I cannot come out here and do that.\"",
      "Kyle Fraser is a contestant from Roanoke, Virginia. \"When I first started watching 'Survivor,' I knew that this game was for me,\" he said.",

      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",
      "Each season films in the summer, with crews arriving months in advance, turning a resort into a production village.",
      "Roberta Limjap, who works in the art department, said, \"It's not only work, it's family.\"",
      "All of the materials, equipment and props are produced here. \"Everything is made from scratch,\" she said. \"You can't buy this.\"",
      "Dozens of young production assistants test every detail of the challenges while crews plot camera angles.",
      "I had my chance. And yes, it's much harder than it looks. And tribal members often compete exhausted and hungry. They are not fed when the cameras are off.",

    "title": "Gallery owner Larry Gagosian on the art world's \"blood sport\"",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 09:26:10 -0500",
    "summary": "With 18 galleries around the globe, he's been called \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\" Larry Gagosian talks about his estimated billion-dollar-a-year business and why, at age 79, he's still energized by the hustle.",
    "story": [
      "On any night, he can have art openings in Paris, in London, or at his flagship gallery in New York. With 18 galleries around the globe, Larry Gagosian has more exhibition space than most museums. His annual revenues are estimated at over a billion dollars, which (as The New Yorker put it) may make Gagosian \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\"",
      "In 2022, when Andy Warhol's \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" set an auction record for a 20th century artist at Christie's, the winning bidder was Larry Gagosian. The final price, with fees: $195 million.",
      "I asked, \"That must have been a crazy moment?\"",
      "\"When you're bidding at that level,\" Gagosian said, \"your adrenaline is \u2026 it's very exciting.\"",
      "\"It's a brutal business.\"",
      "\"It's a blood sport.\"",
      "\"What do you love about this most?\" I asked.",
      "\"I love the challenge,\" Gagosian smiled. \"I love winning.\"",
      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
    "story": [
      "As the year 2000 ushered in the new millennium, boy bands and pop stars dominated the music charts, and the International Space Station welcomed its first crew, while back on Earth, reality TV was forever changed by an inaugural group of castaways on the CBS show \"Survivor\" \u2014 all when more than 70% of Americans didn't own a cellphone and only half of U.S. households had a computer.",
      "Phil Salvador, library director for the Video Game History Foundation, reflected on this era of rapid technological growth.",
      "\"If you were playing especially computer games back then, you were probably playing on the family computer,\" Salvador  said.",
      "It was a time when gaming hardware was evolving, and titles like Halo and first-person shooters were on the rise. But one game development company, Maxis, was trying something different: simulation games, designed to replicate real-life activities.",
      "At the helm was legendary game designer Will Wright, who had a personal reason for exploring the genre.",
      "\"Will Wright actually lost his home in the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, and he had to start rebuilding his life, and that became the inspiration for his idea of Dollhouse,\" Salvador said.",
      "Initially a virtual construction game, Dollhouse failed to draw much interest. But when Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997, EA recognized the quirky potential of the game.",
      "Salvador noted that EA realized that people liked telling stories and interacting with the simulated people more than the game's original objective: to construct homes. It was around this time when EA changed the concept from Dollhouse to The Sims.",
      "The Sims spent nearly a decade in development, ultimately creating a digital space where players could control virtual beings, environments and life choices. When the game debuted in February 2000, it was unlike anything seen before.",
      "\"It is a game where you're helping people do chores around the house and use the toilet and things like that, and it's not the most immediately compelling game idea, but once people started seeing it hands-on, I think they realized there was something special happening there,\" Salvador said.",
      "Despite the competition from PlayStation 2 and Xbox, The Sims quickly became a cultural phenomenon. By 2002, it had become the best-selling PC game in history.",
      "\"It is \u2026 humbling to look back on all of the people that we've impacted,\" said Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, Technology and Central Development. \"Multiple generations of people grew up with The Sims.\"",
      "The franchise has redefined what it means to be a gamer, with women making up around 60% of the most recent game's player base. With over 500 million players, The Sims remains the largest brand in life-simulation games.",
      "Miele credits the game's successful longevity to it being an open canvas for creators to express themselves no matter their age.",
      "\"A player, whether you're 12 or 82, you can always be connected at the culture that you love through The Sims,\" Miele  said.",
      "The Sims continues to resonate with culture-makers too. This year, Grammy award winner Doja Cat joined The Sims' celebratory 25-hour livestream, as did Chappell Roan, the newly crowned best new artist who expressed interest in being Simmified, aiming to join the likes of the Black Eyed Peas and Glass Animals' Dave Bayley, who have recorded their songs in Simlish, the fictional language created for the game.",
      "\"Simlish was a brilliant, brilliant concept for The Sims, I have to say,\" said Rachel Franklin, EA's senior vice president and group general manager of lifestyle entertainment. \"What it does is it allows the player to be able to say, 'Hmm, I think they're saying this,' and allowing for choice and creativity and meaning that's directly connected to the player.\"",
      "Under Franklin's direction, The Sims 4 has become the most widely played title in the franchise, offering players unparalleled control over the customization of their Sims and their environments.",
      "\"We get stories all the time about how people, for example, they want to be an architect, and so they go and they play with building in The Sims, and that translates into, 'Hey, I was able to get my dream job as an architect because of all of that time I spent playing,'\" Franklin  said.",
      "\"There's also a lot of people that experiment with their own lives in The Sims, where some people will build a family, find what makes them happy through this cause and effect with these little people,\" she said. \"It's a safe space, and it's an optimistic universe. It's a place where, in the end, it all works out.\"",
      "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
      "\"In terms of importance, it is very close to the top of the list,\" said Salvador. \"When you think about games that really broke ground for what video games could be, you see, you know, Doom, which is the game, one of the first games that was a first-person shooter that really clicked on. You see something like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, obviously. The Sims deserves to be in that same conversation.\"",
      "And as to why the game is still relevant, Salvador said, \"Everybody brings a little of themselves into the game. Everyone gets something a little bit different out of it, far more than what the developers ever intended. How many games can say that?\"",

    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more. But the people who pronounce on 'Black people's poverty is self-inflicted 'cause they're too lazy or too irresponsible,' they're just wrong.\"",
      "At the end of the day, it got me thinking about my own family.\u00a0 My parents died in their 70s. Two siblings died in their early 60s \u2026 all of them much too soon.\u00a0 There were certain ailments \u2013 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure \u2013 that were expected almost, or that just kind of comes with the territory. And Wisdom says it shouldn't come with the territory \u2013 or that the reason it came with the territory was due to weathering.",
      "Wisdom said, \"Many people of color, families say that, 'Oh, we all get diabetes. We all get cancer. I mean, that's part of the natural course of life. That's the life course.' That is not the life course.\"",

      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations.

An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",

      "A listeria outbreak linked to recalled frozen supplemental nutrition shakes has infected 38 people, killing 12, according to an update on Monday from federal and state health officials.",
      "The infections, which ranged across 21 states, have been traced to recalled products manufactured by Prairie Farms Dairy at a facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Swabs collected from the plant's processing area tested positive for listeria, with the investigation ongoing, the Food and Drug Administration\u00a0stated\u00a0in a new alert.",
      "The following states have reported cases of listeria tied to the recalled shakes: Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.",

      "Of the 38 people for whom information is available, 37 have been hospitalized and 12 deaths have been reported as of Monday. The vast majority of those who were infected with listeria reported living in a long-term care facility or being hospitalized before becoming sick, the CDC said.",
      "The death toll linked to the Prairie Farms Dairy shakes is greater than one in 2024 connected to deli meats made by Boar's Head that resulted in 10 deaths and 57 illnesses in what was labeled the worst listeria outbreak since one in 2011 linked to cantaloupe.",
      "Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious, and sometimes fatal, infections in the young, frail or elderly, as well as in people with weakened immune systems.

      "McFarland, who was convicted of defrauding investors of more than $27 million, in 2018 was sentenced to six years in prison. He served four years and was released in 2022.

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long been Tesla's public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.",
      "Wall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk's political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of\u00a0Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don't appreciate Elon Musk's close relationship to President Trump and the administration's tariff policies,\" Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker's stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk's involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.",
      "The inextricable link between Musk, the world's richest person, and Tesla's brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company's fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world's biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world's most valuable businesses.",
      "But Musk's recent\u00a0inflammatory public statements\u00a0and his role leading Mr. Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk's political activities on the automaker.",
      "Customer dissatisfaction",
      "Among the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.",
      "\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"",
      "Oh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she's aligned with Musk's political opinions.",
      "\"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"",
      "Jake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk's evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.",
      "\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.",
      "But Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk's changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.",
      "\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the 'bro' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn't want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family's Model X.",
      "Asked if he'd ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He's now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.",
      "Musician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram\u00a0post\u00a0that she sold her vehicle because of Musk's recent political activities.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.",
      "Wall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk's reputation on the company's sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company's prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"",
      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",
      "Tesla's favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm's research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company's favorability rating stood at 33%.",
      "\"[M]any on the Street view Musk spending '100% of his time' with DOGE as creating a negative perception around his Tesla focus,\" Gengaro wrote in a research note.",
      "Partisan divide",
      "More than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.",
      "Those changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.",
      "In states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.",
      "In California, the country's largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla's cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January\u00a0report.",
      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla's sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.",

      "She said not all municipalities may allow you to keep chickens, explaining there could be restrictions on the location of the coop, number of birds and more.",
      "\"The best thing to do is to contact the code enforcement officer in your town to request information about any limitations that may exist with respect to the legalities on your property,\" Mormino said.",
      "Tips for saving on soaring costs",
      "Experts say the costs of raising chickens can quickly add up. A backyard hen in her prime can lay up to five eggs per week, but consumers need to consider the initial cost of the coop, chicks and feed, which could cost thousands of dollars. Meanwhile if you bought a dozen eggs per week at the grocery store, it would be about $300 per year.",
      "\"I always say that they're not just PEZ dispensers,\" Mormino said. \"So how many eggs they lay a week is going to depend on how healthy they are, how young they are, what the seasonal influences are.\"",
      "But there are some tips to save on eggs as prices continue to soar. Experts at Good Housekeeping suggest substituting a fourth cup of Greek yogurt in place of an egg while baking. Liquid left over from a can of chickpeas can also be added to recipes, or whipped into an aioli-like spread in place of mayonnaise.",
      "Bird flu impact",
      "The H5N1 strain of the bird flu has been spreading since 2022. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's impacted more than 162 million birds across the country.",
      "Mormino said bird flu is a big concern for flocks at home.",
      "\"Bird flu is distributed primarily by migratory waterfowl so they're droppings and other secretions are infected by the virus,\" Mormino explained. \"All you have to do is walk through duck poop at a pond in the local park and now you're carrying bird flu on your shoes, wherever you're going.\"",
      "She added the concern is true for wildlife as well.",
      "\"So all it takes is a mouse to walk through infected droppings from waterfowl that is a carrier and bring it into your backyard. ... But there are certain biosecurity measures that you can take and should be taking as a backyard 'chickeneer' with the prevalence of bird flu.\"",
      "At least 70 people have been affected by the bird flu, and one fatality has been reported. Human cases have been spread through dairy cattle, poultry farms and other animals, CDC data shows.",
      "Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was trying to rehire some of its employees who were fired as part of major cuts made by the Trump administration based on recommendations from Elon Musk's Department of Efficiency, or DOGE. The USDA employees were experts working to combat the bird flu.",
      "\"Although several positions supporting [highly pathogenic avian influenza] were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\" the USDA said in a statement to CBS News.",

    "summary": "Tax accountants urge Americans to file early this year to avoid delays in getting your 2025 tax refund.",
    "story": [
      "Tax filing season is upon us, and some people are worried it may take longer to get their refunds as President Trump says he intends to make\u00a0significant cuts\u00a0to the IRS during its busy period.",
      "Tax experts say these concerns are valid and that it's more important than ever to file early this year, as Americans could encounter tax refund delays, particularly as they get closer to the filing deadline. The Internal Revenue Service began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15, unless a taxpayer asks for an extension.",
      "Mr. Trump is\u00a0expected to fire more than 6,000\u00a0IRS employees by the end of this week, as he doubles down on efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Tax accountant Terrance Hutchins, of Logos Financial Group, said taxpayers should expect longer hold times over the phone and slower customer service in general. He still expends refunds on relatively straightforward returns that are filed early and electronically, though, to appear in a timely manner.",
      "But many taxpayers could experience processing delays as a result of the anticipated cuts.",
      "\"Your refund can be very fast indeed if you receive it by direct deposit, but those promises were made a few weeks ago before the agency knew of the cuts, so it's very hard to say what the impact will be,\" Vanessa Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Will the IRS cuts affect how long it takes to get my refund?",
      "Tax accountants say the advice they always give taxpayers \u2014 which is to file their returns early \u2014 is even more important this year, in light of the anticipated workforce reduction. If the IRS' headcount is reduced, any errors on one's tax return will take longer to remedy.",
      "If taxpayers file close to the deadline or make mistakes in their returns, Hutchins expects a reduced workforce at the agency would lead to one's refund being delayed.",
      "Williams of the Tax Policy Center, said filers in need of assistance should expect slower refunds as a result of long wait times and worse customer service.\u00a0 \"You spend a lot of time on hold, and there are real consequences,\" she said, recalling the 2010s when the IRS was understaffed.",
      "Democratic Senators warned in a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday that potential staff cuts could lead to delayed tax refunds for Americans in 2025.",
      "\"Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement effort,\" the senators wrote. It's essential that the agency responsible for processing refunds be fully staffed to support Americans through tax season and \"answer their questions, process their returns, send them refunds and keep IRS systems online and functional.\"",
      "\"I always advise people to do their taxes as early as they can, partly because hackers can get their social security numbers and file false tax returns,\" Katie Brewer, a Texas-based financial adviser told CBS MoneyWatch. Brewer also expects cuts to lead to longer wait times to have tax-related questions answered by phone, a particularly burdensome for older filers, who aren't as tech savvy and might not be inclined to turn to the IRS' website for advice, she added.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "The IRS says that most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days, if you file your taxes electronically. It can take longer to get a refund on paper returns.",
      "Taxpayers filing electronically can view the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund? tool.",
      "Returns that require corrections or extra review could result in a delayed refund, the IRS notes. That's why Brewer says it's extra important to ensure that there are no errors on your return.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't double check things until after they hit send. But I really encourage to make sure not to mix up any numbers or accidentally add a zero because those are the kinds of things that hinder refunds or make it hard to deal with the IRS to correct them,\" Brewer said.",
      "Who counts on timely refunds?",
      "Millions of Americans count on receiving their refunds in a timely manner, so that they can repay debt, put money into savings, or make a big purchase.",
      "\"Particularly for working families who receive a child tax credit, or the earned income tax credit, these are often essential supports for Americans,\" Williams said. \"Low-income people use their tax refunds to pay off their winter heating bills, or to put money aside to cover spring clothes for their kids.\"",
      "She added that working-class Americans rely on their tax credits for financial stability. \"That's the purpose. To give people stability when they are working and have kids,\" she said. \"It's not a spare $20 someone might be excited to receive as gift or surprise. It's real money that underwrites the economic security of a very large number of Americans.\"",
      "The IRS last year piloted a new, free electronic service called Direct File, that provides public tax preparation services. It's currently available to 30 million Americans in 25 states, and pulls one's personal tax filing information directly from the IRS. Using such a service is one way to increase one's chances of receiving a refund in a timely manner, according to Williams.",
      "Why haven't I received my tax refund yet?",
      "The IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool will tell electronic filers what the status of their 2025 tax refund is 24 hours after they file a return, according to the agency's website. Those filing by mail can view the status of their refund four weeks after they mail in their return.",
      "To use the tool, taxpayers need to enter their Social Security number, or ITIN, their filing status and exact dollar amount of their refund rounded to the nearest whole number.",

      "Stocks tumbled on Friday after weaker-than-expected economic reports suggested that President Trump's policies could be impacting U.S. business activity, while consumer sentiment dropped to a 15-month low.",
      "Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% on Friday, marking their worst one-day declines since December 18, according to financial data firm FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.2%.",
      "A preliminary report from S&P Global found U.S. business activity is nearing stall-speed, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. Activity for U.S. services businesses unexpectedly shrank, and many businesses in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about policies from the Trump administration, including the potential for new tariffs and domestic spending cuts.",
      "\"Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.\"",
      "Inflation worries also weighed on the stock market, with a University of Michigan survey finding that consumers are preparing for higher inflation due to potential tariffs. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, such as retailers such as Walmart, the costs are often passed onto consumers, raising prices.",
      "Consumers say they are broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from last month's forecast of 3.3% inflation, the University of Michigan survey found. That fits with preliminary data the survey suggested earlier, though a divide is evident underneath the surface.",
      "Expectations for inflation are rising for political independents and Democrats, while falling slightly for Republicans.",

      "Walmart, Akamai",
      "Other corporate reports have added to the sense of unease on Wall Street, including Walmart's most recent earnings report. The retailing giant on Thursday provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart shares slipped 2.5% on Friday, following a 6.5% decline on the prior day.",
      "\"With policy uncertainty and weaker retail sales guidance yesterday from consumer spending bellwether Walmart, we may have the catalyst we need for a healthy correction,\" noted Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.",
      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 20.6% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts' expectations.",
      "Even within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, roughly 4 out of every 5 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies fell. Nvidia sank 2.5%. United Airlines lost 5.5%, and Newmont Mining fell 4.4%.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday's reports together raise concerns about what's been a remarkably resilient economy, and the ensuing losses on Wall Street were widespread.",
      "Before Friday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That worked against worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",

      "The call to action \u2014 or rather inaction \u2014 is asking that American consumers refrain from making any purchases at major retailers on Friday, February 28. The protest comes as people continue to endure\u00a0rising prices on everything from food and gas to housing and utilities, epitomized by the soaring cost of eggs which in January\u00a0averaged $4.95 a dozen.",
      "Behind the boycott is a group called The People's Union USA, a self-described grassroots organization founded by John Schwarz, a 57-year-old dad originally from Queens, New York, who has been promoting the consumer blackout for weeks on social media. The People's Union says it has no political affiliation, but focuses on \"fairness, economic justice and real systemic change.\"",

However, official messaging from The People's Union suggests a boycott of all major retailers, with the goal of enacting broader economic change.",
      "\"For our entire lives, they have told us we have no choice ... that we have to accept these insane prices, the corporate greed, the billionaire tax breaks, all while we struggle to just to get by,\" Schwarz said in a video posted to his Instagram account. \"February 28, the 24-hour economic blackout: no Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas, not a single unnecessary dollar spent ... for one day, we are going to finally turn the tables.\"",

      "Will the Feb. 28 blackout make an impact?",
      "Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, contributing almost 70% of GDP, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But some critics say that halting spending for a single day isn't likely to make much impact on major retailers.",

      "But, he added, the economic blackout could become bigger, snowballing into more events across the U.S. The People's Union is planning additional blackouts aimed at specific retailers, such as an event from March 7-14 to halt spending at Amazon.",
      "Schwarz expresses optimism in his videos that the economic blackout could make an impact. \"If a million people on the 28th do not spend a dime, you might not think out of 360 million people in this country that's a lot, but a million people all on one day not spending their money, that is a hit,\" he said.",

Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold's book value is $42.22 per ounce.",
      "The depository is very secure. The actual structure and content of the facility is known by only a few, and no one person knows all the procedures to open the vault.",
      "What is known publicly is that the facility was built in 1936 using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. The facility is heavily guarded and has broken its strict policy of not allowing visitors only three times.",
      "In 1974, the US Mint opened the vaults to a group of journalists and a congressional delegation so they could see the gold reserves. The Treasury secretary allowed the visit after persistent rumors that the gold had been removed. Until then, the only person other than authorized personnel to access the vaults was President Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "Since then, the vaults have been opened one other time: In 2017, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited with Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he would happily arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested in seeing the vaults.",
      "The gold depository at Fort Knox has a reputation for being impenetrable, which has gained it a place in popular culture. As early as 1952, a Looney Tunes cartoon featured Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam digging for gold in Fort Knox. Fort Knox has also been featured in the plot of movies such as the 1964 James Bond spy thriller \"Goldfinger\" and the 1981 comedy \"Stripes,\" which was partially filmed at the post.",

    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 08:34:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day Kennedy was sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

More than half of these employees \u2014 over 3,500 \u2014 are expected to be from just one division at the IRS, according to text of an email obtained by CBS News and shared by an IRS employee.",
      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "According to an email sent to IRS managers in one division Thursday morning, probationary employees terminated were supposed to receive these emails by 12 p.m. ET. Managers were not copied on these emails, but CBS News obtained a copy of the termination memo.",
      "The guidance said all separation actions will be final Thursday. Terminated employees are to be paid for a full day Thursday, and the guidance says \"administrative leave will cover the balance of the day after they depart.\" Federal probationary employees who have worked for under a year are not entitled to severance.",
      "Managers were instructed to inform any employees who planned to be on leave on Thursday that their leave was canceled and they were to report to the office with their equipment.

      "The IRS is carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS. Managers in the IRS Large Business & International Division also received an email that asked them to come into the office Thursday and Friday \"to support offboarding activities.\" It did not specify a number of employees that could be terminated.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to the IRS and White House for comment.",
      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",
      "\"IT will be available to help secure equipment. If IT is not available, managers will secure equipment,\" the email to SBSE managers reads. It adds that there will be a guide and FAQ guide \"to help guide managers through this difficult process.\"",
      "Some LB&I employees were also called and emailed Wednesday to be summoned to the office later this week and were told to bring any government-issued equipment with them, like access cards and paper case files.",

We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House.

    "title": "Trump says he'll consider DOGE dividend checks. Experts are dubious.",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\" Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk had claimed that DOGE found evidence of 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, reiterated the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the statement acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "In the statement, Dudek added that the agency's priority continues to be \"paying beneficiaries the right amount at the right time, and providing other critical services people rely on from us.\"",
      "He noted that DOGE personnel \"CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\"",
      "\"I am confident that with DOGE's help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\" Dudek said.",
      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",

      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\"A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\" she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration's whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\"",

    "summary": "Ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an uncommon style of giving that has brought meaningful change to charities, a new report finds.",
    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is aiming to vote Tuesday on a budget proposal that would enact trillions of dollars in spending reductions and tax cuts key to President Trump's agenda. But the timing and outcome remained unclear after Speaker Mike Johnson met with his conference in the morning, with handful of members expressing their opposition.",
      "The House Rules Committee advanced the measure Monday night and Johnson had hoped to bring it to the floor Tuesday. But it did not appear that Johnson had won over every Republican he needs to pass the measure after the House Republican Conference met Tuesday morning. Still, Johnson said the House would move forward.",
      "\"We're planning to take up our budget resolution as early as today,\" Johnson said at a news conference following the GOP meeting.",
      "\"There may be a vote tonight, there may not be,\" he said later.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has been racing to move forward with the budget resolution, a crucial step in the budget reconciliation process that Republicans plan to use to enact Mr. Trump's priorities on border security, energy and taxes. After delays due to House Republican infighting, Senate Republicans moved forward with a competing plan earlier this month. But Johnson won a key victory last week when Mr. Trump endorsed his chamber's budget outline.",
      "Still, whether Johnson and his leadership team can rally House Republicans around the budget plan is an open question. And Johnson acknowledged that the math may not be in his favor just yet.",
      "\"There's always more work to do right up to the end for a big vote like this and this is a big one,\"  Johnson said. \"We're very, very close.\"",
      "With a 218-215 majority, Johnson can afford to lose just one vote if all members are present and voting. He told reporters Monday that he had spoken with one holdout, Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana, and had left a voicemail for another, Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky.",
      "But that evening, Massie posted on X, \"If the Republican budget passes, the deficit gets worse, not better.\" Elon Musk replied, \"That sounds bad.\" Then, Spartz, who has already pledged to oppose the budget bill, answered Massie, writing: \"The situation is much worse than it sounds @RepThomasMassie and @elonmusk - we are going to accumulate $24T of additional debt on top of $36T we already have \u2026 reaching $60 TRILLION!\"",
      "Additionally, Rep. Tim Burchett also told reporters Monday night he's a no \"right now\" on the budget resolution, and indicated spending remains his big concern. After the Republican conference met Tuesday morning, the Tennessee Republican said he was still a no.",
      "House Democrats widely oppose the measure, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote a letter to his caucus on Monday telling them \"it's imperative that we are present with maximum attendance.\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, instructed lawmakers to appear on the Capitol steps Tuesday afternoon to demonstrate their opposition to what he called a \"budget scheme that betrays hardworking American families.\"",
      "The House GOP budget plan includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back in an amendment to the resolution that was made to appease conservatives.",
      "The resolution tasks relevant committees with finding billions of dollars in cuts, some of which could target Medicaid, which has prompted concern among some Republicans, especially in swing districts.",
      "GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, was among the Republicans worried about Medicaid cuts, but she met with Johnson Monday and said he assured her that Medicaid recipients would not removed from the rolls \"unless they are not fulfilling the work requirements, and they're not citizens.\"",
      "House Republican leadership refuted the Medicaid concerns on Tuesday, arguing that the GOP shouldn't believe what they say is a Democratic talking point. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer urged that the budget resolution \"merely unlocks the opportunity for committees to begin drafting legislation,\" calling it a \"blueprint to save America.\" And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that the vote is simply one to begin the reconciliation process.",
      "Still, Johnson wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" Johnson said, when asked whether there could be cuts to the program down the line. \"What we're talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "The developments come after the Senate adopted its budget late last week, while the House was away on recess. Since Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House resolution, Senate Republicans have billed their own budget plan as a backup. The Senate plan would divide the reconciliation process into two bills, with the first aimed at quickly delivering resources for border security and defense, while a later bill would tackle the tax priorities. Senate Republicans also want to make the tax cuts permanent, which the House version does not do.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:58:58 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip\u200b, an Oklahoma death row inmate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma death row inmate who was joined in his bid to have his conviction thrown out by the state's Republican attorney general.",
      "The high court ruled\u00a05-3 in favor of Glossip and reversed a decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that upheld his conviction and death sentence. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for the court and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the court's consideration of the case.",
      "After first finding that the high court has jurisdiction to review the Oklahoma court's decision, Sotomayor wrote that the prosecution's failure to correct testimony of their key witness during the trial violated Glossip's right to due process, entitling him to a new trial.",
      "\"Turning to the merits, we conclude that the prosecution violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony,\" she wrote.",
      "It will now be up to Oklahoma prosecutors to determine how to proceed.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the majority's finding as to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, but said she would not order the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip's conviction. Instead, she said would have sent the case back for more proceedings.",
      "In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court lacks the power to override the decisions of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which declined to grant Glossip clemency in 2023.",
      "\"The court's decision distorts our jurisdiction, imagines a constitutional violation where none occurred, and abandons basic principles governing the disposition of state-court appeals,\" Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito.",
      "The Glossip case",
      "Glossip was convicted in the 1997 murder of the owner of the Oklahoma City motel where he worked and was sentenced to death more than two decades ago. Since then, he has seen nine execution dates come and go, and eaten his \"last meal\" three times.",
      "Glossip had also been before the Supreme Court once before, in 2015, when he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's method of execution on Eighth Amendment grounds.",
      "In the latest challenge, his bid to toss out his conviction and grant him a new trial was backed by Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, because of errors committed during his earlier trial.",
      "A central issue in the court fight involved the testimony of Glossip's co-defendant, Justin Sneed, who claimed Glossip paid him $10,000 to kill Barry Van Treese, the motel owner.",
      "Sneed admitted to robbing and bludgeoning Van Treese and is serving a sentence of life in prison. Glossip, meanwhile, has said he was not involved in the murder and repeatedly maintained his innocence over his roughly 25 years on death row.",
      "Glossip's first conviction was overturned because of ineffective assistance of counsel. During his second trial, Sneed told prosecutors that he had never seen a psychiatrist, but was given lithium after he was arrested. But in 2022, the state found prosecutors' handwritten notes in a banker's box, which Drummond said called into question Sneed's credibility as a witness.",
      "Lawyers for Glossip and Drummond argued the notes showed that Sneed told prosecutors he was given lithium after seeing a jailhouse psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But neither his diagnosis nor his treatment by the psychiatrist were disclosed to Glossip's defense team, which Drummond said indicated prosecutors elicited false testimony on the matter.",
      "Following the revelations, Oklahoma's attorney general disclosed the box's materials to Glossip and had an independent counsel review the case. That examination, conducted by former district attorney Rex Duncan, ended in April 2023 and concluded that Glossip was deprived of a fair trial.",
      "The state asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to toss out Glossip's conviction and sentence, arguing that the errors committed during the trial rendered both flaws. But the court denied relief and ordered the state to move forward with executing Glossip. A request for clemency to the Oklahoma Parole and Pardon Board, which Drummond supported, was also unsuccessful after it deadlocked 2-2.",
      "Glossip and Drummond then urged the Supreme Court to step in. The court in May 2023 agreed to pause his execution and months later agreed to hear his case. Gorsuch did not participate in the proceedings, likely because of earlier involvement when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Oklahoma.",
      "Arguments in the case took place in early October at the start of the Supreme Court's new term. Many of the questions focused on the interpretation of prosecutors' notes, as well as how the jury's view of the case would have been impacted had they known Sneed was prescribed lithium by a psychiatrist after his arrest.",
      "Writing for the majority, Sotomayor said the jury's assessment of Sneed's credibility was determinative.",
      "\"Had the prosecution corrected Sneed on the stand, his credibility plainly would have suffered,\" she wrote. \"That correction would have revealed to the jury not just that Sneed was untrustworthy ... but also that Sneed was willing to lie to them under oath. Such a revelation would be significant in any case, and was especially so here where Sneed was already 'nobody's idea of a strong witness.'\"",
      "The court found that even though Sneed's bipolar disorder was irrelevant, \"his willingness to lie about it to the jury was not.\"",
      "But writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of \"having bent the law at every turn to grant relief\" to Glossip, and said the court had no authority to order a new trial.",
      "As to Sneed's credibility, Thomas wrote that \"there is no reason to think\" that disclosing his bipolar disorder would have affected the outcome of the trial.",
      "\"The court stretches the law at every turn to rule in [Glossip's] favor,\" Thomas wrote. \"At the threshold, it concocts federal jurisdiction by misreading the decision below. On the merits, it finds a due process violation based on patently immaterial testimony about a witness's medical condition. And, for the remedy, it orders a new trial in violation of black-letter law on this Court's power to review state-court judgments.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",
      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk told federal workers Monday evening that they had \"another chance\" to justify their work or lose their jobs. The original deadline for them to comply passed later on Monday. Employees at multiple federal agencies had been told to disregard his initial directive.",
      "Musk, the world's richest person, a close adviser to President Trump and his biggest campaign donor, had originally given federal government employees until the end of Monday to send an email explaining their work achievements.",
      "His new directive represents the latest challenge from Musk to government workers as the White House's newly-created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which he heads, works toward reducing federal staffing and spending.",
      "\"Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,\" Musk said\u00a0Monday evening on X, which he owns. \"Failure to respond a second time will result in termination,\" he added, without providing a new deadline.",
      "There was no word on how many federal workers complied with the original one.",
      "The first time Musk mentioned the demand to describe their work last week on X, the Office of Personnel Management sent a mass email Saturday outlining the directive. His order Monday evening was not followed by an OPM email, so government workers who are not on X may not have seen his latest message.",
      "The first deadline came and went, causing confusion among an already anxious workforce after several federal agencies \u2014 including some led by prominent Trump loyalists \u2014 instructed staff to ignore the email, at least temporarily.",
      "Among them were the\u00a0Justice Department, the FBI, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Others, including the Transportation Department, the Education Department and the Department of Commerce and the National Transportation Safety Board, told their workers they should comply.",
      "The office that had instructed federal workers to document five things they\u00a0accomplished over the past week\u00a0told executive branch officials Monday that individual agencies could decide how to respond, despite Musk's threat.",
      "Two officials told CBS News that OPM \u2014 in essence, the government's human resources agency \u2014 held a call with personnel officials at federal agencies and said it's up to each one to determine how they want to handle the directive employees received Saturday.",
      "DOGE has faced increasing resistance on multiple fronts to its cost-cutting campaign, including court rulings and some pressure from lawmakers.",
      "More than two million federal employees received the email from OPM setting the Monday night deadline for them to submit \"approximately 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.\"",
      "The message followed a Musk post on X that \"all federal workers\" would receive the email and that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"",
      "As confusion over what to make of the threat spread, Mr. Trump defended Musk's Saturday message, calling it \"ingenious\" as it would expose whether \"people are working.\"",
      "\"If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "Non-responders would be \"sort of semi-fired\" or fired, the president added without explaining his thinking further.",
      "Musk on Monday said Saturday's email \"was basically a check to see if the employee had a pulse and was capable of replying to an email.\"",
      "\"This mess will get sorted out this week. Lot of people in for a rude awakening and strong dose of reality. They don't get it yet, but they will,\" he added on X.",
      "Unions quickly opposed Musk's request, with the largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), vowing to challenge any unlawful terminations.",
      "Concern has begun to emerge on Capitol Hill from Mr. Trump's own Republican party, which controls both the House and the Senate.",

    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy said in\u00a0a post\u00a0on X in November that \"Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.\"",
      "Dental experts largely disagree.",
      "Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0in\u00a0November there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years, showing that fluoride is both safe and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids' intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",

      "\"I don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\" Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \"This isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\"",

      "A group of workers at California national park positioned the U.S. flag on Saturday near the Horsetail Fall, an area where crowds of nature enthusiasts and photographers typically gather to witness Yosemite's annual firefall.",
      "The upside-down flag - or \"distress flag\" - is meant to also bring attention to\u00a0Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's orders that potentially open federal lands and waters to drilling and mining interests, the group of park staffers told San Francisco Chronicle, who first reported on the protest.",
      "On the first day of his new term in office, President Trump declared a national energy emergency and\u00a0pledged to \"drill, baby, drill\"\u00a0the country's natural resources. Environment advocates like the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group that helped pass the 1972 Clean Water Act, say they're worried the Trump administration's energy and climate policies could \"lead to profound harms to public lands and waters across the country.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:08:50 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Maryland blocked the Trump administration from carrying out immigration enforcement actions at places of worship for three religious groups.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland blocked the Trump administration on Monday from carrying out immigration enforcement actions at certain places of worship for Quakers, Cooperative Baptists and Sikhs, who filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's unwinding of a Biden-era memo that barred immigration arrests at certain protected locations.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang granted a request for a narrow preliminary injunction sought by the religious groups as they pursue their challenge to Mr. Trump's directive allowing federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement actions at places of worship. Chuang's order does not block the administration's policy nationwide, and only applies to houses of worship owned or used by the challengers \u2014 the Quakers, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Sikh Temple.",
      "The groups had argued that the new policy allowing immigration arrests at places that were previously considered protected violates their First Amendment rights and burdens the free exercise of religion under federal law.",
      "Chuang, appointed by President Barack Obama, found that the threat of enforcement action at houses of worship attended by the three religious communities has caused reductions in attendance by not only immigrants who are in the country illegally, but also by those with legal status who fear they may be mistaken for unauthorized immigrants. The court concluded that the new policy from the Trump administration likely violates the faith groups' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment.",
      "\"Where plaintiffs' communal religious exercise will be significantly and adversely affected by reductions in attendance resulting from immigration enforcement actions pursuant to the 2025 policy, armed law enforcement officers operating in or at places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy will adversely affect the ability of Quakers and Sikhs to follow their religious beliefs or worship freely,\" Chuang wrote in a 59-page opinion.",
      "The court found that the 2025 policy imposes a substantial burden on the groups' exercise of religion in relation to their communal worship and the Cooperative Baptists' immigrant-focused services.",
      "\"Immigration enforcement actions at plaintiffs' places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy would impose substantial pressure on plaintiffs' to modify their behavior by preventing them from worshipping with a larger and more diverse group of congregants and thereby inhibiting their exercise of central facets of their respective religions,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He said that because the new directive from the Trump administration has already caused a decline in attendance at communal worship, it \"effectively compels\" the religious groups to worship with a smaller congregation and with fewer immigrants, \"even though their beliefs call for worship with as large and diverse a community as possible.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have thus shown that religious exercise is being hindered by the 2025 policy for entire congregations, including United States citizens and immigrants with legal status, whose ability to worship is undermined by such reduced participation,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate a 2021 memorandum from then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that barred the department and its components from taking enforcement action in certain places that \"require special protection,\" including schools, medical facilities or places of worship. That memo said immigration enforcement action should not be undertaken at houses of worship \"to the fullest extent possible.\"",
      "The court's order requires the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Trump to abide by the terms of the 2021 memo when pursuing enforcement actions at the three faith communities' places of worship.",
      "Chuang's order does not prevent the Trump administration from conducting arrests in or near places of worship when authorized by a warrant.",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the religious groups, said they are grateful to the court for limiting the policy.",
      "\"For decades, the government has recognized that everyone \u2014 no matter their immigration status \u2014 should be able to attend houses of worship without fear of a warrantless government raid. Religious institutions should not have to go to court to fight for the right to worship and associate freely that is enshrined in our Constitution,\" she said in a statement in response to\u00a0the court's decision.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive revoking the Biden administration's memo\u00a0was issued on his first day in office as part of a series of executive actions aimed at cracking down on immigration. The Trump administration replaced it with a directive stating that \"it is not necessary\" to \"create bright line rules regarding where our immigration laws are permitted to be enforced.\"",
      "A press release from the Department of Homeland Security further stated that \"criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "The Quakers are comprised of six different meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. The Religious Society of Friends has practiced the Quaker faith in the U.S. since the 1600s, and \"yearly meetings\" are its highest organizational bodies. The group has argued that the communal aspect of its worship is key to the exercise of the Quaker faith.",
      "The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship is a network of churches, worshippers and partners that includes more than 1,400 congregations. Its congregations operate in 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Many congregations have a large number of immigrants as members, according to court filings, and some of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship's congregations are engaged in ministry focused on immigrants and refugees.",
      "The Sikh Temple is a place of worship for the Sikh population near Sacramento, California, which is made up of roughly 30,000 people. Roughly half of its congregation consist of immigrants, according to court papers.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The United States failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression.",
    "story": [
      "In a win for Ukraine as it marks\u00a0three years since Russia's full-scale invasion, the United States on Monday failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression. And the assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine.",
      "It marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That's lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia's aggression.",
      "The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.",
      "The vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting \"yes,\" the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting \"no.\"",
      "Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its \"inherent right to self-defense\" following Russia's invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter's requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.",
      "\"As we mark three years of this devastation \u2014 Russia's full invasion against Ukraine \u2014 we call on all nations to stand firm and to take \u2026 the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,\" she said.",
      "U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.\"",
      "\"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Shea said.",
      "The dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration's extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.",
      "In escalating rhetoric, Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast\" to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Mr. Trump was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space.\"",
      "Since then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine's U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Mr. Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.",
      "The U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.",
      "The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia's veto power.",
      "There are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.",
      "Since Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow's invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.",
      "The votes on the rival resolutions \u2014 which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said \u2014 will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Mr. Trump's effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.",
      "The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" and \"implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\" It never mentions Moscow's invasion.",
      "Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was \"a good move.\"",
      "The Ukraine's resolution, meanwhile, refers to \"the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\" and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions \"adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.\"",
      "It singles out the assembly's demand that Russia \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\"",
      "It stresses that any involvement of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia's forces \"raises serious concerns regarding further escalation of this conflict.\"",
      "The resolution reaffirms the assembly's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and also \"that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.\"",
      "It calls for \"a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine\" and it reiterates \"the urgent need to end the war this year.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court turned away two appeals asking the justices to overrule a 25-year-old decision that allowed for buffer zones around abortion clinics.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away two appeals from abortion rights opponents asking the justices to overrule a 25-year-old decision that allowed for buffer zones around abortion clinics, leaving that ruling in place.",
      "In declining to wade into the court fight, the justices will not add a second abortion-related case\u00a0to their current docket, following two terms in which the issue was before them. Last June, the court rebuffed two separate challenges involving abortion \u2014 the first over access to a popular pill used in medication abortions, and the second over how Idaho's near-total ban on the procedure interacts with a federal emergency care law.",
      "In June 2022, the court's conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade. Citing that landmark decision, anti-abortion rights groups had called on the Supreme Court to reverse its 2000 ruling in the case Hill v. Colorado, which involved buffer zones outside facilities to perform abortions.",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the requests to hear the cases. In a dissent from the Supreme Court's denial of the appeal in one of those disputes, involving an ordinance passed by the city council in Carbondale, Illinois, Thomas said the high court should make clear that its 2000 decision \"lacks continuing force\" and should be explicitly overturned.",
      "The decision in Hill v. Colorado \"has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,\" he wrote.",
      "The ordinance enacted in Carbondale came just six months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority rolled back the constitutional right to abortion. Known as the \"Disorderly Conduct Ordinance,\" the restriction was put in place in response to the high court's ruling, as reproductive health care clinics in the city reported an uptick of threats and acts of intimidation by people protesting abortion access.",
      "Illinois law protects the right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood opened a new facility in Carbondale in December 2023 as the state saw a spike in patients seeking abortion care from neighboring states that restricted abortion after Roe's reversal. Two other clinics were also opened in the city, which is located in southern Illinois near the Missouri border.",
      "Carbondale's measure created a 100-foot buffer zone around the entrance to health care facilities. Activists were prohibited from coming within eight feet of a person to give them a \"leaflet or handbill,\" display a sign or engage in \"oral protest, education or counseling\" inside the perimeter.",
      "The ordinance took effect in January 2023 but was repealed several months later. The Carbondale City Council said it had not been enforced against any potential violator.",
      "Before the measure was rolled back, the Missouri-based group Coalition Life challenged it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. Coalition Life organizes sidewalk counselors who seek to provide information and assistance to women approaching abortion clinics, including alternatives to terminating their pregnancies.",
      "The group has said their goal is to speak to the patients one-on-one and they believe it's necessary to get close to them \"so they can make eye-contact and speak from a normal conversational distance in a friendly and gentle manner.\" Carbondale's ordinance, however, hindered their ability to do so.",
      "A federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit agreed to dismiss the case, citing the Supreme Court's 2000 decision in the case Hill v. Colorado. The decision upheld a state law that barred activists from coming closer than eight feet of a person entering an abortion clinic to engage in protest, counseling or education unless they obtained their permission.",
      "The court has heard one other case involving buffer zones outside of abortion clinics since its ruling nearly 25\u00a0years ago. In 2014, the high court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that established a 35-foot buffer zone around medical facilities where abortions are performed. The law exempted four categories of people: those entering or exiting the facility; employees; law enforcement or other public workers; and people using the public sidewalk or right-of-way covered by the buffer zone to get to another destination.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in 2000, its makeup has shifted significantly. Conservatives now hold a 6-3 majority, and only one of the justices who heard that case, Thomas, is still on the bench. He joined the late Justice Antonin Scalia and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy in dissent.",

      "Responding to a journalist's question on whether he'd trade his office for peace, Zelenskyy said, \"I can trade it for NATO.\"",
      "His comment appeared to be aimed at recent suggestions by President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that elections should be held in Ukraine despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 strike drones into Ukraine overnight on Saturday, more than in any other single attack of the war.",
      "Ukraine's air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets.",
      "Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration.",
      "The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under Mr. Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.",
      "Mr. Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Mr. Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.",

      "Ukrainian officials on Sunday discussed a deal that would allow the U.S. to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal that the Trump administration is pushing for but that Zelenskyy earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees.",
      "At the forum in Kyiv where Zelenskyy made the offer to give up his presidency in return for peace and NATO membership, his chief of staff Andrii Yermak said the government was considering investment opportunities both with the U.S and European countries \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction.\"",
      "Yermak left the forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what he said were talks with U.S. representatives on a potential deal. He said Ukraine's mineral resources represent \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Yermak pushed back on the notion that Ukraine had rejected U.S. proposals but said any agreement \"must meet the national interests of Ukraine, and undoubtedly, must be interesting to our partners.\"",
      "Before leaving the forum, Svyrydenko said there are $350 billion worth of minerals on Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia. This calculation, however, is partly based on geological maps dating back to 1940s and 1960s, she said, adding: \"We have to conduct geological exploration and confirm the deposits we have on paper.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 07:27:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over funding for federal safety net programs may lead some state officials to turn to opioid settlement dollars to make up the difference.",
    "story": [
      "At a recent Nevada legislative committee hearing, lawmakers faced off with members of the governor's administration over how to fill gaping holes in the state's upcoming budget.",
      "At issue: whether opioid settlement money \u2014 paid by health care companies that were sued for fueling the opioid crisis and meant to help states abate addiction \u2014 should be funneled to two counties for a safety net program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which is aimed at helping low-income children and families.",
      "Previous funding \"will no longer be available after June 30, 2025,\" the budget proposal says. By then, billions of dollars in covid-era relief from the federal government \u2014 including a set-aside for TANF, which can cover emergency aid, job training, child care, and more \u2014 is likely to have expired.",
      "Recognizing both the need for and uptake of this assistance, Gov. Joe Lombardo's budget proposal directs $5 million in opioid settlement cash to shore up the program in the state's most populous counties, Clark and Washoe.",
      "The prospect of such tradeoffs is smacking many states in the face as they embark on budget season.",
      "Not only is the river of federal pandemic relief that flowed to public health, education, food assistance, child care, and more over the past few years drying up, but a deluge of actions from the Trump administration has thrown into question once-reliable federal funding for a myriad of social services and health care programs. Congressional Republicans have also threatened cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for many low-income people.",
      "Together, these financial headwinds have left many states hunting for alternative funds to maintain crucial services.",
      "Opioid settlement money can seem like an attractive option. More than $10 billion has landed in state and local government coffers in recent years and billions more are set to arrive over the next decade-plus.",
      "But recovery advocates, family members who have lost loved ones to addiction, and legal experts say that money has a specific purpose: to address the ongoing addiction and overdose crisis.",
      "Even if $5 million is a small portion of the hundreds of millions Nevada has received, some say spending it elsewhere sets a troubling precedent. Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a Democrat, raised this concern at the February hearing.",
      "\"There doesn't seem to be a direct link to opioids\" in the governor's proposal directing these dollars to TANF, he said. Settlement money should not be used \"to backfill budget accounts.\"",
      "Richard Whitley, director of the state's Department of Health and Human Services, insisted at the hearing that this was an appropriate use of settlement dollars. The money flowing through TANF will help \"relatives who are raising children whose parents are substance-abusing,\" he said.",
      "In addition, Elizabeth Ray, a spokesperson for the Republican governor, told KFF Health News that the money would help families at risk of losing custody of their children due to substance use, with the goal of keeping kids in their homes and \"ultimately reducing the need for foster care placements.\" Implementing this program through the state's TANF system would \"reduce start-up costs and implementation time,\" she wrote in a statement.",
      "But TANF is available to many families living in poverty and it was unclear how these dollars would be targeted to such a subset.",
      "Similar budget conflicts have surfaced in Connecticut \u2014 whose Democratic governor, the CT Mirror reports, is asking lawmakers to redirect opioid settlement money to social services that were previously funded through other means, including federal dollars \u2014 and Arizona, whose legislature transferred $115 million in settlement money to the state prison system last year to help close a $1.4 billion budget deficit.",
      "National recovery advocate Ryan Hampton expects to see more efforts like this nationwide.",
      "\"I have a very high level of fear that states are going to be tapping into these settlement dollars in every creative way they can to fill some of these budget shortfalls,\" he said. \"It's a grave misuse of funds and one that is going to have dire consequences.\"",
      "Although national overdose deaths have declined recently, tens of thousands of Americans are still dying from overdoses each year. In a few states, including Nevada, such deaths increased in the 12 months leading up to September.",
      "\"The intent of these dollars is to save lives right now,\" said Hampton, who is in recovery from opioid addiction and founded a Nevada-based recovery advocacy organization. He submitted a public comment opposing the Nevada governor's budget proposal.",
      "Hampton and other advocates worry that using opioid funds for services that, even if crucial, are only tangentially related to addiction risks a repeat of the tobacco settlement of the 1990s.",
      "At that time, cigarette manufacturers agreed to pay state governments billions of dollars annually. Initially, states spent a chunk of that money on anti-smoking programs, said Meg Riordan, a vice president of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which tracks states' spending on tobacco prevention programs.",
      "But over time, states encountered budget crunches and many raided or dissolved trust funds they'd set up to protect tobacco money. Instead, they funneled the cash directly into their general funds and spent it on infrastructure projects and budget shortfalls.",
      "\"Once the funds start going somewhere else, there's a risk that they won't come back,\" Riordan said.",
      "Tobacco use remains a leading cause of preventable death in America.",
      "The opioid settlements have more guardrails than the tobacco settlement did, but KFF Health News' multiyear investigation found lax oversight and enforcement.",
      "Nevada and Connecticut are among 13 states that have explicitly restricted the practice of supplantation, or using opioid settlement funds to replace existing funding streams.",
      "Whitley, Nevada's DHHS director, and the governor's office have insisted that none of their proposed uses of settlement funds are examples of supplanting.",
      "At the February hearing, Whitley repeatedly suggested that the budget proposal was misworded, creating a false impression. \"We'll clean that up with the language,\" he said.",
      "But he also emphasized the importance of settlement dollars as federal funding sources diminish. \"As ARPA [the American Rescue Plan Act] goes away and other flexible funding goes away to address problems, this becomes one that really we have to rely on,\" he said.",
      "That perspective seems reasonable to JK Costello, director of behavioral health consulting for the Steadman Group, a company that he said is helping about a dozen local governments across the country administer the settlements.",
      "Ideally settlement money adds to existing services, he said, but realistically, some safety net programs, even if they don't directly address addiction, can be a lifeline for people with opioid use disorder. If major cuts in federal spending imperil those programs, using settlement funds to save them could be worthwhile.",
      "\"Getting people into great treatment when their housing voucher is cut isn't really that helpful,\" Costello said. \"Treatment isn't going to work if they're not able to eat or feed their kids.\"",
      "The tricky thing is that many community organizations that work directly on addiction and recovery issues are also feeling the crunch of expiring federal aid and expected federal program changes that would reduce their resources, Costello said. When everyone is strapped, deciding where limited settlement dollars can do the most good becomes increasingly challenging.",
      "Some places presciently set aside opioid settlement funds in \"emergency\" or \"sustainability\" accounts that could be tapped for addiction services in case of declining federal aid. South Dakota has such a fund with more than $836,000, according to its 2024 opioid report. None of it has been used yet.",
      "Kristen Pendergrass, vice president of state policy for the addiction-focused nonprofit Shatterproof, hopes states turn to rainy day funds first, before raiding settlement accounts.",
      "Nevada has $1.23 billion in its rainy day fund, more than the national median, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts.",
      "\"It would be a slippery slope if we stop paying attention now\" and allow settlement funds to be used for anything, Pendergrass said. \"The money was won to remediate harms and save lives. It should be used that way.\"",

    "story": [
      "All U.S. Agency for International Development direct hires deemed non-essential will be placed on administrative leave at 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday, according to an email sent from the Office of the Administrator and reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Those being placed on leave \u2014 an estimated 4,200 staffers \u2014 would be notified by 5 p.m. Sunday, the email said. USAID is also resuming \"voluntary Agency-funded return travel\" for impacted employees overseas, according to the email.",
      "USAID employs more than 10,000 people, according to the Congressional Research Service, with around 4,800 direct hires stationed in foreign and domestic posts.",
      "Per the email, approximately 2,000 personnel in duty stations across the U.S. will also be subject to a reduction in force.",
      "USAID had previously deemed 611 workers as essential amid an initial attempt earlier this month to place the majority of direct hires on leave. But a judge, in response to a lawsuit brought by two unions representing USAID employees, had ordered the agency to temporarily reinstate some 2,100 personnel who had previously been placed on leave while blocking the administration from placing another 2,000 or so on leave. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was appointed by President Trump, also put a stay on orders for overseas personnel to return home.",
      "However, Nichols on Friday chose not to extend the temporary stay.",
      "In a\u00a026-page decision, Nichols said the potential harm asserted by the unions did not warrant emergency relief.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have presented no irreparable harm they or their members are imminently likely to suffer from the hypothetical future dissolution of USAID,\" Nichols wrote, adding that those placed on leave still have the ability to go through the standard process of bringing their concerns before the government body for employee complaints.",
      "While the lift on the stay allows the Trump administration to place USAID workers on leave, a ruling in a separate lawsuit brought by a group of nonprofit organizations and contractors that received funding for foreign aid projects is still preventing the administration from pausing foreign aid, grants and contracts previously appropriated by Congress while legal proceedings continue.",
      "USAID is also establishing a \"Coordination Support Team\" made up of several working groups to \"reduce uncertainty for our employees and to find solutions to logistical issues facing personnel and programs,\" according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The working groups, co-lead by USAID Acting Chief of Staff Joel Borkert and Marcus Thornton, a member of the Secretary of State's policy planning staff, are focused on facilitating safe returns for USAID personnel overseas and their families, maintaining operations for life-saving humanitarian assistance and other programs that have received waivers, and \"addressing logistical challenges,\" the email said.",
      "Established in 1961, USAID was one of the first agencies Mr. Trump and Elon Musk \u2014  who is classified as a special government employee, but who the White House has claimed in a court filing has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions\" and is not an employee of the\u00a0White House's Department Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 in their efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.",
      "According to three U.S. officials, Mr. Trump plans to merge USAID into the State Department and severely reduce its staff and budget.",

Just a day earlier, the Trump staff shakeup hit the Pentagon with the ouster of the nation's highest-ranking military officer, General C.Q.

      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: Well, Margaret, you, first of all, have to look at what's going on at the moment right? What's the immediate impact?",
      "This position as the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff is in charge, as it sounds, of everybody and planning forward. We have the crisis in the Middle East that's still unfolding. We have got the crisis at the border where more and more active-duty troops are being sent to. Guantanamo is getting built up.",
      "And then you have got Ukraine and the future of NATO. So this comes at a critical time. And the dismissal of C.Q. Brown will have immediate ramifications. In terms of how long it's going to take to replace that, well, there will be a sort of Senate hearing. A person has already been put forward, as we're about to speak about.",
      "But, in addition to that, the other top head to come out of that was Admiral Lisa Franchetti. She's CNO, chief naval officer, in charge of the Navy. That's a big one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The highest-ranking woman.",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: The highest-ranking woman, and unprecedented in that role. And she was the first to become a fleet commander. There are many firsts in Admiral Franchetti's career. And we have profiled her when she became fleet commander.",
      "Very highly thought of among her \u2013 among personnel at the DOD, including young women who aspire to those sort of levels. C.Q. Brown, again, very highly regarded. They \u2013 there was no reason given for the dismissal of these two individuals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: We do know that Secretary Hegseth has actually name- checked C.Q. Brown, saying that he's criticizing him for his DEI programs and saying that\u2026",

      "He also took aim at Admiral Franchetti, suggesting she is a DEI hire herself, by virtue of the fact that she is a woman. Also, in addition to that, there's a \u2013 the state in command of the Air Force who was also removed, so a lot of changes.",
      "And you mentioned the word purge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: And that's exactly what it is at the \u2013 from the very top.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, who is this nominee, or I guess, of \u2013 in the process of becoming the nominee, to step into the role?",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: It's a good question. And there are a lot of people inside the DOD who are asking who this nominee is, retired Lieutenant General Dan Caine.",
      "He just retired recently as a three-star rank. That's kind of important, because this is the first time, at least in my knowledge \u2013 it might be corrected \u2013 the first time a three-star general was promoted to that position and kind of\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and not the head of a combatant command.",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: Exactly, not the head of a combatant command, like CENTCOM or EUCOM, not in charge of one of the armed services branches.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big promotion.",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: Well, yes, some might call it a leapfrog.",
      "If he is to be accepted into this role, he will automatically be given that fourth star. But, more importantly, there are certain rules and regulations, that he would have been the first, because he didn't have that combatant command and because he wasn't in charge of one of the armed forces.",
      "But from \u2013 we have been asking around. And I know people who know him personally. They say, look, he's a stand-up guy, nicest man you want to meet. There had been some questions about whether or not he was sort of political. I know that President Trump had said that he had met the guy and said that he loves him, as in he loves Trump.",
      "According to my sources, that conversation didn't take place. He doesn't own a MAGA cap. He didn't put one on. So he's been described as apolitical. And he's somebody who may not have the experience, but has the character to lead the force.",
      "But I think what we have to look at here, right\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHARLIE D'AGATA: \u2026 we have got Defense Secretary Hegseth, and then we have this individual, two relatively inexperienced people at the very highest level of the DOD.",

      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL (D-New York): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were just here in Washington, and you met privately with President Trump. In the past, you've said the relationship doesn't have to be adversarial. Was your meeting with him adversarial? And what was your top message?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: It wasn't an adversarial meeting, but I was very clear, especially after I found that the Trump administration had ended a program that was put in place, congestion pricing, by the duly elected members of our legislature, representing the voice of the people, and with a tweet, he claims that he is the king, and, therefore, he has the power to destroy it.",
      "And I have a problem with that characterization, because we labored under a king 250 years ago, and, as I said, we're not going back there. So I wanted to take my case to him directly and let him see the benefits of this program, because our city is paralyzed with gridlock. And we had a path forward to be able to make the city move again, and it's working.",
      "I wanted to just have that opportunity to convey that. But I don't know that we're very persuasive on that front, but that's OK. The people in my state need to know I'm willing to take the fight wherever I have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, just to explain for our audience, congestion pricing, you're talking about this $9 toll you put on people driving into Lower Manhattan below 60th Street.",
      "Your fellow Democrat Phil Murphy of New Jersey says he doesn't like this policy, actually asked President Trump to stop it. President Trump's office says this is discriminatory against working-class people. How do you respond to that?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: I respond this way. With all due respect to the state of New Jersey, they do not tell us in New York what to do, nor does Washington, when it comes to policies that we believe are going to reduce congestion, move along vehicles. Emergency vehicles are moving faster. Air quality is improving.",
      "So I have arguments that are important, but no one else should be able to second-guess us, because that's not how our system of laws and states was set up. I'm the governor of New York. I will deal with the internal issues before me without interference from New Jersey or, indeed, the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is going to the courts?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Oh, yes, it's going to the courts, and I believe we will be victorious in the courts, and this program will continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, this is not the only standoff between the state and federal government and the tension here.",
      "I know you were in Washington with other governors who were meeting with the president this week. Federal funds account for about 40 percent of your state's budget. President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds to governors in order to force compliance with his agenda.",
      "Here's what he said to the governor of Maine. Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Is Maine here, the Governor of Maine?",
      "GOVERNOR JANET MILLS (D-Maine): Yes, I'm here.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Are you not going to comply with it?",
      "GOVERNOR JANET MILLS: I will comply with state and federal laws.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm \u2013 we are the federal law. Well, you better do it. You better do it, because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was about transgender athletes on girls sports teams.",
      "Are you Democratic governors going to start to work together on this? Is there legal pushback?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: What he is doing is \u2013 they've described it as flooding the zone.",
      "They're attacking California when it comes to FEMA dollars. They're filing lawsuits in Illinois. They're going after Maine on this, and they're coming after programs that have been duly put in place in the state of New York.",
      "What they're trying to do is create this theater of all kinds of activity that is trying to be a distraction to us. And when someone floods the zone in a football game, what you need to have is the defenders be very disciplined, smart, but also stand their ground. And that's exactly what New York governors, the governor of New York will do, in cooperation with our governors.",
      "We're not going to sit idly by and let our rights be attacked. We'll work with you when there's common ground, no doubt about it. Let's build great projects and infrastructure. There's areas where we're going to work with you on immigration and getting the violent criminals off our streets. We do not dispute that. But don't think that you can just come in and bully us around and not expect a reaction from governors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that, when it comes to your state, there's been a lot of focus on Manhattan and the Department of Justice because of Eric Adams and the ongoing legal issues he has.",
      "In the past week, four deputy mayors resigned. Seven federal prosecutors resigned after the Trump Justice Department moved to dismiss those five counts of federal corruption indictments against \u2013 against Mayor Adams.",
      "You know the allegation is that the dismissal of the charges was in \u2013 related to a quid pro quo around immigration compliance. Did you discuss this case at all with the president when you were in the room with him one on one?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: No, I did not. In fact, it's \u2013 we're waiting for the decision by a judge on whether he's going to accept those \u2013 the recommendation for a dismissal. So that's still in litigation.",
      "But I will say this. We are not allowing the Trump administration to interfere in the operations of our city. And the legal problems that the mayor is facing because of the Trump administration, and the phrasing they have used, and, indeed, an interview that was done by one of his representatives on national television, saying that he's basically got the mayor under his control, that's concerning.",
      "And I have to be able to put in safeguards. Of course, everyone says I had the option to remove him. I still hold that option to remove him. It is an extraordinary power. And I know there's a lot of people disappointed and angry and want something done immediately, but I will always stand on the fact that we are a nation of laws.",
      "And one individual, the governor of New York, should not use her voice and her will to override the will of the voters. We have an election in a few months for \u2013 in a primary. I'm going to let the voters decide, but I'm also going to be very cognizant. I need to keep an eye on this situation, especially the way the Trump administration has telegraphed that they want to get into our operations, and I have to be the firewall to stop that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, having said that, does that mean you do believe there was a quid pro quo understanding with Eric Adams?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: I am going by what the perception could be. I cannot let the integrity of the administration in the city of New York be undermined by perception that the Trump administration actually created. They created this perception.",
      "The reality, I will never know. But as long as there's the faith of New Yorkers that has been undermined by what the Trump administration doing is trying to give the appearance of holding the city hostage, those are \u2013 but that's exactly what they're trying to do.",
      "Again, they're trying to create chaos. But we have to be smart as Democrats and as leaders and parse through all this and just go do what's right. That will always be my North Star.",

      "STEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you.",
      "I want to start on the Mideast first. You have said you are headed there this week to work on a hostage deal. I know Prime Minister Netanyahu has changed his negotiating team. Will we get to phase two of this hostage deal? And can we get that American citizen Edan Alexander out any time soon?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: So, I \u2013 we \u2013 we will get to stage two \u2013 or phase two. And I'm very focused on that, and I think it's going to happen.",
      "I'm going there probably Wednesday evening. I will spend five days there as soon as I arrive, making \u2013 going to various countries, including Qatar, Egypt, Israel, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.",
      "And, as to Edan Alexander, he's front and center for us. I know his parents. We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home. And we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in that second phase, talking about what comes next for Gaza becomes part of that. For that day after, do Hamas leaders need to leave Gaza? Are you discussing that? And, if so, where would they go?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: So, Margaret, the \u2013 the May 27 protocol agreement signed last May 27 sets forth that the phase two negotiation is much about two things, A, a permanent cease-fire, a cessation of all violence, and, in addition to that, the fact that Hamas cannot be allowed to come back into the government.",
      "And I think the way you square that circle is that Hamas has to go. They've got to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Physically?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And we're going to \u2013 the negotiation will be around that.",
      "I would say physically. That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where would they go? Has any country offered to take them in?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I think \u2013 I think the devil is in the details, and we've had a lot of discussions around it. I'm not at liberty to have that discussion, that specific discussion today, but we've got some ideas, and that will be part of the negotiation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been quoted as saying that when you went to Gaza and you personally saw the devastation there, you couldn't understand why anyone would say \u2013 stay, but it doesn't mean you can't have some sort of right to return, if that's the policy that works for people.",
      "Does the Trump administration support Palestinians' right to return?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, Margaret, first of all, what I would say is this.",
      "President Trump is one of the most sensible human beings you're ever going to meet. He is \u2013 he understands that it makes no sense to endorse old policy prescriptions that have not worked. And what has not worked in Gaza are all of these old policy prescriptions.",
      "So, he's come up with a new notion. And the new notion is, let's create a better opportunity for these \u2013 for people who have lived in Gaza to have a better life for themselves, better upside, better aspirations for what can happen for their children and so forth.",
      "The May 27 protocol talked about Gaza as if it was a five-year reconstruction plan. We've been talking in the Trump administration about a 15-year horizon, perhaps even 20 years. And now, all of a sudden, The Wall Street Journal printed an article yesterday agreeing with that math.",
      "There is a much \u2013 level-setting the facts suggest that nobody can really live there in a safe environment for probably at least 15 years. So, effectively, we need \u2013 effectively, people have been under this misassumption. When you're under a misassumption about facts, you're not going to make decisions correctly.",
      "We're making decisions based on a real set of facts. And so there's a lot of work that has to be done there. There's tons of demolition. There's artillery shells all over the place that could explode at any moment. This is a much longer project, and people don't belong living there right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they could return?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: That's \u2013 that's \u2013 again, goes to the devil in the details.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I'm not sure that anyone has a problem with people \u2013 with people returning. We've had these discussions around that.",
      "I just think the fundamental issue today is how we get phase two done and then develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And for that, you've got to have a real set of facts. And we've been operating prior to the Trump administration coming in under facts that are just not accurate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about Russia.",
      "You are a very trusted adviser to President Trump, and he sent you to speak face to face with Vladimir Putin. FOX reported you sat with Putin for 3.5 hours. You said that you spent a lot of time talking, developing a friendship and a relationship with Putin, and that's how you helped bring this U.S. citizen Marc Fogel home.",
      "Can you take us inside that room? Did you have a translator? Did you have a notetaker? Were you talking in English? What happened?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: There was a translator. And, in fact, there were two translators.",
      "And I \u2013 to me, the assignment was trust-building and speaking behalf \u2013 on behalf of my boss, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. And I had no expectation as to how long the meeting was going to last. I was intent on carrying a message from the president to President Putin.",
      "I had been advised that the president \u2013 that President Putin had something for me to transmit back to the president. And the meeting ended, I looked at my watch, and it was close to 3.5 hours that we were in there. And, hopefully, that that suggests that a lot of good things got accomplished.",
      "I think that President Trump believes \u2013 and I believe because he believes it \u2013 that trust-building begins with good, proper communication. And we had really good \u2013 we just had a great discussion, me and President Putin. And now it will be up to President Putin and President Trump to work something out. And I think they're going to be successful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you have an intelligence officer or anyone else with you? That's an extraordinary amount of face time with Putin.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I had \u2013 it was just me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was just you.",
      "The head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund \u2013 I know you know him \u2013 Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters that\u2026",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 afterward, they expect a number of American companies to return to Russia this year.",
      "Is he right to expect that? Did you discuss lifting U.S. sanctions off of Russia?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: We \u2013 we did not have that specific discussion at \u2013 at the meeting you're referring to.",
      "But I think that \u2013 that, obviously, there would be an expectation that, if we get to a peace deal, that you would be able to have American companies come back and do business there. And I think that everybody would believe that that would be a positive, good thing to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: After the end to the war and concessions were made by Russia?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, that's what everybody wants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And what everybody wants, the \u2013 the beginning of that, Margaret, is \u2013 is \u2013 would be a \u2013 would be a temporary cease-fire.",
      "But \u2013 but the long-term goal would be an end to this. The \u2013 we've had a - - you know, close to a million-and-a-half deaths. And so, you know, President Trump, the \u2013 his \u2013 his agenda is to end this carnage. It just didn't belong to happen \u2013 it didn't need to happen.",
      "And it doesn't need to continue, not, you know, another day. So we're on it, at his direction. And I think there is \u2013 you're going to see some \u2013 some real positive developments in the near-term future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, thank you for joining us.",
      "We'll be back in a moment with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay tuned for our next half-hour, including an interview with Utah Republican Senator John Curtis.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Utah Republican Senator John Curtis.",
      "Good to see you here in person, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS (R-UT): It's nice to be in person. Good morning. And lots to talk about today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely.",
      "I want to get your perspective on the decision by the president on Friday to dismiss not only the chair of the Joint Chiefs but also five other senior military officers. The former chair of the Joint Chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, released a statement saying, \"trust should be based on leadership, integrity and performance. To relieve a senior officer not for a lack of one of those qualities but for a real or perceived disagreement in their beliefs harmfully politicizes the military profession.\"",
      "Are you concerned that's what's happening here?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: You know, I think we have to stop and look what happened really last November. And one of my colleagues describe it this way, it was a stop the car moment. Those of us who have had young kids and been on family vacations know what a stop the car moment is. It's, kids, you're so disruptive, we're stopping the car.",
      "And I think in many ways the American people said, stop the car. We want dramatic change. We're unhappy with what's happening at the border, we're unhappy with the economy, we're unhappy with so many things. You keep promising that you're going to cut spending, and you don't. Stop the car. And so people really shouldn't be surprised that this is a stop the car moment. We don't get to go to Disneyland until we figure this out. And I think that's what people are seeing right now in Washington.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think part of the public frustration, or that there was correct to be frustration, with the leadership at the Pentagon or the president's top military adviser?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Look, we elected a commander in chief last November. This is his discretion. They want change. The people want change.",
      "We all knew what we were getting with President Trump, right? Nobody should be really surprised at the - at these dramatic shocks to the system. The system needs a shock. And I think you're - what you're seeing as a result of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern, though, at a time of geopolitical risk, as our Pentagon correspondent was suggesting there, that, you know, carrying the institutional knowledge with you through a transition, we're still at the beginning of the Trump administration, certainly, that there could be a hiccup there or some complication.",
      "I mean, General Caine is - or Lieutenant General Caine is a - is a three star. He's retired. It's not clear if he needs a congressional waiver or not to take this job because he didn't run a combatant command.",
      "Do you know how complicated it will be to get him in place, or how long?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: So, listen, yes, it - I don't. And I'm not overly worried about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: I'll come back to this, the American people have asked for change. They've lost - lost confidence in so many things. They want to see dramatic change. That - that was a stop the car moment. And what happened at the Pentagon was a stop the car moment. Let's make some change.",
      "We've tried subtle changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: We've tried the easy changes. We've tried working around the edges. And I think the American people are saying, it didn't work. Let's - let's do something more dramatic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we've certainly seen dramatic. You had the video at the Conservative Political Action Committee of Elon Musk wielding this shiny chainsaw.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's celebrating this Department of Government Efficiency idea.",
      "Yesterday, federal employees also received an e-mail, I'm sure you've heard, telling them to reply by midnight Monday to a message with five bullet points of what they accomplished in the last week. Elon Musk tweeted, failure to do so would result in firing.",
      "Utah has 33,000 federal employees. Is that how they should be treated?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: So, listen, let's go back to $36 thousand - trillion of debt. And we have to do something dramatic.",
      "Now, to answer your question, I don't believe so. You know I just published an op-ed to DeseretNews.com - deseret.com, and I talk about my experience as mayor and having to do similar things. If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's, like, please put a dose of compassion in - in this. These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. We - it's a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel to do it as well. We can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's not just about efficiency, though. I mean the president himself has characterized this as getting rid of bad people.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: You know, I regret that narrative. We all know, you know, thousands, millions of federal workers who are good people, who work hard. But the reality of it is, we have 3 million federal workers. Not all of them do. Many aren't coming to work. In my work - business -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Working from home, you mean?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Working from home. Let's hope they're working from home. We don't know. That's why the e-mail. What are you doing? It's not unusual, in a corporate setting, to have people report and explain what they're doing, especially if they're working from home. So, I don't think this is a request that is that difficult. I would ask my employees to let me know what they're doing. But I will double down on the fact of, we don't need to be so cold and hard and let's put a little compassion and, quite frankly, dignity in this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And in that op-ed you said, \"sometimes it is the worst day of someone's life to receive a notice like this.\"",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: It is. Yes, going back to my experience as mayor, we did have to let some people go. We did a lot through attrition. But every single person we let go, I met with personally. I looked them in the eye. I told them why we had to do it. How can we then help you transition to the next thing. We can do both things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's not happening at all right now, as you know. At these department agencies - some of them, they're just getting locked out of systems. People don't even know who to ask. They can't ask HR. And HR says, I don't know, if they can't get ahold of them at all.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Yes. But - but also - I'll also come back to this, stop the car moment. Like, this is not a normal moment. We have tried. We've tried for years to do this gracefully. We've tried for years to do this slowly. And we have failed consistently. And the American people said, enough. We're tired of this. You have to make these changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you believe the president has the unilateral authority to cancel funds appropriated by Congress?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Well, what we're seeing play out is the wrestle between the three branches of government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: We'll find out. And this is the beauty of the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have a point of view?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Well, listen, I - I believe in the Constitution, right? I believe this is how we test the Constitution. And people have said, oh, this is a constitutional crisis. And I say exactly the opposite, it's proving to work. We have the court's playing in it. We have Congress who will play in it. We have the ability - I think we hold a lot of responsibility for what's happening right now. We could solve the budget as Congress, we could solve the border, and we haven't. And both parties, when Congress doesn't do their job, and the White House, have a tendency to try to solve it.",
      "Let's let this play out by the Constitution and - and then, Congress, let's step up, right? We need to do - I'll be the first to say, we - this is a problem that Congress is, in many cases, has given the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pushback has been relatively quiet. You're gently doing that by saying, be more compassionate.",
      "Senator Murkowski was telling constituents the other day, I can't be the only one speaking out.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: So, listen -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are Republican lawmakers going to be more forceful?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Well, listen, I don't know what you want me to be more forceful on. Stop the car. Like, fix this. That's what Utahans are telling me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, in terms of the congressional role here, the check that Congress is supposed to put on the executive.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Yes. But I also think that's a stop the car moment. Congress has failed in these - in these things. And the - and the people have said, fix it. So, Donald Trump is trying to fix it with the tools that he has.",
      "The courts will push back if he steps out of line. We've seen that. We know that. We saw that with President Biden as well. And that's the beauty of the system. I works.",
      "Now, it's very - it's - the - the people back home are impatient. If you were to walk on the streets of Utah, they would say, stop the car, John. Like, we - this is not good. You have promised, your colleagues have promised, for decades that you would fix these things, and you haven't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if the fiscal problems are fixed in the near term.",
      "Senator, it's going to be up to you and your fellow lawmakers.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "I want to refer back to the interview we just did with the president's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. You watched the Middle East closely. I know you were just meeting with Arab leaders when you were in - in Europe last week.",
      "He said that it is not realistic to have Palestinians remain in Gaza while it is rebuilt. Egypt and Jordan are working on plans for that to be possible. Does - does that proposal have any chance of surviving, or is this idea of moving them away for 15 years going to happen?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): So, the good news in what Steve Witkoff said was that he expected us to get to phase two of the discussions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: The very bad news was, he did not disavow this outrageous idea that Donald Trump put on the table of cleaning out 2 million Gazans. That is ethnic cleansing by another name. And Arab countries are right now working very hard to put together a plan to show that you can deal with the governance, security and reconstruction, and that you don't need to, you know, have 2 million people pushed out of Gaza in order to do it.",
      "It is tough. It will have to be done in stages. And they have identified areas in Gaza, few areas in Gaza, that have not been obliterated where you can begin to phase the reconstruction and at least get people housing, temporary housing, as you rebuild in other areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But how does that survive if the United States' most powerful player is saying, that's not what we want to do?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, this is a big problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because when Trump made those statements, what he did was fueled even more the far, far right in Israel. The Ben-Gvir, the Smotriches who are just celebrating because their idea all along has been to move 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza. They also want to move Palestinians out of the West Bank into places like Jordan and Egypt.",
      "So, in addition to being a reprehensible idea for moral and legal reasons, it would also totally destabilize the region, which is why the Arab countries are working so furiously to put together a plan that addresses these issues and has a future horizon that provides security to both Israelis and Palestinians and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are also hearing that the president is closing in on this deal with Ukraine in regard to its mineral resources that can be used for all sorts of valuable technology. What security guarantees are you comfortable with the U.S. giving to Ukraine as part of any of this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I think this is all negotiable. But what you should not do, Margaret, is begin your negotiation with Putin by, number one, adopting the Putin narrative, saying that Ukraine started this war, which is just a big lie. And you shouldn't begin by giving up certain key cards.",
      "So, for example, American guarantees or a future for Ukraine in NATO. However you settle this in the end is a matter of negotiation. But it's terrible negotiating to give up those cards up front, as - as Trump has done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was extraordinary to hear Steve Witkoff describe his meeting with Vladimir Putin, as he did for us.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I would just say that this is not America first. This is America in retreat. And China and Russia and our adversaries are celebrating every moment of this as our allies are scared to death. And this is not just rhetoric. This is reality. And so -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is what you heard at Munich last week?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, well, and I think, you know, European allies and others from around the world who believe in freedom and democracy, they're wondering whether this is just rhetoric or whether this is a real shift.",
      "My warning to them is, I think this is reality. I think Trump is much closer ideologically to Putin and other autocrats around the world than he is to democratic countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An extraordinary statement to digest.",
      "But I want to ask you about what - what's happening here at home, because you sit on some powerful committees. The administration did have some legal wins this past week. USAID, a federal judge said that they can put on administrative leave thousands of USAID employees. Another district court denied a request from unions to stop the firing of federal employees. Are Democrats too knee-jerk to say that all this is unlawful?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No, this is unlawful. In many of these cases, judges found that the plaintiffs did not have standing, but other parts of their opinion clearly indicated that Elon Musk did not have the authority to do what he's doing.",
      "So, we just talked about the great betrayal of the Ukrainian people. What we're witnessing now is the great betrayal of the American people.",
      "Canada - Trump said he was going to lower prices. Right now what he's doing is slashing important public services that help every American in order to finance a tax cut for the super rich, for Elon Musk and the billionaires.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there was this e-mail that went out yesterday to federal employees. We know that at the FBI and the State Department management inside those agencies has - have told employees, don't respond to the personnel e-mail saying respond with your five bullet points.",
      "Can people working at the State Department feel safe not responding? Are they putting their jobs at risk?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I don't think so because what we are witnessing are illegal actions by Elon Musk. And a number of courts, as you know, have issued temporary restraining orders on their efforts to seize important private information, but also on their overall conduct. So, what the head of management at the State Department said is, Elon Musk doesn't have the authority to require State Department employees to answer these questions. That has to happen in the chain of command.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though the president says he wants him to be more aggressive?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, the reality is, we don't - we don't know what the president meant. But as you pointed out, you've got Elon Musk taking a chainsaw to the federal government and important services. And there's no article four in the Constitution that gives Elon Musk that authority. And the way that he's been sort of, quote, delegating his authority is - there - is illegal. And the actions he's taking are illegal and we need to shut down this illegal operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your insight today.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's a former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member.",
      "Welcome back, Dr. Gottlieb.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner and Current Pfizer Board Member): Thanks a lot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen these troubling measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico. Nearly 100 people sickened. It looks like most of those who have been infected were unvaccinated and the outbreak area has one of the highest vaccination exemption rates in the state. How concerned are you, though, that this could spread?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Very concerned. I think this will spread. There's been 100 cases that have been identified so far. There's probably many more than that. So, I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases and could take many months to try to fully snuff out.",
      "And when you have that kind of a concentration of measles within a community, it's going to inevitably spread outside that community. When you look around the country, there's a lot of parts of the country, states that have relatively low vaccination rates when it comes to MMR right now. You look at Idaho, about 80 percent oof children have been vaccinated for MMR. Alaska and Wisconsin at about at 84 percent. Minnesota, 87 percent. States like Florida, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia, Utah, around 88 percent. Iowa, I think, is at 89 percent.",
      "And herd immunity is achieved at a vaccination rate of between 93 and 95 percent. And even within those states, it's not like the low vaccination rates are distributed evenly across the states. There's pockets of under vaccination as communities have relatively low vaccination rates. And so, when you have this much virus spreading in that portion of Texas and New Mexico, I think that there's some inevitability that you're going to see cases exported into other states where there's low vaccination rates. And you could see a continuous spread across the country. Even at a low level we could get some endemic spread.",
      "And the risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread even at a low level. And the U.S. could be at risk of losing its measles elimination status, which would have more profound implications on things like travel advisories that could be initiated from other countries.",
      "And so, beyond just the public health impact of this, which I think is quite substantial, there could be some economic impacts as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, finally, when you look at that outbreak in Texas, 27 percent of people have been hospitalized. And there's been four cases where children have contracted measles that have been vaccinated. So, those were probably kids who only had one dose of the vaccine. But there's a lot of people who are at risk of this beyond just the people who have chosen to forgo the vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's terrifying, Doctor. And kids are usually vaccinated, as any parent knows, around one year old roughly.",
      "The MMR vaccine, though, this is the vaccine against measles, is particularly scrutinized. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now the HHS secretary, has accused it of causing issues in children. He wrote the forward to a book questioning vaccines, saying measles is \"a disease that is rarely life threatening and a vaccine that is largely unnecessary but carries real risks.\"",
      "He is now the HHS secretary. How does he restore confidence in a vaccine that he previously denigrated?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's going to be difficult. And as best I can tell, he hasn't spoken to this outbreak. I think you captured the essence of the argument from Mr. Kennedy, as well as people within his anti-vacs movement, that they believe this vaccine isn't effective. That's not true. It's highly effective. And that measles itself isn't a bad illness. And I think there's been some statements that actually getting measles has certain long-term advantage, which is just patently false. This is a very dangerous virus. And as I said, about 27 percent of the kids who have been infected in that west Texas outbreak and the New Mexico outbreak have been hospitalized. So, this is going to be a quite serious illness with long-term consequences.",
      "Herd immunity is achieved at 93 to 95 percent. We're well below that in most parts of the country. Texas actually has a high vaccination rate and I think Texas local public health officials are doing a good job to try to get control of this outbreak. But now that it's stretched into the hundreds of cases, it's going to be very difficult.",
      "This has been a vaccine that's been studied extensively. The links between - the alleged links between MMR vaccine and autism have been the subject of some of the most - the largest studies ever undertaken. There were two studies done in Denmark, each with about 500,000 children enrolled in those studies. There were also a number of studies that were commissioned by the CDC and the NIH also looking at this in the United States. And so, this is one of the most extensively studied questions, the purported link between MMR and autism.",
      "And I think the reality is sometimes we have to accept no for an answer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That there just is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and those studies were brought up by Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, in the hearing, and Mr. Kennedy would not affirm them. Senator Cassidy still voted for him, though.",
      "But I want to ask you about another issue. Our correspondent, Camilo Montoya-Galvez, has learned the Trump administration is preparing plans to use a health authority, known as Title 42, which you remember was used during the pandemic, to restrict migrant entries across the southern border. Now they want to invoke it on the basis of other diseases like TB. Is that warranted right now? Is TB that much of a problem?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I - I think from a policy standpoint, the administration has done a good job shutting down flows across the border. So, I'm not sure why they're reaching for a public health measure to try to provide an additional provision, an additional tool. They seem to have done a good job with the law enforcement that they're doing at the border.",
      "Just from the objective standpoint of TB and the risk of TB being transported across the border, TB incidents rates are high in the countries where immigrants are coming from, but they're not exceedingly high relative to other countries. So, you look at a country like Mexico. The - the incidents of TB is about 30 cases per 100,000 people. In Venezuela, where there's a lot immigrants coming from, it's about 45 per 100,000. That compares to about 10 per 100,000 in a country like England. But you look at a country like India, the incidents is about 200 per 100,000. In South Africa it's about 500 per 100,000. So, there's a lot of countries around the world where people come in from all the time where the incidents of TB is much higher than what - what it is in the countries where people are coming across the border from.",
      "Now, you can argue that people coming in the country from South Africa or India going through regular check points where they might undergo some screening, but I think just purely from an objective public health standpoint, there's probably parts of the world where we have immigrants coming in -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That provide a larger risk of the transmission of TB than across the border.",

I think that there have been steps taken to try to re-adjudicate some of those initial dismissals, at least within the public health context when you look across HHS, and I'm most familiar with FBA where they're hiring back a number of employees. And I think they could hire back fully half of the employees that were initially dismissed at the FDA. And they've tried to preserve things like review functions and inspectors at FDA.

      "Witkoff traveled to Moscow to bring home\u00a0Marc Fogel, an American who had been serving a 14-year sentence in Russia for traveling with medical marijuana. Russia freed Fogel on Feb. 11. Witkoff told a conference last week that he met with Putin before leaving the country with Fogel.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Witkoff said there were two translators at the meeting with Putin, and he was the only U.S. official present. He said he was \"intent on carrying a message from the president to President Putin\" and that he was told that the Russian leader \"had something for me to transmit back to the president.\"",
      "\"The meeting ended, I looked at my watch and it was close to three and a half hours that we were in there. And hopefully that suggests that a lot of good things got accomplished,\" Witkoff said.",
      "A real estate investor and friend of Mr. Trump's who has taken an outsized role in his foreign policy, Witkoff noted that Mr. Trump believes that \"trust-building begins with good, proper communication.\"",
      "\"We just had a great discussion, me and President Putin, and now it will be up to President Putin and President Trump to work something out, and I think they're going to be successful,\" Witkoff said.",
      "In addition to his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also joined Russian and U.S. representatives at a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, where the officials agreed to begin working toward an end to the war in Ukraine and related economic opportunities, though no Ukrainian officials were present.",
      "Witkoff said the officials did not discuss lifting American sanctions on Russia, but he noted that if a peace deal is reached, \"there would be an expectation\" that American companies could return to the country to do business.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has argued that Ukraine should give something to the U.S. in return for the American aid the country has received, pointing to U.S. interest in Ukraine's rare minerals. And the president has escalated a public feud with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in recent days, calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator.\"\u00a0Preparations are underway for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin, Russia's deputy foreign minister told state media on Saturday.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's a former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member. Welcome back, Dr Gottlieb.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen these troubling measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico, nearly 100 people sickened. It looks like most of those who have been infected were unvaccinated, and the outbreak area has one of the highest vaccination exemption rates in the state. How concerned are you though that this could spread?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Very concerned. I think this will spread. There's been 100 cases that have been identified so far. There's probably many more than that. So I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases, and could take many months to try to fully snuff out. And when you have that kind of a concentration of measles within a community, it's going to inevitably spread outside that community. When you look around the country, there's a lot of parts of the country, states that have relatively low vaccination rates when it comes to MMR, right now,. You look at Idaho, about 80% of children have been vaccinated for MMR. Alaska and Wisconsin are about at 84%, Minnesota 87%, states like Florida, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia, Utah, around 88% Iowa, I think, said 89% and herd immunity is achieved at a vaccination rate of between 93 and 95% and even within those states, it's not like the low vaccination rates are distributed evenly across the states. There's pockets of under vaccination. There's communities that have relatively low vaccination rates and so when you have this much virus spreading in that portion of Texas and New Mexico, I think that there's some inevitable- inevitability that you're going to see cases exported into those other states where there's low vaccination rates, and you could see a continuous spread across the country. Even at a low level, we could get some endemic spread. And the risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread, even at a low level, and the U.S. could be at risk of losing its measles elimination status, which would have more profound implications on things like travel advisories that could be initiated from other countries. And so beyond just the public health impact of this, which I think is quite substantial, there could be some economic impacts as well. And finally, when you look at that outbreak in- in Texas, 27% of people have been hospitalized and there's been four cases where children have contracted measles that have been vaccinated. So those are probably kids who only had one dose of the vaccine. But there's a lot of people who are at risk of this, beyond just the people who have chosen to forego the vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's terrifying, doctor and- and kids are usually vaccinated, as any parent knows, around one year old, roughly. The MMR vaccine, though- this is the vaccine against measles, is particularly scrutinized. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now the HHS Secretary, has accused of causing issues in children. He wrote the forward to a book questioning vaccines, saying 'measles is a disease that is rarely life threatening and a vaccine that is largely unnecessary but carries real risks.' He is now the HHS Secretary, how does he restore confidence in a vaccine that he previously denigrated?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it's going to be difficult. And as best I can tell, he hasn't spoken to this outbreak. I think you captured the essence of the argument from Mr. Kennedy, as well as people within his anti-vax movement, that they believe this vaccine isn't effective. That's not true. It's highly effective, and that measles itself isn't a bad illness. And I think there's been some statements that actually getting measles has certain long term advantages, which is just patently false. This is a very dangerous virus, and as I said, about 27% of the kids who have been infected in that West Texas outbreak and the New Mexico outbreak have been hospitalized. So this could be a quite serious illness with long term consequences. Herd immunity is achieved at 93 to 95%. We're well below that in most parts of the country. Texas actually has a high vaccination rate, and I think Texas local public health officials are doing a good job to try to get control of this outbreak, but now that it's stretched into the hundreds of cases, it's going to be very difficult. This has been a vaccine that's been studied extensively, the links between- the alleged links between MMR vaccine and autism have been the subject of some of the most- the largest studies ever undertaken. There were two studies done in Denmark, each with about 500,000 children enrolled in those studies. There were also a number of studies that were commissioned by the CDC and the NIH also looking at this in the United States. And so this is one of the most extensively studied questions, the purported link between MMR and autism. And I think the reality is, sometimes we have to accept no for an answer, that there just is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah and those studies were brought up by Dr Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, in the hearing, and Mr. Kennedy would not affirm them. Senator Cassidy still voted for him, though, but I want to ask you about another issue. Our correspondent Camilo Montoya-Galvez has learned the Trump administration is preparing plans to use a health authority known as Title 42, which you remember was used during the pandemic to restrict migrant agents- entries across the southern border. Now they want to invoke it on the basis of other diseases like TB. Is that warranted right now? Is TB that much of a problem?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I- I think from a policy standpoint, the administration has done a good job shutting down flows across the border, so I'm not sure why they're reaching for a public health measure to try to provide an additional provision, additional tool. They seem to have done a good job with the law enforcement that they're doing at the border, just from the objective standpoint of TB and the risk of TB being transported across the border. TB incidence rates are high in the countries where immigrants are coming from, but they're not exceedingly high relative to other countries. So you look at a country like Mexico, the incidence of TB is about 30 cases per 100,000 people. In Venezuela, where there's also immigrants coming from, it's about 45 per 100,000. That compares to about 10 per 100,000 in a country like England. But you look at a country like India, the incidence is about 200 per 100,000. In South Africa, it's about 500 per 100,000 so there's a lot of countries around the world where people come in from all the time, where the incidence of TB is much higher than what- what it is in the countries where people are coming across the border from. Now, you can argue that people coming in the country from South Africa or India are going through regular checkpoints where they might undergo some screening, but I think just purely from an objective public health standpoint, there's probably parts of the world where we have immigrants coming in that provide a larger risk of the transmission of TB than across the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you give us some perspective on the thousands of employees who are being dismissed from federal health agencies? Should the public be concerned?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I don't- I don't think they should be concerned.

    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found the tomb of King Thutmose II \u2014 the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "title": "Vaccine targeting pancreatic cancer shows promise in new study",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If such an explosion occurred over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "Aside from the nearly 0% chance the asteroid will miss Earth, the good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare if something were to change.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",

      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",

    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",

      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 09:26:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

    "story": [
      "Remi Bateman was born without her left forearm and hand but she doesn't let it slow her down.",
      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",
      "\"He told me he would pay for Remi's hand in cash,\" said Jami.",
      "And that's where the story takes a turn.",
      "Paying it forward",
      "With Schoonover's gift, Jami realized they still had $24,000 in donations. She asked her daughter what she wanted to do with it.",
      "\"Help more kids,\" Remi enthusiastically replied. \"So people can actually have a life-changing arm like me.\"",
      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

    "summary": "\"There may be a vote tonight, there may not be,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said after a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is aiming to vote Tuesday on a budget proposal that would enact trillions of dollars in spending reductions and tax cuts key to President Trump's agenda. But the timing and outcome remained unclear after Speaker Mike Johnson met with his conference in the morning, with handful of members expressing their opposition.",
      "The House Rules Committee advanced the measure Monday night and Johnson had hoped to bring it to the floor Tuesday. But it did not appear that Johnson had won over every Republican he needs to pass the measure after the House Republican Conference met Tuesday morning. Still, Johnson said the House would move forward.",
      "\"We're planning to take up our budget resolution as early as today,\" Johnson said at a news conference following the GOP meeting.",
      "\"There may be a vote tonight, there may not be,\" he said later.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has been racing to move forward with the budget resolution, a crucial step in the budget reconciliation process that Republicans plan to use to enact Mr. Trump's priorities on border security, energy and taxes. After delays due to House Republican infighting, Senate Republicans moved forward with a competing plan earlier this month. But Johnson won a key victory last week when Mr. Trump endorsed his chamber's budget outline.",
      "Still, whether Johnson and his leadership team can rally House Republicans around the budget plan is an open question. And Johnson acknowledged that the math may not be in his favor just yet.",
      "\"There's always more work to do right up to the end for a big vote like this and this is a big one,\"  Johnson said. \"We're very, very close.\"",
      "With a 218-215 majority, Johnson can afford to lose just one vote if all members are present and voting. He told reporters Monday that he had spoken with one holdout, Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana, and had left a voicemail for another, Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky.",
      "But that evening, Massie posted on X, \"If the Republican budget passes, the deficit gets worse, not better.\" Elon Musk replied, \"That sounds bad.\" Then, Spartz, who has already pledged to oppose the budget bill, answered Massie, writing: \"The situation is much worse than it sounds @RepThomasMassie and @elonmusk - we are going to accumulate $24T of additional debt on top of $36T we already have \u2026 reaching $60 TRILLION!\"",
      "Additionally, Rep. Tim Burchett also told reporters Monday night he's a no \"right now\" on the budget resolution, and indicated spending remains his big concern. After the Republican conference met Tuesday morning, the Tennessee Republican said he was still a no.",
      "House Democrats widely oppose the measure, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote a letter to his caucus on Monday telling them \"it's imperative that we are present with maximum attendance.\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, instructed lawmakers to appear on the Capitol steps Tuesday afternoon to demonstrate their opposition to what he called a \"budget scheme that betrays hardworking American families.\"",
      "The House GOP budget plan includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back in an amendment to the resolution that was made to appease conservatives.",
      "The resolution tasks relevant committees with finding billions of dollars in cuts, some of which could target Medicaid, which has prompted concern among some Republicans, especially in swing districts.",
      "GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, was among the Republicans worried about Medicaid cuts, but she met with Johnson Monday and said he assured her that Medicaid recipients would not removed from the rolls \"unless they are not fulfilling the work requirements, and they're not citizens.\"",
      "House Republican leadership refuted the Medicaid concerns on Tuesday, arguing that the GOP shouldn't believe what they say is a Democratic talking point. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer urged that the budget resolution \"merely unlocks the opportunity for committees to begin drafting legislation,\" calling it a \"blueprint to save America.\" And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that the vote is simply one to begin the reconciliation process.",
      "Still, Johnson wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" Johnson said, when asked whether there could be cuts to the program down the line. \"What we're talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "The developments come after the Senate adopted its budget late last week, while the House was away on recess. Since Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House resolution, Senate Republicans have billed their own budget plan as a backup. The Senate plan would divide the reconciliation process into two bills, with the first aimed at quickly delivering resources for border security and defense, while a later bill would tackle the tax priorities. Senate Republicans also want to make the tax cuts permanent, which the House version does not do.",

    "story": [
      "Denny's is the latest breakfast chain to charge extra for orders containing eggs, an ever-costlier commodity in short supply due to the killing of millions of egg-laying hens as a result of bird flu.",
      "The restaurant said the additional and temporary fee will vary by region and location. The move by the Spartanburg, South Carolina-based brand comes weeks after fellow breakfast chain Waffle House added an egg surcharge. The 70-year-old Denny's brand involves 1,499 restaurants, most of them in the U.S. and run by franchisees, according to its website.",
      "The company\u00a0said it attempts to plan ahead \"to minimize the impact market volatility has on our costs and menu pricing,\" but still has to charge more given the nationwide egg shortage and increased cost of eggs, the company said in a statement.",
      "In adding its 50-cent per egg surcharge earlier this month, Waffle House expressed hope that the spikes in egg prices would be short-lived, but added \"we cannot predict how long this shortage will last.\"",
      "According to a forecast by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of eggs will rise 20% this year.",
      "Bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), was confirmed in a commercial flock in the U.S. three years ago.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip\u200b, an Oklahoma death row inmate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma death row inmate who was joined in his bid to have his conviction thrown out by the state's Republican attorney general.",
      "The high court ruled\u00a05-3 in favor of Glossip and reversed a decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that upheld his conviction and death sentence. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for the court and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the court's consideration of the case.",
      "After first finding that the high court has jurisdiction to review the Oklahoma court's decision, Sotomayor wrote that the prosecution's failure to correct testimony of their key witness during the trial violated Glossip's right to due process, entitling him to a new trial.",
      "\"Turning to the merits, we conclude that the prosecution violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony,\" she wrote.",
      "It will now be up to Oklahoma prosecutors to determine how to proceed.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the majority's finding as to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, but said she would not order the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip's conviction. Instead, she said would have sent the case back for more proceedings.",
      "In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court lacks the power to override the decisions of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which declined to grant Glossip clemency in 2023.",
      "\"The court's decision distorts our jurisdiction, imagines a constitutional violation where none occurred, and abandons basic principles governing the disposition of state-court appeals,\" Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito.",
      "The Glossip case",
      "Glossip was convicted in the 1997 murder of the owner of the Oklahoma City motel where he worked and was sentenced to death more than two decades ago. Since then, he has seen nine execution dates come and go, and eaten his \"last meal\" three times.",
      "Glossip had also been before the Supreme Court once before, in 2015, when he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's method of execution on Eighth Amendment grounds.",
      "In the latest challenge, his bid to toss out his conviction and grant him a new trial was backed by Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, because of errors committed during his earlier trial.",
      "A central issue in the court fight involved the testimony of Glossip's co-defendant, Justin Sneed, who claimed Glossip paid him $10,000 to kill Barry Van Treese, the motel owner.",
      "Sneed admitted to robbing and bludgeoning Van Treese and is serving a sentence of life in prison. Glossip, meanwhile, has said he was not involved in the murder and repeatedly maintained his innocence over his roughly 25 years on death row.",
      "Glossip's first conviction was overturned because of ineffective assistance of counsel. During his second trial, Sneed told prosecutors that he had never seen a psychiatrist, but was given lithium after he was arrested. But in 2022, the state found prosecutors' handwritten notes in a banker's box, which Drummond said called into question Sneed's credibility as a witness.",
      "Lawyers for Glossip and Drummond argued the notes showed that Sneed told prosecutors he was given lithium after seeing a jailhouse psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But neither his diagnosis nor his treatment by the psychiatrist were disclosed to Glossip's defense team, which Drummond said indicated prosecutors elicited false testimony on the matter.",
      "Following the revelations, Oklahoma's attorney general disclosed the box's materials to Glossip and had an independent counsel review the case. That examination, conducted by former district attorney Rex Duncan, ended in April 2023 and concluded that Glossip was deprived of a fair trial.",
      "The state asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to toss out Glossip's conviction and sentence, arguing that the errors committed during the trial rendered both flaws. But the court denied relief and ordered the state to move forward with executing Glossip. A request for clemency to the Oklahoma Parole and Pardon Board, which Drummond supported, was also unsuccessful after it deadlocked 2-2.",
      "Glossip and Drummond then urged the Supreme Court to step in. The court in May 2023 agreed to pause his execution and months later agreed to hear his case. Gorsuch did not participate in the proceedings, likely because of earlier involvement when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Oklahoma.",
      "Arguments in the case took place in early October at the start of the Supreme Court's new term. Many of the questions focused on the interpretation of prosecutors' notes, as well as how the jury's view of the case would have been impacted had they known Sneed was prescribed lithium by a psychiatrist after his arrest.",
      "Writing for the majority, Sotomayor said the jury's assessment of Sneed's credibility was determinative.",
      "\"Had the prosecution corrected Sneed on the stand, his credibility plainly would have suffered,\" she wrote. \"That correction would have revealed to the jury not just that Sneed was untrustworthy ... but also that Sneed was willing to lie to them under oath. Such a revelation would be significant in any case, and was especially so here where Sneed was already 'nobody's idea of a strong witness.'\"",
      "The court found that even though Sneed's bipolar disorder was irrelevant, \"his willingness to lie about it to the jury was not.\"",
      "But writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of \"having bent the law at every turn to grant relief\" to Glossip, and said the court had no authority to order a new trial.",
      "As to Sneed's credibility, Thomas wrote that \"there is no reason to think\" that disclosing his bipolar disorder would have affected the outcome of the trial.",
      "\"The court stretches the law at every turn to rule in [Glossip's] favor,\" Thomas wrote. \"At the threshold, it concocts federal jurisdiction by misreading the decision below. On the merits, it finds a due process violation based on patently immaterial testimony about a witness's medical condition. And, for the remedy, it orders a new trial in violation of black-letter law on this Court's power to review state-court judgments.\"",

    "summary": "Lab tests suggest a strain of the flu virus circulating this season may not be \"well-recognized\" by the flu vaccine.",
    "story": [
      "This season's influenza vaccine may have been a poor match to a strain of the flu virus that caused many infections this winter, early data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests.",
      "The CDC's latest data come as much of the U.S. is finally seeing signs of a slowdown in influenza activity after waves of illness this past fall and winter that climbed to the worst rates recorded from hospitals and doctor's offices since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.",
      "\"This is a bad year, no doubt about it,\" Dr. Jon LaPook, CBS News chief medical correspondent, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday.",
      "Up to 910,000 hospitalizations are estimated to have been caused by the flu since October 2024, which puts the season on track to be the most severe in at least a decade.",
      "\"Depending on the strain, depending on what's going on, it could really vary. And this year is brutal,\" said LaPook.",
      "Every season, the CDC's scientists test a sample of flu viruses collected from labs around the country against strains that health authorities had picked out for use in the latest update to the annual flu vaccine.",
      "\"CDC antigenically characterizes about 2,000\u202fflu viruses during a typical flu season to monitor for changes in circulating viruses and to compare how similar these viruses are to those included in flu vaccines,\" Paul Prince, a CDC spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "Many of the flu viruses that the CDC has tested this season were \"well-recognized\" by antibodies targeted to the vaccine, which helps the body fight off the infection, the agency reported this month. The testing is done using antibodies from ferrets, which have similar influenza symptoms to humans.",
      "But against the H3N2 strain of influenza, which this season has made up just over half of the influenza A viruses scrutinized by the agency, only around 50.9% of the samples were \"well-recognized\" by the antibodies.",
      "That's far below this time last year, when the CDC reported that all H3N2 viruses they tested were \"well-recognized\" by the vaccine virus antibodies.",
      "Experts cautioned that many other factors can play a role in changing how effectively vaccines hold up against influenza in the real world. For example, unlike the laboratory ferrets, people's immune systems build up defenses to parts of the virus encountered in previous years.",
      "\"Humans mostly have pre-existing immunity, which can result in different immune responses. These can be broader or narrower or different,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the University of Georgia's Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research, in an email.",
      "Tompkins said that it was possible for the vaccines to offer good protection, even in situations where the shots were not a good match.",
      "\"Humans, once you get infected and reinfected, your system typically starts to become more focused on the spots on the virus that don't change as frequently or are more effective at neutralizing it,\" Josh Petrie, associate research scientist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told CBS News.",
      "Petrie said that well-matched vaccines tend to correlate with higher effectiveness. But even with well-matched shots, he said that seasons with more H3N2 viruses often result in lower vaccine effectiveness estimates \u2014 and more severe seasons overall \u2014 compared to other circulating strains.",
      "\"As a rule of thumb, at least in recent years, effectiveness against H3N2 has typically been lower than H1N1. And also as a rule of thumb, H3N2 typically has a higher impact on older adults and you see a lot more hospitalizations,\" Petrie said.",
      "More data could come soon. The first estimates from CDC's influenza vaccine effectiveness studies for this season are expected to be released by the end of this month.",
      "The World Health Organization is also expected to release a report soon from a meeting to decide next season's influenza vaccine update.",
      "CDC officials are also being allowed to participate in the meeting, a spokesperson said, despite the president's order that has mostly banned U.S. scientists from talking with the WHO.",
      "Not all early data suggests this season's vaccines are a poor match. Data published last month from Canada found that vaccines looked to be 54% effective against H3N2 strains there.",
      "\"That's actually pretty good effectiveness for H3. Usually it's down in the 30 to 40[%] range,\" Petrie said.",
      "Scientists in the Canadian report said that a better-matched, updated vaccine strain might explain the higher vaccine effectiveness they found. But they also cautioned that some worrying mutations to H3N2 had also been spotted so far.",
      "\"Potential impact on VE [vaccine effectiveness] elsewhere and through the rest of the season requires further monitoring,\" they wrote.",

    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way.

    "summary": "As Los Angeles looks to recover from historic wildfires, previously unsheltered and chronically homeless people are facing even greater instability.",
    "story": [
      "ALTADENA, Calif. \u2014 As flames engulfed a nearby canyon, dozens of residents in a sober-living home fled to an unoccupied building about 30 miles south. The evacuees, many of whom were previously homeless, watched helplessly as their home burned on live TV.",
      "When they awoke on air mattresses the next morning, loss set in. Some feared uncertainty. Others were jolted back to lives they thought they'd left behind.",
      "\"I had nothing but the clothes on my back. It just brought back all of those feelings of being homeless and a drug addict,\" said one resident, Sean Brown. \"Kind of like I was back at square one.\"",
      "The large two-story Altadena house, known to staff and residents as Art House, was surrounded by fruit trees and rugged mountains. For many, it was a safe space that enabled them to achieve and maintain sobriety, rebuild relationships, and hold down jobs.",
      "Brown, 35, was among nearly 50 people displaced in January after the massive Eaton Fire destroyed one property and damaged another operated by the nonprofit Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. Supported by public dollars, the organization provides housing and behavioral health treatment to people struggling with addiction, many who had been living on the streets. Operators say both properties are uninhabitable and that they are searching for permanent housing for those displaced.",
      "\"Our residents are still in temporary lodging. Right now we're looking for something on an interim basis, but we still need to identify long-term housing for them,\" said Juan Navarro, CEO of the nonprofit. \"And we need even more beds. We're seeing even bigger demand for treatment and services after the fires.\"",
      "In the weeks since one of the nation's costliest natural disasters, it's become evident that the Los Angeles wildfires have not only displaced people who had dug themselves out of homelessness and gotten into housing, but also dealt a blow to the region's homelessness response. That far-reaching system of care formed by government agencies and local nonprofits has been buoyed by billions of dollars from the city, county, and state in recent years to combat California's homelessness epidemic.",
      "Now, wildfires are adding pressure to a system already under tremendous strain in getting chronically homeless people indoors. Homeless service operators and street medicine providers have been putting pressure on state and local leaders to allocate more funding to house people on the streets, but they are running up against competing demands for wildfire recovery \u2014 and tighter budgets.",
      "\"Many of the people we work with have already lost everything and they're trying to rebuild their lives, and now there's a whole other group of people doing the same thing and competing for the same resources,\" said Jennifer Hark Dietz a licensed clinical social worker and the CEO of PATH, which provides services and housing for homeless people.",
      "In recent years, state and local leaders have leveraged unprecedented investments to open thousands of shelters and temporary and permanent units. That's helped Los Angeles County and the state notch meaningful gains, even as more than 187,000 people remain homeless in California, including 75,000 people across Los Angeles County.",
      "The 2024 homelessness tally showed a 45% increase in the number of people who in the past year moved off the streets into permanent housing, and the number who moved from tents into temporary housing rose 32%, according to Va Lecia Adams Kellum, CEO of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which leads the countywide homelessness response system. That's nearly 30,000 permanent housing placements across Los Angeles County.",
      "And while homelessness rose 18% nationwide from 2023 to 2024, according to the most recent federal estimate, it increased only 3% in California. More strikingly, Los Angeles County reduced overall homelessness, albeit slightly.",
      "The number of people living outside fell 5.1% in Los Angeles County, and in the city of Los Angeles, the number of unsheltered people dropped 10.4%.",
      "That hard-fought progress is now in peril as the wildfires displaced tens of thousands of Los Angeles residents and destroyed more than 16,000 structures. Affordable housing, already in short supply, is being further strained.",
      "Formerly homeless people who have experienced addiction, domestic violence, or mental illness now worry they won't be prioritized for placements, despite losing their homes and qualifying for state and local homelessness initiatives to get people indoors. Many homeless people who have long waited for housing will be forced to wait even longer, as more displaced people face homelessness and compete for costly housing.",
      "Homeless again",
      "It's unclear how many formerly homeless people are homeless again. Street medicine providers and other front-line workers say some are temporarily living in hotels, while others moved in with friends or family members.",
      "There's evidence that some have fallen back into homelessness.",
      "\"We're already seeing some people have moved into their vehicles because they don't have the money to pay for even temporary housing,\" Adams Kellum said. \"Before the fires, we were already seeing very vulnerable people unable to manage their rents, so this competition for housing puts people at even greater risk for homelessness.\"",
      "Adams Kellum said coordinating resources and services across a vast region has led to major progress but that more money is needed to help move people from short-term to permanent housing.",
      "For now, residents of the burned-down Art House will be allowed to reside in an empty building in Santa Fe Springs that the nonprofit had planned to redevelop for residential treatment, Navarro said. He said the nonprofit is looking for more stable housing for those displaced but that rehousing them at Art House remains out of reach for now.",
      "Residents grieve the loss of the Art House's transformative setting, which they call an \"empowerment campus.\" Brown said that he has embraced that ethos, even as he has been displaced and remains traumatized by the wildfires. He is currently working two jobs and taking classes toward a bachelor's degree.",
      "Paul Rosales, a 24-year-old in recovery from meth, said Art House was a place of healing. \"That's where I found myself; it's where I built my recovery. There was a beautiful orange tree, and the mountains were just a short walk away where you could meditate and watch the sunset.",
      "\"It was away from Skid Row. I knew I was safe,\" Rosales said. \"That's all gone now.\"",
      "Residents say they're grateful they aren't on the streets, but anxiety grows by the day, especially for queer and transgender people who had formed a community there.",
      "\"It's constant stress of not knowing if I'm going to be in a stable housing situation,\" said Alexandria Castaneda, 29, who was addicted to meth but got sober after getting indoors.",
      "Battle for resources",
      "Sarah Hoppmeyer, chief program officer for Union Station Homeless Services, which provides housing for people on the streets, said she worries about dwindling resources. She and other providers stressed the importance of not overlooking people currently stuck in homelessness, many of whom have been waiting years for housing.",
      "\"We don't want the wildfires to de-prioritize people who were already experiencing homelessness,\" she said.",
      "Elected leaders have pledged to preserve the gains Los Angeles County has made in reducing homelessness by allocating existing resources and demanding more. Several voter-approved initiatives in Los Angeles are critical, they say, but so too is lobbying for state support.",
      "\"Without continued and expanded support and resources, we risk losing ground\" in reducing the number of people living on the streets, said Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, chair of the county board.",
      "Previous massive fires have led to increases in homelessness, including in 2018 in Sonoma County and in 2024 on Maui, whose homelessness rate soared the year after fires.",
      "State Sen. Sasha Ren\u00e9e P\u00e9rez, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Los Angeles County that burned in the wildfires, said she will continue pressing for additional homelessness funding as a member of the Senate budget committee. While Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration says the state has plowed an unprecedented $27 billion into local homelessness response and prevention initiatives, he didn't include any new money for battling the homelessness crisis in his proposal this year.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this year we didn't see additional money being placed into that fund,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"But we have to keep making these investments.\"",
      "Newsom said Monday the state should not continue to \"fund failure.\" He said he is open to negotiations with cities, counties, and state lawmakers so long as any new homelessness funding comes with greater accountability, meaning that local governments use the money to clear encampments, dismantle tents, and reduce unsheltered homelessness.",
      "Newsom officials stressed that the state budget is tight \u2014 it's narrowly balanced and under greater strain than in previous years, with threats from the Trump administration and the potential loss of critical federal funding for programs such as Medicaid. The governor said he is \"hopeful that we can land on an agreement,\" but he warned the state could claw back funding if local governments aren't adequately addressing street homelessness.",
      "\"We have been too permissive as it relates to encampments and tents. We need them cleaned up,\" Newsom said. \"We're providing unprecedented support. Now we need to see unprecedented results.\"",
      "Assembly member John Harabedian, another Los Angeles-area Democrat, said additional homelessness spending is critical for wildfire victims and to continue combating the crisis statewide.",
      "\"Those folks who were already homeless, who just got into some sort of housing stability but then lost it again \u2014 they're going to need immediate attention,\" he said. \"Our system is failing people.\"",

      "A new plant species called the Wooly Devil has been discovered at Big Bend National Park in Texas, the National Park Service announced Monday.",
      "The Wooly Devil, or Ovicula biradiata, was first spotted by botany volunteer Deb Manley and a park ranger in March 2024, according to the park service. The tiny, fuzzy-looking plants with yellow flowers growing among desert rocks in a remote area on the northern end of the park were not anything like they had seen before.",
      "After searching plant databases, consulting experts and even asking for answers online, park officials said they began to realize that they had found something special.",
      "It's the first time a new species of plant has been found at a U.S. national park in nearly 50 years, according to the California Academy of Sciences, which joined Big Bend National Park staff and Sul Ross State University to study the Wooly Devil.",
      "According to researchers, who published their findings in peer-reviewed botanical journal PhytoKeys, the Wooly Devil is in the daisy family and it is closely related to paperflowers and bitterweed, both of which have yellow flowers. However, DNA analysis showed that the plant is so genetically distinct that it had to be considered a new genus.",
      "The Wooly Devil is much smaller than its sister plants, according to the researchers, ranging from less than 1 centimeter to 3-7 centimeters across. It was given the formal name Ovicula, meaning tiny sheep, and biradiata, a reference to the two ray-like petals in each flower.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",

      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",

      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

      "Still, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square, with many of the roughly 4,000 assembled understanding they may be in Rome for Francis' final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff's legacy.",
      "\"To see him suffer hurts,\" said Robert Pietro, a Romanian seminarian who stood at the prayer holding a small, fragrant candle in tribute. \"But we also pray in thanksgiving for what he has done for the Church.\"",
      "Roberto Allison, a priest from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said members of his community had come together to show appreciation for \"all that we have learned from him.\"",
      "Stopping to deliver personal blessings to some at the end of the ceremony, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said the crowd's diversity - many world languages could be heard spoken - was \"a big sign of comfort\" for the Catholic Church.",
      "A couple of Catholic tourists from Chicago, who arrived holding umbrellas well before the service started, said they prayed for the pope at daily Mass earlier at St. Peter's Basilica, and decided to come back. Like many, they found it \"hard to process\" they may be in Rome for Francis' final days.",
      "\"No one knows the day and time, but it's a historic moment nonetheless,\" said Edward Burjek.",
      "It felt the same for Hatzumi Villanueva of Peru. She was particularly fond of former pope St. John Paul II but said Francis, as the first Latin American pope, \"draws a bit closer.\"",
      "\"We came to pray for the pope, that he may recover soon, for the great mission he's sharing with his message of peace,\" said Villanueva, who praised his empathy for migrants.",
      "Francis' papacy has also emphasized the defense of the environment and partial openness to LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Outside the Vatican, Romans, pilgrims and even non-Catholics said they were offering special prayers for the hospitalized pope.",
      "\"We are all sorry,\" said Raniero Mancinelli, who has tailored ceremonial clothing for Francis and the two previous popes in his shop just outside the Vatican's walls.",
      "Elisabetta Zumbo carried a 5-foot-long cross down a cordoned-off section of the street leading to St. Peter's as she prepared to lead a group of 34 pilgrims from the northern Italian city of Piacenza. With the rain pouring down, she pledged her group would pray intensely for the pope.",
      "\"There is a lot of emotion and a lot of sadness,\" Zumbo said.",
      "Nearby, a couple from London visiting St. Peter's with their son said that even though they're not Catholic, they felt close to the pontiff \"being there in his home\" in the monumental basilica.",

The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies previously projected a 3% chance of the asteroid striking our planet before lowering the chance to 0.28% last week.",

    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014 Provisional results confirmed that mainstream conservatives led by Friedrich Merz won Germany's national election, while a far-right party surged to become the nation's second-largest.",
      "The campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States.",
      "Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It's been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy.",
      "The Reuters news agency reports that, on his Truth Social platform, President Trump said, \"Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration, that has prevailed for so many years. This is a great day for Germany.\"",
      "Reuters reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a post on X three years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, congratulated Merz and said, \"We look forward to continuing our joint work with Germany to protect lives, bring real peace closer to Ukraine, and strengthen Europe.\"",
      "And, Reuters pointed out that, while congratulating Merz in a post on X, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he's \"looking forward to working with you in this crucial moment for our shared security. It's vital that Europe step up on defense spending and your leadership will be key.\"",
      "The results released by the electoral authority showed Merz's Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.",
      "That gives Merz the best chance of becoming the country's next chancellor. He said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest.",
      "He has ruled out a coalition with the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which Mr. Trump's adviser\u00a0Elon Musk has backed\u00a0in the elections and which is now Germany's second-largest party after its best showing ever.",
      "Merz's conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The incumbent Social Democrats won 120 seats and the Left party got 64.",
      "The left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just barely under the 5% hurdle needed to get seats in parliament, while the pro-business Free Democrats also failed to reach 5%.",
      "The AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country's main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The anti-immigrant, far-right party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn't yet been part of any state or national government.",
      "That's the result of what is often called a \"firewall\" against Alternative for Germany. Other parties say they won't work with the AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something that AfD objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \"proven right-wing extremist\" groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany's Nazi past.",

It said he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since Saturday and that the supplemental oxygen that he was using continued but with a slightly reduced oxygen flow and concentrations. The slight kidney insufficiency detected on Sunday was not causing alarm at the moment, doctors said, while saying his prognosis remained guarded.",

Gabriel Romanelli, who leads the Catholic community at the church, which during Israel's war had served as a shelter for Palestinians. Romanelli had reported hearing from Francis soon after he was hospitalized, but not since. He had sent Francis a video, and the pope called to thank him, the Vatican said.",
      "Earlier Monday, the Vatican had announced the start of nighttime prayers for the pope's health in St. Peter's Square, and invited Romans and others to join in, as he battles a complex lung infection and complications. The Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, planned to lead the first prayer on Monday evening.",
      "Francis, who has double pneumonia and the early stages of kidney insufficiency, was awake and in good spirits Monday. He was not in pain and was not receiving artificial nutrition, the Vatican said.",
      "\"The night passed well, the pope slept and is resting,\" it said.",
      "At the Gemelli hospital, where Francis has been since Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened, Bishop Claudio Giuliodori presided over an emotional, standing-room-only Mass in the chapel named for John Paul. Some of the estimated 200 people who attended were in white doctor's coats or green surgical scrubs; some knelt in prayer.",
      "\"We are very sorry. Pope Francis is a good pope, let's hope that he makes it. Let us hope,\" said a choked-up Filomena Ferraro, who was visiting a relative at Gemelli on Monday. \"We are joining him with our prayers but what else can we do?\"",
      "Doctors have said Francis' condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. They've warned that the main threat facing Francis is sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia.",
      "To date, there's been no reference to any onset of sepsis in the medical updates provided by the Vatican.",
      "This hospitalization now ties Francis' longest as pope. He spent 10 days at Gemelli hospital in 2021 after he had 13 inches of his colon removed.",
      "In New York on Sunday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan acknowledged what church leaders in Rome weren't saying publicly: that the Catholic faithful were united \"at the bedside of a dying father.\"",
      "\"As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health, and probably close to death,\" Dolan said in his homily from the pulpit of St. Patrick's Cathedral, though he later told reporters he hoped and prayed that Francis would \"bounce back.\"",

      "\"During that process of bringing the shark alongside, he's become tangled in the fishing line, and the shark has taken off, and that fishing line was pulled taut and maybe contributed to him going over the side of the vessel. There's no evidence to say that shark has attacked the person in the water,\" McNulty said at a news conference. He added that Barning wasn't wearing a life jacket.",

General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression. And the assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine.",
      "It marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That's lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia's aggression.",
      "The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.",
      "The vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting \"yes,\" the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting \"no.\"",
      "Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its \"inherent right to self-defense\" following Russia's invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter's requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.",
      "\"As we mark three years of this devastation \u2014 Russia's full invasion against Ukraine \u2014 we call on all nations to stand firm and to take \u2026 the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,\" she said.",
      "U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.\"",
      "\"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Shea said.",
      "The dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration's extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.",
      "In escalating rhetoric, Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast\" to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Mr. Trump was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space.\"",
      "Since then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine's U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Mr. Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.",
      "The U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.",
      "The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia's veto power.",
      "There are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.",
      "Since Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow's invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.",
      "The votes on the rival resolutions \u2014 which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said \u2014 will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Mr. Trump's effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.",
      "The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" and \"implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\" It never mentions Moscow's invasion.",
      "Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was \"a good move.\"",

    "story": [
      "Friedrich Merz, who is on course to become post-World War II Germany's 10th chancellor after the country's election, has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "Pulling a divided Europe together won't be easy when many leaders are too preoccupied by domestic issues to devote much energy to answer the continent's most pressing problems. But expectations will be high for Merz to help fill a leadership vacuum and craft a united response to recent U.S. policy shifts that have strained the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "\"All the signals we are getting from the USA indicate that interest in Europe is clearly waning and that the willingness to get involved in Europe is decreasing,\" Merz told reporters at a press conference on Monday.",
      "\"Nevertheless, I hope that we can convince the Americans that it is in our mutual interest that we continue to have good trans-Atlantic relations.\"",
      "Merz's task will be complicated by the need to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He has repeatedly pledged to not work with the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party despite their second-place finish, the AfD's best result in a national election since the far-right party was founded just 12 years ago.",
      "The 69-year-old conservative leader heads the center-right Union bloc, which won Germany's national election with 28.5% of the votes.",
      "\"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us,\" he told supporters after his victory Sunday night. \"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations.\"",
      "The top job has been late in coming for Merz, a lawyer by profession, who saw his ascent derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in the federal government.",
      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\"We are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\" she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",
      "He practiced law and headed the supervisory board of investment manager BlackRock's German branch. During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.",
      "\"Friedrich Merz is perhaps the most international chancellor Germany has had since the war \u2014 if he becomes chancellor,\" said Volker Resing, who wrote the recently published biography \"Friedrich Merz: His Path to Power.\"",
      "Merz \"relies on personal initiative, on the freedom of the individual, on creativity and motivation. And only secondarily on the state,\" Resing said.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates more in Merkel's mold in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "Merz persisted and was elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz's \"way of doing politics\" is not to avoid confrontation at all costs. Instead, he maintains a perspective that \"a certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\"",
      "During the election campaign, Merz has vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong trans-Atlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "\"I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\" he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure ... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\"",
      "Merz will be under pressure to help solve some of Europe's most urgent problems, according to Wolfgang Merkel, a political analyst from the WBZ Berlin Social Science Center, but \"we shouldn't expect to hear one voice out of Brussels.\"",
      "\"The interests are so different within the European Union, including the political majorities, that we shouldn't expect a resounding common EU policy,\" he said and added that it will likely \"be the usual game of muddling through.\"",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right AfD party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz's tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Since then, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest against both Merz's motion and also the rise of the far right, like the AfD, which has been placed under surveillance for suspected extremism by German intelligence.",
      "During the campaign, the AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, pledged to carry out the mass deportation of immigrants, outraging many Germans.",
      "\"We know what happened in Germany in the '30s, and it feels a bit like this is happening again, and this makes me really afraid of the future,\" one protester in Berlin said.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to never work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany's parliament \u2014 an area where people are \"rather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\" Resing said. \"That's what shaped him: rural life.\"",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",

      "\"Traditional Zambian societies and individuals believe in a strong relationship between the human world and the supernatural,\" Moyo said.",

The men also face charges of cruelty to animals.",
      "Police said one man confessed they had been hired for a curse to kill Hichilema. He testified in court they were promised more than $1 million.",

      "Zambia's judiciary had said it would allow this trial to be broadcast live on television, which would have been just the second time that's happened for a trial.

      "When the trial opened last week, the courtroom was packed.",
      "Many traditional beliefs have survived in Zambia alongside its official Christian religion. A study by the Zambia Law Development Commission, which has a mandate to reform laws, found that 79% of Zambians believed in the existence of witchcraft as of 2018.",
      "The study was conducted because the Witchcraft Act has been questioned.",
      "It was passed in 1914 when Zambia was part of the British \"sphere of influence.\" The act defines practicing witchcraft as pretending to exercise any kind of supernatural power, witchcraft, sorcery or enchantment calculated to cause fear, annoyance or injury.",
      "Witchcraft cases have been difficult to prosecute in Zambia, with evidence tricky to collect. The cases are normally heard in traditional courts, and this is a rare one to reach the magistrates court in Lusaka. The penalty for practicing witchcraft is a fine or up to two years in jail, with the possibility of hard labor.",

Little in the royal household happens by accident. It\u2019s totally deliberate, as King Charles is doing everything possible to distance himself from his scandal-ridden brother.\"",

      "\"She would\u2019ve made a provision for him, and maybe that provision came through his elder brother as monarch,\" she shared. \"When the king dies or the queen dies, the money goes to the next monarch.

      "\"It\u2019s not just a little house in the middle of nowhere,\" said Seward. \"It is huge and therefore needs a lot of upkeep. But I think that there\u2019s no way he and Charles would\u2019ve had a row about it, because Charles isn\u2019t like that.\"",
      "\"He wouldn\u2019t have said, 'You\u2019ve got to get out,'\" Seward insisted. \"He would\u2019ve suggested why it would be easier to get out. And Andrew said, \u2018No, I want to stay.\u2019 So, Charles said, \u2018Fine, but I\u2019m going to have to remove this very expensive security, and we\u2019ll need to find an alternative.'\"",

      "How much can be learned from the daily or twice-daily Vatican announcements and from media reports?",

      "POPE FRANCIS\u2019 MEDICAL CONDITION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERAL PNEUMONIA",
      "The pope has a long history of medical problems, including respiratory infections. Back in 1957, he had a piece of one lung removed.",
      "(Despite this, Pope Francis is not a smoker, and in fact ordered a ban on the sale of cigarettes in the Vatican\u2019s duty-free shop beginning in 2018.)",
      "Pope Francis holds the Holy Book of Prayers as he celebrates the Epiphany mass on January 6, 2020, at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.\u00a0 (Vincenzo Pinto/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The Catholic leader was last hospitalized for pneumonia in 2023. He previously underwent abdominal surgery, when part of his colon was removed.",
      "Most recently, the pope was hospitalized for a respiratory infection on Feb. 14, 2025, at Gemelli Hospital, one of the best hospitals in Italy.",
      "What is the pope's medical condition?",
      "The pope's condition has been described as bilateral pneumonia, which generally appears as consolidation on a chest x-ray or CT scan.",
      "Pneumonia is an infection in the air sacs of the lung. Bilateral pneumonia is more problematic and difficult to recover from than unilateral pneumonia or pneumonia in one lobe, especially in an elderly patient with scarring from previous surgeries and bouts of pneumonia.",
      "The pope is presumably being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is reportedly non-septic.",
      "LUNG CANCER RISING AMONG NON-SMOKERS \u2014 HERE'S WHY",

      "Given that the pope has likely been given antibiotics for several days and appears to be stable, the chances of him developing sepsis are greatly reduced.",
      "What is sepsis?",
      "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition of hemodynamic compromise (where the body is not getting enough blood flow to function properly), which causes a drop in blood pressure.",

      "\"Although the pope's prognosis is currently unknown, it doesn\u2019t sound like he is truly in critical condition.\"",
      "Often, a septic patient needs special drugs (pressors) to maintain blood pressure, and toxins and acid (lactate) can build up in the blood.",
      "Blood cultures can turn positive with a pathogen, which in this case would presumably be a bacteria.",
      "Why is the pope on oxygen?",
      "The pope is receiving what is known as high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (a device that provides extra oxygen through a tube and into the nose), which can vary in oxygen percentage.",
      "This is a treatment for respiratory decompensation (breathing difficulties), but is not as aggressive as CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or mechanical ventilation.",

      "Reports of complications",

      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",

      "Richard Glossip has been granted a new trial by the Supreme Court. (Oklahoma Department of Corrections via AP, File)",

On the merits, it finds a due process violation based on patently immaterial testimony about a witness\u2019s medical condition,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion. \"And, for the remedy, it orders a new trial in violation of black-letter law on this Court\u2019s power to review state-court judgments.\"",
      "Glossip has always maintained his innocence. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s top criminal appeals court had repeatedly upheld the conviction and sentence, even after the state sided with Glossip.",

      "In 2023, state Attorney General Gentner Drummond said new evidence persuaded him that Glossip\u2019s trial was not fair. Drummond has said he does not believe Glossip is innocent and has suggested he could face a new trial.",
      "If Glossip were to be tried again, the death penalty would be off the table, Oklahoma County District Attorney Vicki Zemp Behenna has said.",
      "Among Drummond\u2019s concerns are that prosecutors knew Sneed lied on the witness stand about his psychiatric condition and his reason for taking the mood-stabilizing drug lithium. Drummond also has cited a box of evidence in the case that was destroyed, including motel receipts, a shower curtain and masking tape that Glossip\u2019s attorney, Don Knight, said could have potentially proven Glossip\u2019s innocence.",

      "And yet there\u2019s an interesting thought exercise here. Trump says a lot of things, especially since he talks to journalists at length virtually every day. Not everything rises to the same level of seriousness. I say this as someone who has interviewed him many times over the years, including our sit-down two weeks before the election.",

      "At the top of the list right now would be Ukraine. President Trump is a smart guy. He knows that Russia invaded its much smaller sovereign neighbor with the aim of wiping it off the map and putting it under Moscow\u2019s control.

      "Of course, Trump has cozied up to Putin for a long time. During their Helsinki summit in the first term, the president accepted Putin\u2019s denial that the Kremlin had hacked into Democratic emails, despite the evidence gathered by his own intelligence agencies.",

      "Councilwoman Sharon Durkan, who accused Homan of spending his career \"policing a town smaller than a Fenway Park crowd,\" posted a clarification shortly after a Fox News Digital request for comment on Sunday evening.",
      "\"Yes, I understand that Tom Homan spent his career as a federal agent within Border Patrol & ICE, but that\u2019s a world away from the realities of policing a major city,\" Durkan explained. \"His background is in immigration enforcement, not community policing \u2013 where trust and accountability are key.\"",
      "The Smith College graduate raised eyebrows after mocking Homan's brief stint as a police officer in West Carthage, New York, implying that he was unqualified to enforce President Donald Trump's border policy in Boston because of that experience. But Homan's time in the small-town department only lasted from 1983 to 1984, before he became a Border Patrol agent and eventually worked his way through the ranks of the Obama and Trump administrations.",

      "\"I'm coming to Boston, and I'm bringing hell with me,\" Homan said during his speech. \"I looked at the numbers this morning... I stopped counting at nine. Nine child rapists that were in jail in Massachusetts, but rather than honoring an ICE detainer, you released them back into the street.\"",
      "\"You're not a police commissioner,\" the Trump administration official added. \"Take that badge off your chest. Put it in the desk drawer. Because you became a politician. You forgot what it\u2019s like to be a cop.\"",
      "Massachusetts and the greater Boston area have seen several arrests of criminal migrants in recent weeks, including an illegal immigrant connected to a violent Brazilian gang who was recently arrested in Bellingham. Cox has previously said that his department \"doesn't enforce detainers\" that are filed by ICE, and that Boston cops \"abide by Boston law and Massachusetts law.\"",
      "\"The Boston Police Department has pretty defined rules and we abide by the law here in the state,\" the police chief said on a segment of WCVB\u2019s \"On the Record\" show. \"We don\u2019t enforce civil detainers regarding federal immigration law. It's defined here in the state, and that\u2019s just how it works.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., reacts to DOGE's revelation that millions of Americans aged 110-360 are still in the Social Security database and the department's imminent access to the IRS data retrieval system.",
      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health.

      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",

      "Take security questions, for example. They're pretty repetitive: your mother's maiden name, your first pet's name, your favorite elementary school teacher. A hacker does not need to know how to script a single line of code to break into your accounts; it's often enough that they know these things about you and can convince your mobile carrier to activate a SIM card in your name.",
      "This is all, let's not mince words, scary, especially if you've just sold a vehicle or property and have the proceeds lying around or a nest egg account set aside for your retirement, because scammers and hackers can easily find out about title or deed transfers through data brokers like people finder sites.",
      "Refuse to engage",
      "Scary as it is, it's also simple to protect against. Simple, but not always easy. If you just refuse to engage with these people, never giving up even a scrap of information, your risks of getting scammed or hacked plummet. Keep your personal information out of circulation in the first place (using a data removal service, for example), and they drop to almost zero.",

      "When to hang up",
      "So, once faced with a suspicious call, the solution is simply to hang up as soon as something seems off. And when is that, exactly? The moment someone calls you out of the blue and requires you to give or confirm any personal information. This could be the last four digits of your Social Security number, your address, which credit card company you're with \u2014 anything that concerns you, specifically. If the caller turns up the pressure and starts trying to get you to stay on the line, either by enticing you with \"rewards\" or even threatening you with dire consequences, then you can be absolutely sure the call is not legitimate.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The red herring of legitimacy",
      "But what if the call is legitimate? What if you hang up on someone who was only doing their job? What if they were truly trying to help you? These are the doubts that scammers and hackers play upon to ply their trades. We're all vulnerable to tactics like these, especially if caught off guard. Older adults are particularly vulnerable.\u00a0Studies suggest that older people \u2014 who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year \u2014 are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions. Older people are also more likely to put stock in good manners, finding it more difficult than younger adults to directly or indirectly question a caller's intentions, let alone cut them off mid-sentence and hang up on them.",

      "Why call center staff won't ask for personal information",
      "So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the\u00a0\u2018Do Not Call\u2019 list loophole.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls:\u00a0These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.",
      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's Key Takeaways",
      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information \u2014 something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "A new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Laura Ingraham asks why there are so many plane crashes on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "In 2008, American Airlines became the first major U.S. carrier to charge for checked bags, introducing a $15 fee as part of a cost-cutting measure. Since then, other airlines have adopted similar fees, with prices steadily increasing over the years. Now, a new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",

      "The changing landscape of airline weight policies",
      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight, but it didn't catch on widely.",
      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",
      "Researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",
      "The airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

      "Although there's interest in weight-based charges, societal norms and the potential for discrimination make it challenging to address. As airlines continue exploring new ways to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact, it\u2019s clear that any move toward weight-based pricing will need to carefully consider fairness and public perception.",

Now, the shipping industry has joined the list, with a major global shipper that works with Amazon, eBay and Shopify exposing 14 million records.",

Hipshipper helps people ship packages to over 150 countries, offering tracking, free insurance and easy returns. The exposed shipping labels are important because they detail what's inside the packages and where they\u2019re supposed to go.",

Unfortunately, retail companies are a prime target for hackers, and relying on large, well-known firms doesn\u2019t always protect your information.

These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Watch out for snail mail:\u00a0While many security threats happen online, physical mail can also be a target. With home addresses exposed in data leaks, criminals may send fraudulent letters or fake invoices to trick you into providing further personal information or making payments. If you receive suspicious mail, avoid responding and report it to the company it claims to be from.",
      "3) Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won't be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports regularly: You can request free credit reports from major credit bureaus to check for any suspicious activity or unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "6) Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "7)\u00a0Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams by removing your personal information from the web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s high time every industry took cybersecurity seriously. If your business operates online, you are just as responsible for protecting customer data as a tech company, possibly even more so, since tech companies typically have stronger safeguards in place. The fact that Hipshipper left a storage bucket containing 14 million records unprotected speaks volumes about how little they prioritize cybersecurity. And it's not just Hipshipper. Many companies dealing with tech products aren\u2019t even careful enough to password-protect their critical documents. This lack of basic security highlights a worrying trend across industries.",

    "summary": "Major IoT data breach: Mars Hydro database with 2.7 billion records exposed. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says the breach is a reminder of the risks that come with using IoT devices.",
    "story": [
      "Data breaches keep happening, and too often they come down to companies failing to take cybersecurity seriously. Some of the biggest breaches have been caused by negligence, and now there\u2019s another major one to add to the list. Mars Hydro, a Chinese company that makes Internet of Things (IoT) devices like LED lights and hydroponics equipment, left a massive database unprotected online. As a result, 2.7 billion records were exposed to anyone who knew where to look.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips\u2014sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now",
      "Illustration of IoT devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened?",
      "Mars Hydro, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT devices, suffered a massive data breach after a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing nearly 2.7 billion records was discovered online. The 1.17-terabyte database was not password-protected or encrypted, exposing a massive amount of sensitive information related to the company\u2019s smart devices, including LED grow lights and hydroponic equipment.",
      "The database contained logging, monitoring and error records for IoT devices sold worldwide. Among the exposed data were Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs), Wi-Fi passwords, IP addresses, device ID numbers and other details linked to user devices and the Mars Pro IoT software application. Plus, internal records referenced LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED, a California-registered company, as well as Spider Farmer, which produces agricultural equipment.",
      "Security researcher\u00a0Jeremiah Fowler identified the database and immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to LG-LED SOLUTIONS and Mars Hydro. Within hours, public access to the database was restricted.",
      "It remains unclear how long the database was publicly accessible or whether any unauthorized parties accessed the data before its restriction. The only way to confirm potential access or misuse would be through an internal forensic audit, but no such investigation has been publicly disclosed.",
      "Illustration of using an app to access smart home devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Should you be worried?",
      "The unprotected database contained highly sensitive user and device information, including SSIDs and passwords stored in plain text, which could allow unauthorized users to access home networks. Although the researcher did not indicate that any personally identifiable information was exposed, the presence of network credentials, IP addresses, device ID numbers and data about smartphones running the IoT software raises serious security concerns.",
      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",

      "FROM TIKTOK TO TROUBLE: HOW YOUR ONLINE DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",
      "5) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may try to exploit the data from this breach by launching phishing attacks. If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Mars Hydro breach is yet another reminder of the security risks that come with IoT devices. Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:44:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Dan Bongino, the conservative podcaster named deputy director of the FBI, has spent the past seven years publicly criticizing the agency he will now help run.",
    "story": [
      "Dan Bongino, the conservative podcaster named deputy director of the FBI, has spent the past seven years publicly criticizing the agency he will now help run, pushing conspiracy theories about corrupt FBI leadership and agents who were out to get President Donald Trump.",
      "A survey of Bongino\u2019s podcast transcripts by NBC News from 2017 to 2025 found that he made the FBI a regular target on his show, routinely claiming that the bureau colluded with the so-called deep state, an alleged shadowy network of entrenched federal and military operatives. Those themes figured heavily on \u201cThe Dan Bongino Show,\u201d a syndicated radio show and daily podcast that is among the most popular in the U.S.",
      "Along the way, Bongino has gone from a relatively unknown conservative pundit to one of the most followed and recognizable pro-Trump voices in all of media, commanding an audience of millions across various platforms.",
      "\u201cThe FBI has totally and completely failed America,\u201d Bongino said in a June 2024 episode of his podcast, a sentiment typical of his attacks on the bureau. \u201cIt kills me to have to tell you that you can\u2019t trust these people, you cannot.\u201d",
      "Bongino has also espoused an extreme view on the law and power, saying in May 2024: \u201cPower. That is all that matters,\u201d as part of a critique of the Biden administration\u2019s effort to forgive student loans before going on to laugh at the idea of checks and balances in the government. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s really funny.\u201d",
      "The FBI declined to comment. Bongino addressed his critics Monday on his podcast, appearing to strike a slightly more leveled tone while still implying that the FBI had been corrupted.",
      "\u201cI get it, if you are a political opponent of mine that has been involved with proudly celebrating a weaponized justice system, how you don\u2019t understand how a guy like me who discusses partisan content in an opinion show and go and do (an) unquestionably nonpartisan job,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a simple question. Have you seen what I did before I came here?\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cI\u2019m committed to service. People play different roles in their lives. People are dads, people are soccer coaches. People are cops and military officers and military enlisted people. People are carpenters, people are plumbers. We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.\u201d",
      "The deputy director is second-in-command of the FBI, and the job has traditionally been filled by a career agent who manages daily operations across the bureau\u2019s 55 field offices. The job, like other comparable posts, does not require approval from the Senate.",
      "But neither Bongino nor FBI Director Kash Patel have ever served in the agency they will now lead, and their public criticism of the FBI and embrace of misinformation and partisanship is raising questions about how they will run the FBI, even as they insist they are going to wipe the agency clean of politics.",
      "On Bongino\u2019s podcast from May 2017 through Monday, there were more than 21,000 mentions of \u201cFBI\u201d or \u201cdeep state,\u201d according to data from the KnowledgeFight podcast database. Mentions peaked in June 2023, the month Trump was indicted for obstruction and other crimes after federal officials accused him of hoarding classified documents. The case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "Bongino wasn\u2019t always critical of the bureau; in episodes from early 2017 and before, he maintained a fairly deferential tone. But in the later months of that year, things shifted.",
      "He started discussing conspiracy theories that the Obama administration had illegally spied on Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign with the FBI, despite a lack of evidence.",
      "And by the end of Trump\u2019s first year in office, Bongino had come to a revelation, he said, claiming in a Dec. 14, 2017 episode that he believed that FBI leadership had interfered in the U.S. election by collecting information about Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign in an attempt to rig the election for Democrat Hillary Clinton. At the time, the FBI was, in fact, heavily criticized for releasing information about Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server for official public communications.",
      "He\u2019s also been one of the loudest supporters of unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen, railing often about what he said was a coordinated effort from Democratic politicians and groups to manipulate social media, voting laws, poll workers and vote-by-mail to throw the election to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Biden won in 2020; there was no widespread voter fraud, according to members of Trump\u2019s own administration. But Bongino warned that without addressing these alleged injustices, the same \u201ccabal\u201d would interfere in the 2024 election.",
      "Bongino\u2019s criticism of the FBI initially focused on top officials who he claimed were partisan. But after the FBI obtained a search warrant to recover classified documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home, Bongino called for larger-scale firings at the agency: \u201cEvery person involved in this has to be fired immediately,\u201d he said in an August 2022 Fox & Friends interview. \u201cAnd then when the left starts whining in the media, fire 100 more the next day. Do not even let them breathe, everyone has to go, you do not even live in a constitutional republic anymore, and there is no fixing this, there is only rebuilding it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say for the 10th or 20th time this week, this is why the FBI must be disbanded,\u201d Bongino said on a September 2022 episode. \u201cYou understand this is going to get worse, you\u2019re not going to fix this. The organization needs to be disbanded.\u201d",
      "Bongino escalated his attacks on the FBI in 2023, characterizing the agency as a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the United States. Bongino accused the FBI of systemic corruption, alleging that it colluded with foreign governments, spread disinformation, suppressed information related to Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and interfered in elections.",
      "He frequently targeted then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, calling his leadership an embarrassment and suggesting that the agency had become a tool for political oppression. Bongino also claimed that the FBI actively suppressed information about COVID-19, violated the First Amendment and targeted Donald Trump and conservatives.",
      "Bongino continued to make the call to disband the FBI through 2024.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely clear how Bongino entered the running for the deputy director position.",
      "He does have law enforcement experience, having served in the U.S. Secret Service, on details for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He was also in the New York Police Department.",
      "Since then, he\u2019s been in Trump\u2019s orbit as a conservative commentator. He worked on Fox News from 2021 through 2023, and was chosen to host a radio show in the same time slot as Rush Limbaugh after his 2021 death.",
      "Bongino will be one of nearly two-dozen former Fox News personalities in Trump\u2019s administration, a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Trump similarly staffed his first administration with several of the network\u2019s employees.",
      "In July, conservative-leaning publication The Daily Signal published a YouTube interview with Bongino in which he said he would be open to leading the FBI \u201cif President Trump called.\u201d",
      "In November 2024, shortly after Trump\u2019s election, Bongino began lobbying on Patel\u2019s behalf to his listeners, urging them to share positive endorsements for Patel\u2019s FBI director nomination on social media.",
      "\u201cFolks, we need Kash Patel at FBI. As far as I\u2019m concerned right now, he is the only guy who knows where the bodies are buried and go in there and clean that mess up, we got to get Kash,\u201d Bongino said in a Nov. 19 episode of his podcast. Since the election, he has brought up Patel in at least 40 separate episodes.",
      "To take the position at the FBI, Bongino has to give up his microphone. Trump said in his announcement that Bongino was \u201cwilling and prepared.\u201d",
      "\u201cGreat news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!\u201d Trump said in a social media post announcing the appointment."

      "A robotic moon lander is set to launch into space this week, marking the second lunar mission for a company that made history a year ago by becoming the first private company to successfully land on the moon\u2019s surface.",
      "The spacecraft, known as Athena, was built by the Texas-based Intuitive Machines. It will carry a drill and set of instruments to study the chemical makeup of rocks and soil beneath the moon\u2019s surface.",
      "The mission is part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, which the space agency set up to support the development of moon landers by private-sector companies.",
      "The targeted landing site is a plateau in the moon's south polar region, on a towering, flat-topped mountain called Mons Mouton.",
      "The lunar south pole is of particular interest to NASA because\u00a0water ice is thought to be relatively abundant\u00a0in the area\u2019s permanently shadowed craters.

The Athena mission, in particular, will look for the presence of possible subsurface water, which could be a critical resource for future crewed missions to the moon.",

    "summary": "The Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act proposed by Sen. Dick Durbin would prevent new users from spending more than $2,000 in a day at a bitcoin ATM.",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin announced legislation Tuesday that would institute sweeping new regulations for the nation\u2019s crypto ATM industry.",
      "The machines have come under increasing scrutiny as the kiosks are used for scams where victims have lost thousands of dollars \u2014 in a single visit.",
      "The Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act would prevent new users from spending more than $2,000 in a day or $10,000 over a 14-day period to purchase cryptocurrency at a bitcoin ATM. The bill would also require companies to speak directly with new customers seeking to make transactions over $500 and mandate full refunds when those users file a police report and alert operators within 30 days of their transaction.",
      "\u201cAs our technology has evolved and become more sophisticated, so have scammers,\u201d Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. \u201cNefarious actors are now using intimidation and manipulation to scare Americans, particularly seniors, into dumping their life savings into cryptocurrency ATMs.\u201d The bill, he said, would \u201chelp curb the efficacy of these scams.\u201d",
      "At least $114 million in losses from scams involving bitcoin ATMs were reported to the Federal Trade Commission in 2023. Advocates and law enforcement say older adults are particularly vulnerable to such crimes.",
      "NBC News has previously reported on the scams, which advocates say have proliferated in the wake of regulatory gaps. Some victims have been falsely led to believe they were facing arrest or owed fines for missing jury duty.",
      "Eric Reisman, a 67-year-old retired special education teacher, said he fell for a jury duty scam in January. The Baltimore County resident said he lost $7,000 after paying the supposed fine by feeding bills into a bitcoin ATM. \u00a0It\u2019s possible, he said, that there was a warning at the machine that he skipped past.",
      "\u201cI was hypnotized, that\u2019s the best I can say,\u201d Reisman said. \u201cWhy would I have spent four and half hours on this thing and not woken up?\u201d",
      "Having an interaction with a customer service representative might have helped break the spell, he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody called me and said, \u2018Wait a second, what are you doing? Why are you putting in so much money, and do you have more money you\u2019re going to put in?\u2019 that would have saved me as well,\u201d Reisman said.",
      "The Senate bill comes as the kiosks have become more accessible, popping up in gas stations and grocery stores in communities across the United States.",
      "Consumer watchdogs have pushed for federal oversight of the industry. At least three states \u2014 Minnesota, California and Vermont \u2014 already have daily transaction limits for bitcoin ATMs. The Senate bill says it will defer to state regulations, provided they are not in conflict or less stringent.",
      "In the fall, Durbin led an inquiry from a group of Democratic senators questioning how the country\u2019s 10 largest bitcoin ATM operators were protecting elderly users from scams.",
      "The companies said they required users to acknowledge warnings about potential fraud and most set daily transaction limits around $25,000.",
      "NBC News reached out to three crypto ATM operators \u2014 Bitcoin Depot, CoinFlip and Athena Bitcoin \u2014 for comment on Durbin's legislation.\u00a0These companies operate the most bitcoin ATMs\u00a0in the U.S., according to Coin ATM Radar, a website that tracks them.",
      "A spokesperson for CoinFlip said in a statement that the kiosks are used by thousands daily for \u201clegitimate transactions,\u201d calling them \u201ccritical\u201d to the cryptocurrency sphere.",
      "\u201cWe support legislation that includes strong and consistent protections for consumers, while preserving their right to access digital currencies, and we look forward to working with Sen. Durbin on this important issue,\u201d the statement read.",
      "A spokesperson for Bitcoin Depot declined to comment.\u00a0Athena Bitcoin did not immediately respond.",
      "When similar regulations have been debated at the state level, some companies have argued they might still be evaded if scammers simply directed victims to go to more than one site.",
      "If the bill passes, the Treasury Department could fine companies $10,000 for each day violations persist.",
      "Americans for Financial Reform is one of several watchdog groups that have endorsed the legislation. Mark Hays, its associate director for cryptocurrency and financial technology, says the legislation as a \u201cgood first step\u201d in tackling practices within the crypto industry that have allowed fraud to flourish.",

      "Rebecca Marodi was found with multiple stab wounds on Feb. 17 at her home in Ramona, northeast of San Diego, the department has said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "A possible motive in the killing remains unclear.",
      "Rebecca Marodi worked for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection for more than three decades, beginning as a volunteer firefighter in 1993 in an area east of Los Angeles, the agency said. She was promoted to captain in 2022.",
      "She had been married to Yolanda Marodi for a little over two years, NBC San Diego reported. A photo on Rebecca Marodi\u2019s Facebook page showed them together at a cidery on Yolanda Marodi\u2019s birthday in December.",
      "Yolanda Marodi previously admitted to killing her estranged husband, James Olejniczak, in October 2000, according to NBC San Diego.",
      "Citing divorce records filed months before the death, the station reported Monday that she had sought custody of the couple's children and claimed irreconcilable differences as the reason for their divorce.",
      "Court records show Yolanda Marodi, then known as Yolanda Olejniczak, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 2004 and was sentenced to 13 years in prison on that charge and for possession of paraphernalia, drugs or alcohol in jail, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.",
      "She was released in 2013 and remained on parole until 2015, according to the spokesperson."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 02:00:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A man is fighting to get a Social Security number and birth certificate for his toddler, Caroline \u2014 whose name is listed in state records as \u201cUnakite Thirteen Hotel.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "A Nebraska man is fighting to get a Social Security number and valid birth certificate for his toddler, Caroline \u2014 whose name is incorrectly listed in state records as \u201cUnakite Thirteen Hotel.\u201d",
      "Jason Kilburn, who lives outside of Omaha, has been desperately trying to obtain a Social Security card and a useable birth certificate for Caroline. Without these documents, he said, he has been unable to get any services for her, from health insurance to child care, because they all require a Social Security number to verify her identity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s a ghost,\u201d Kilburn said in a phone interview Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very taxing.\u201d",
      "Caroline was born in November 2022 in a house just over the state border in Council Bluffs, Iowa, to a mother who immediately handed her over to a Nebraska foster family, Kilburn said. He and Caroline\u2019s mother had dated on and off for several years but were not together when she gave birth, he said, and it was only later that he learned of Caroline\u2019s arrival.",
      "Once Kilburn took a DNA test proving he was the girl\u2019s father, the juvenile court relinquished custody from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees foster care, to him. The mother, who faces allegations of neglect and drug problems, has no custody rights, an attorney for Kilburn said. Attempts to reach Caroline\u2019s birth mother on Monday were unsuccessful.",
      "As Kilburn tried to gather basic paperwork for his daughter once she was in his custody, he quickly realized that something was wrong: In the exchange between Caroline\u2019s birth mother in Iowa and the foster family in Nebraska, instead of a birth certificate, the girl had received only a certificate of live birth \u2014 an unofficial document that hospitals submit to start the process of generating government-issued birth certificates.",
      "Further complicating the matter, the certificate of live birth listed a bizarre name on it: Unakite Thirteen Hotel.",
      "Kilburn said he contacted CHI Health Mercy Council Bluffs, the hospital that issued the document, and received little guidance on how to proceed. But he did get a potential explanation for where the name on the document came from.",
      "\u201cI was told it was a computer-generated name,\u201d he said.",
      "Kilburn then learned that his daughter did not have a Social Security number. He is now working with Joshua Livingston, an attorney at the Koenig | Dunne law firm in Omaha, to try to push the state of Nebraska to resolve the matter. Livingston called the quagmire \u201ca circuitous, bureaucratic loop.\u201d",
      "Neither CHI Health Mercy Council Bluffs nor the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services immediately replied to a request for comment Monday. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said information about children in state custody is confidential.",
      "\u201cDHHS is working with the child\u2019s father\u2019s attorney to resolve this issue. The Department cannot go into any further detail,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email.",
      "\u201cEach state is responsible for all vital events that happen within the state including births and deaths as well as the registration of the event, the certificate, and any amendments or corrections needed,\u201d the statement added.",
      "In an email to NBC News on Monday afternoon, the Social Security Administration indicated it was looking into the case.",
      "\u201cPrivacy laws preclude Social Security from discussing the specifics of an individual\u2019s case.\u00a0 However, we can share that the agency is reaching out to Mr. Kilburn directly,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "But as of Monday evening, Kilburn had not yet been contacted by the Social Security Administration.",
      "There have been attempts to help Caroline get what she needs. In March 2023, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services filed a motion in juvenile court in Douglas County, Nebraska, seeking a court order \u201callowing NDHHS to establish a legal name for the above-named minor child as Unakite Thirteen Hotel\u201d so it could temporarily use her incorrect name to get an official birth certificate that it planned to use to get her a Social Security number.",
      "The court granted the motion, and Livingston said the Nebraska DHHS received a birth certificate listing Unakite Hotel as the child\u2019s name that said \u201cfor government use only.\u201d But the agency never followed through with getting her a Social Security number, he said. Livingston filed a motion in December 2024 seeking to reopen the matter, which the court denied.",
      "He said the Nebraska DHHS recently contacted him to say they were in touch with a counterpart in Iowa to work on the issue, but he has not received any updates. He is planning to file a motion in the coming days to ask the court if the birth certificate that said \u201cfor government use only\u201d can be amended so it has Kilburn\u2019s name on it, which should enable him to use the birth certificate to apply for a Social Security number himself.",
      "In the meantime, the legal limbo has put Kilburn and Caroline in a precarious position.",
      "He\u2019s currently not working due to a heart problem and was denied Medicaid and other services for Caroline because he could not provide a Social Security number for her. A simple check-up for Caroline at the pediatrician\u2019s office recently cost Kilburn about $700, he said, making him hesitant about going to other doctor\u2019s visits.",
      "\u201cThree or four weeks ago, she was sick. She had a fever and she was throwing up, and I had to weigh my options about what I was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really sucks to sit here and watch her suffer when there\u2019s health care out there that I can\u2019t get because of this.\u201d",
      "He also is unable to enroll Caroline in day care, speech therapy, or other early intervention services that he feels she may qualify for.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to pull something here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is stuff she\u2019s entitled to as any American is.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said that Caroline \u2014 whose full name, once he can get an actual birth certificate, will be Caroline Elizabeth Kilburn \u2014 is doing well overall.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a joy to be around,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t show signs of any trauma from any of this.\u201d"

      "Yoon faces being removed from office less than three years into his five-year presidency if the court upholds parliament\u2019s impeachment, which accused him of declaring martial law on December 3 with no justifiable constitutional grounds.",
      "Lee Kwang-beom, one of the lawyers for parliament, compared Yoon to previous autocratic South Korean leaders including Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan.",
      "Yoon wanted to create a world where his every word would be written into the constitution, and sought to privatize the country and reign over the constitution, Lee argued.",
      "\u201cWe call this dictatorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moment he declared martial law, he effectively gave up on his position as the president of our democratic republic.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf I am appearing before you it\u2019s because one day, when most of these people were just children, I committed hideous acts,\u201d Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec said in a sober voice after Judge Aude Buresi, the president of a five-judge panel hearing the case, asked if he had a statement to make.",
      "Le Scouarnec, who was wearing a black coat and glasses, added that he was prepared to take responsibility for his actions \u201cand the consequences they may have had and may have for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how many victims the 74-year-old was referring to in his brief statement at the Palais de Justice in Vannes, a small town in Brittany, northwestern France.",
      "Defense lawyer Maxime Tessier told reporters outside court that Le Scouarnec, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence for the abuse of four other children, has admitted to the \u201cvast majority,\u201d of the charges but not all of them.",
      "Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, 42, who has accused the surgeon of raping her when she was just 9 years old and under anesthesia, is expected to testify against him during the trial, told NBC News she \u201cdidn\u2019t think much\u201d of Le Scouarnec\u2019s words.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really believe he is sincere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s good that they made him give this little speech. We\u2019ve always said he was silent.\u201d",
      "Sol\u00e8ne Podevin, the president of the Confronting Incest Association, also pointed out that he had acknowledges responsibility, \u201cbut not necessarily for all the acts.\u201d",
      "The trial, expected to last four months, will put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed him to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI.",
      "Some of the victims\u2019 lawyers have said the once-respected local doctor should have been stripped of his medical privileges.",
      "Instead, Le Scouarnec, a father of three, moved on to other public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the FBI, we wouldn\u2019t have traced this back to Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec,\u201d said Francesca Satta, a lawyer for several of the victims.",
      "The trial is expected to feature hundreds of witnesses, among them Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend, both now in their 40s, who say they were assaulted in the early 1980s. Those allegations occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law.",
      "Much of the evidence against Le Scouarnec was carefully chronicled by the surgeon in digital diaries he kept on hard drives seized by investigators in the spring of 2017, after the mother of his 6-year-old neighbor reported that he\u00a0had raped the girl after luring her across a mesh fence in their gardens, prosecutors said.",
      "After his arrest, Le Scouarnec told investigators during several interrogations that he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began recording them in diaries, according to an outline of the case by the investigating judge.",
      "Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the court documents show.",
      "When investigators searched Le Scouarnec\u2019s house in May 2017, they found thousands of child pornography images as well as\u00a0 photos of the doctor performing sex acts on dolls and animals, according to a report by the investigating judge. Around\u00a05,000 videos of a \u201cviolent nature\u201d were also found, some showing acts of torture, the report said.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of raping the young neighbor and three others when they were children. He is currently serving 15 years in prison. He faces an additional 20 years if convicted of the latest charges \u2014 a sentence that lawyers say would run concurrently.",
      "The average age of the alleged 158 male and 141 female victims in the current trial is 11. The majority \u2014 256 \u2014 were under the age 15 at the time they were assaulted, most of them under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors allege.",
      "Court officials say they struggled to find venues large enough to stage the trial, which is expected to cost \u20ac3 million ($3.14 million). In the end, they decided to broadcast the trial in a former university building, around five minutes\u2019 walk from the courthouse in the center of Vannes, a Breton town with medieval ramparts, canals and a port dotted with sailboats.",
      "Victims and their families will be watching the trial on a screen in a 450-seat auditorium.",
      "The more than 450 journalists who have been accredited to cover the trial can watch a live feed in another part of the building, away from the victims. Testimony will play out in the main courthouse, with around 60 lawyers cycling through before the trial wraps up in mid-June.",
      "For many victims, that distance from their abuser was the latest blow in a process which has often made them feel sidelined, said lawyer Marie Grimaud, who is representing 37 of them.",
      "\u201cEverything is conspiring to make us invisible and to keep us at a distance, as if we were only second-rate players in this trial,\u201d reads an open letter Grimaud released on behalf of her clients.",
      "But L\u00e9v\u00eaque, who learned about her alleged rape from investigators, said she preferred to stay far away from the doctor.",
      "\u201cI feel protected.\u201d she said."

      "Darius Jeremy \u201cDJ\u201d Pierce, known by his drag persona Shangela, has been accused of sexually assaulting a crew member of a movie he was filming in 2017, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in a New York court.",
      "The complaint naming Pierce is the latest accusation against the popular \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d alum, who has denied other allegations of sexual assault, including one filed in 2023 that was settled last year.",
      "The new suit claims Pierce, 43, and an unidentified John Doe broke New York City\u2019s Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law, which gives survivors of alleged gender-motivated violence, including sexual abuse, nine years from the date of the incident to file civil claims.",
      "Andrew Brettler, a lawyer for Pierce, did not respond to a request for comment. Pierce could not be reached for comment.",
      "Plaintiff Eric Poff was an art assistant for the 2018 film \u201cHurricane Bianca: From Russia With Hate,\u201d while it filmed in New York City in the fall of 2017. Pierce was among the actors in the movie, which starred fellow \u201cDrag Race\u201d alum Bianca Del Rio.",
      "During a night out, Poff, then 28, went to a Manhattan bar with Pierce and consumed one or two drinks, according to his complaint filed with New York County Supreme Court.",
      "Poff alleges in his suit that his drink was \u201c\u2018spiked with a drug\u201d because he had \u201cno memory of events between consuming the drink and becoming semi-conscious in a hotel room.\u201d",
      "Another man was in the hotel room, along with Poff and Pierce, according to the suit. While in the room, Poff \u201cstarted to fade into consciousness\u201d and \u201cwas bent over a bed being anally penetrated without consent by John Doe with Pierce watching from the corner of the room,\u201d the complaint says. Pierce also anally penetrated Poff \u201cwithout his consent,\u201d and then later sent Poff money via PayPal, according to the suit.",
      "Poff was unavailable for a phone interview Monday, but he said in a statement to NBC News that he came forward because sexual assault remains a \u201cparticularly taboo subject\u201d in the LGBTQ community. He added that anti-sexual violence laws that allow people to pursue litigation against their accused years later are important, and New York\u2019s law gave him time to process what he says happened.",
      "\u201cI am coming forward because I have the ability and resources to do so, knowing many other victims cannot,\u201d Poff said, adding, \u201cI will not be deterred by the Defendant\u2019s popularity or potential backlash.\u201d",
      "New York City\u2019s Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law typically gives alleged victims nine years to file a claim, but in December 2022, a temporary window was open permitting claims stemming from older allegations; that window is set to close at the end of this month. The decades-old law has been cited as the basis for recent complaints filed against other high-profile defendants, including music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and luxury real estate brothers Oren and Tal Alexander.",
      "Poff\u2019s lawyer, James Vagnini, said Pierce is seeking a jury trial and damages to be determined at that time.",
      "Vagnini added that Poff\u2019s memories were \u201cfoggy\u201d since he was not fully conscious, but similar claims against Pierce that have become public in recent years compelled him to come forward.",
      "Poff continues to work in the entertainment industry, Vagnini added, and said that speaking up against a major drag performer such as Pierce, who was on multiple seasons of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d became the first drag artist on ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and has been in movies such as 2018\u2019s \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d was fraught with risk to his own career.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t let anyone off the hook because of who they are,\u201d Vagnini said. \u201cThere are people coming forward, and it shows that you can be raped no matter what your gender may be.\u201d",
      "In 2023, a former production assistant on the hit HBO show \u201cWe\u2019re Here,\u201d which features drag queens in real-life situations, filed a lawsuit accusing then-series star Pierce of raping him in a hotel room following an after-work party three years earlier.",
      "Pierce said in a statement at the time that the allegations were \u201centirely meritless,\u201d and \u201cperpetuate damaging stereotypes that are harmful not only to me but also to my entire community.\u201d",
      "That suit, filed by Daniel McGarrigle, was dismissed last year after a settlement was reached, Rolling Stone and others reported. The terms were undisclosed, and Pierce at the time did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Last March, Rolling Stone interviewed and reported on multiple people accusing Pierce of either sexually assaulting them or attempting to have sex with them when they were too inebriated to consent.",
      "In a response to Rolling Stone, Brettler, the lawyer for Pierce, called the allegations \u201cfalse and unsupported by any evidence or reliable witness testimony,\u201d and said there were \u201csignificant problems with purported accusers\u2019 accounts.\u201d He added that Pierce also \u201cadamantly denies ever engaging in nonconsensual sex.\u201d",
      "Pierce, who has 1.4 million followers on Instagram, is set to appear in the forthcoming film \u201cMagic Hour,\u201d directed and starring Katie Aselton, according to the movie\u2019s IMDB credits."

    "summary": "\u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d CBS's new daytime soap opera premiering this week, is the first all-Black daytime soap on TV.",
    "story": [
      "Black firsts in the 21st century are often surprising. \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d is no exception.",
      "The first daytime soap solely focused on a Black family premieres this week on CBS and comes as the daytime genre is disappearing. \u201cPassions,\u201d which debuted in 1999 and ended in 2008, was the last new soap opera. But it was nothing like this.",
      "Even behind the scenes, it is not lost on executive producer Sheila Ducksworth and creator Michele Val Jean that they are television pioneers.",
      "\u201cIt is 2025 and it\u2019s very true that Michele and I, from all accounts, appear to be the first two Black female executive producers doing a daytime drama,\u201d she said during a virtual news conference in January.",
      "Tamara Tunie, who plays matriarch Anita in \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d also remarked about the historic nature of this soap.",
      "\u201cThe stark difference for me is the leadership of this show and the executive producer \u2014 being Sheila Ducksworth, an African American woman \u2014 and the showrunner, executive producer, head writer, being Michele Val Jean, is the first time in history as well,\u201d Tunie said.",
      "The soap is the first fruit of CBS\u2019 partnership with the NAACP that was announced in July 2020, about two months after George Floyd was killed, to develop and produce scripted, unscripted and documentary content for both linear television and streaming.",
      "Previously, Ducksworth,\u00a0who is also the president of the CBS Studios/NAACP venture, served as co-producer of the Showtime series \u201cSoul Food.\u201d Val Jean spent her career writing for the soaps \u201cSanta Barbara,\u201d \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d and \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe and I have known each other for over 25 years, and we always said that we were going to do a soap together, and this was just an idea that I thought was right, and there was a time for it,\u201d Ducksworth told NBC News during her appearance at this year\u2019s SCAD TVfest with \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d cast members Clifton Davis, Karla Mosley and Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix. \u201cAnd fortunately, not only did CBS feel the same, but Michele felt the same, and now 200 other people that are working on it feel the same.\u201d",
      "While some may consider \u201cGenerations\u201d \u2014 which ran from 1989 to 1991 and featured Vivica A. Fox and Debbi Morgan \u2014 television\u2019s first Black soap opera, Val Jean, whose first foray into writing for the genre was on that soap, offers more clarity.",
      "\u201c\u2018Generations\u2019 had a Black family, and all due credit for that for sure, but there was still your white family,\u201d Val Jean explained. The NBC series, set in Chicago, revolved around a Black family and a white family. \u201cOur show is based around a centralized Black family. Everything comes from the Duprees.\u201d",
      "The Duprees are essentially royalty of the Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., area, who rule their gated community, Fairmont Crest. Tunie, beloved as attorney Jessica Griffin from \u201cAs the World Turns,\u201d plays a performer who met her husband during the Civil Rights Movement. Clifton Davis \u2014 perhaps best known for his leading roles in the classic comedies \u201cAmen,\u201d opposite Sherman Hemsley, and \u201cThat\u2019s My Mama\u201d \u2014 is her husband, Vernon, a civil rights activist and respected political leader.",
      "Their daughters, the spitfire Dani Dupree and dutiful Dr. Nicole Dupree Richardson, are played by \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cThe Young and the Restless\u201d alum Karla Mosley and Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix from \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d and \u201cPassions.\u201d",
      "On TV, \u201cyou have not seen this many Black people in the middle of the day,\u201d Val Jean promised.",
      "Davis said he modeled his character, Vernon, partly off congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, who died in 2020 at age 80. \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d he said, is a result of the civil rights struggle.",
      "\u201cI think we find out in our show that much of the promise has been delivered. Certainly, you can see it behind the scenes,\u201d he told NBC News at SCAD TVfest. From executives at the network, to the heads of hair and makeup, Wankaya Hinkson and Stevie Martin; to the head of production design, Bruton Jones; and, of course, Ducksworth and Val Jean, Black people are involved in all levels of decision-making for the show, he said.",
      "\u201cI think this is particularly the right time with a battle going on that\u2019s trying to remove Black history from the books and the pages of America. We\u2019re making Black history again, brand-new,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWe are living in the future with our new show.\u201d"

      "She was 88.",
      "In November 2022, a representative announced that Flack had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "The progressive disease \u201chas made it impossible to sing and not easy to speak,\u201d Flack\u2019s manager Suzanne Koga said in a news release.",
      "In a statement on Monday, representatives for Flack said they are \"heartbroken\" by her passing.",
      "\"She died peacefully surrounded by her family,\" Koga and Mikel Gilmore said in the statement. \"Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"",
      "Flack was born Feb. 10, 1937, in North Carolina. The daughter of a church organist, Flack began playing classical piano at a young age.",
      "At 15, her talents earned her a scholarship to Howard University in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jazz musician Les McCann claims he discovered Flack\u2019s talents while she was singing at Mr. Henry\u2019s, a Washington nightclub.",
      "\u201cHer voice touched, tapped, trapped and kicked every emotion I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d\u00a0McCann said. \u201cI laughed, cried and screamed for more.\u201d",
      "Eventually, McCann helped the young singer sign with Atlantic Records Group, where Flack recorded \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\u201d which was written by Ewan MacColl.",
      "The song became a breakout for Flack after it appeared on her first album, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d in 1969. After being used in Clint Eastwood\u2019s 1971 directorial debut \u201cPlay Misty for Me,\u201d however, Atlantic Records released a radio version, which became a huge hit, peaking at\u00a0No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\u00a0in 1972.",
      "In 1973, the\u00a0song won Grammys\u00a0for record and song of the year.",
      "Dozens of hits followed, including \u201cKilling Me Softly With His Song\u201d and \u201cFeel like Makin\u2019 Love\u201d \u2014 Flack\u2019s second and third No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 both of which Flack recorded with Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway.",
      "The pair recorded several songs together until Hathaway died in 1979 from a fall from a New York hotel room that was ruled a suicide.",
      "\u201cHe was very sensitive, reacting to the things around him, and whatever was inside of him. He was a genius, so he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his own performances, his own output,\u201d\u00a0Flack told The Washington Post shortly afterward.\u00a0\u201cLike many creative people, his good periods were very exuberant and his lows were extremely low.\u201d",
      "The loss hurt personally and professionally, but Flack would find a new partner, teaming up and touring with Peabo Bryson in 1980. The duo scored a hit in 1983 with \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love.\u201d She spent the remainder of the 1980s touring and performing, and returned to the Top Ten once more in 1991 with \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a duet with Maxi Priest. In 1997, Flack released an anthology of Christmas standards simply titled, \u201cChristmas Album.\u201d",
      "Flack's music was introduced to a new generation in the '90s thanks to the Fugees. With Lauryn Hill on lead vocals, their version of \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\" topped the charts around the world in 1996.",
      "In 1999, Flack received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later that year, Flack toured in South Africa, performing for then-South African President Nelson Mandela.",
      "Flack toured well into her 70s and 80s, performing for audiences around the world.",
      "In the late 2000s, Flack founded the Roberta Flack School of Music at the Hyde Leadership Charter School in the Bronx, \u201cproviding an innovative and inspiring music education program to underprivileged students free of charge.\u201d",
      "In recent years, however, Flack struggled with health issues. She had a stroke in 2016, and was hospitalized two years later when she\u00a0felt dizziness at a Jazz Foundation of America event\u00a0in which she was due to receive an award. But she returned to the stage to sing as recently as October 2018 at a party for that same charity.",
      "To the end, Flack performed the classics that had made her a star.",
      "\u201c(It\u2019s hard to) be moved, to be moved constantly by your own songs,\u201d Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cYou need it to be in tune with them, and I don\u2019t mean in tune musically, but I mean in tune with the lyrics of the songs, with the words of the songs, and with the meaning. You need to be in tune with all of that, and that takes a little bit of doing.\u201d",

      "Both DOGE and GAO have commented publicly about the need to modernize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, reform the US Postal Service,\u00a0cancel contracts for empty federal office buildings and reduce improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid, which GAO estimates costs the federal government more than $150 billion just last year.",

      "Other DOGE moves run counter to alarm bells raised by the GAO.",
      "For example, in addition to highlighting possible areas of fraud, the GAO notes\u00a0in this report, as it has before,\u00a0that the federal government is routinely leaving money on the table.",

      "One agency targeted by DOGE, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also plays a major role in disaster relief.",

      "For the podcast\u2019s Feb. 24 episode, Fishel, Rider Strong and Will Friedle brought Ward on as the show\u2019s latest guest. Ward joined the cast of \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d as Rachel McGuire in 1998 during the show\u2019s sixth season as a student who becomes a roommate to Eric Matthews (Friedle) and Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence). At the top of the episode, the former cast members spoke about how she has since become an adult film star and a model for OnlyFans.",
      "However, it was Fishel\u2019s direct question to Ward, part way into the episode, that set the tone for the rest of the conversation: \u201cDo you hate us?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Ward replied, not mincing words. \u201cThere\u2019s some beef between us. And maybe I picked up the wrong signals, but definitely, there was some sort of weirdness there.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so what did you think it was?\u201d Fishel confronted.",
      "The conversation escalated when Ward suggested that Fishel harbored jealous feelings towards her when they reunited years later for \u201cGirl Meets World,\u201d the Disney Channel sequel to \u201cBoy Meets World.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the fact that I was getting a lot of attention at that time and going off in my own space and taking away, like that attention,\u201d Ward replied, a claim Fishel swiftly shut down.",
      "\u201cI was on the cover of Maxim in 2014,\u201d she countered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in any way upset.\u201d",
      "While talking over one another, the two actors hashed out lingering grievances, including Ward\u2019s claim that Fishel had unfriended her on Facebook and Fishel\u2019s accusation that Ward was seeking attention on the podcast. The more they dug in, the more the unease grew, with Fishel accusing Ward of speaking regularly and critically to TMZ about the podcast.",
      "\u201cIt seems like almost any time the podcast is in the news, in the press, there\u2019s a quickly followed-up TMZ interview with you,\u201d Fishel replied. \u201cHow do those happen, by the way?\u201d",
      "\u201cThey come and get me; they find me on the streets,\u201d Ward replied. \u201cAre you trying to accuse me of something?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was just curious because it seems as though every time we\u2019ve been in the news, shortly thereafter, there\u2019s an interview with you on TMZ,\u201d Fishel replied.",
      "When Fishel continued asking about her TMZ interviews, Ward replied, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this is like a grilling session right now?\u201d",
      "More friction arose when Ward addressed the group, saying, \u201cI think there\u2019s a divide too because you guys hate Ben (Savage), and you guys hate (\u2018Boy Meets World\u2019 creator) Michael (Jacobs).\u201d",
      "\u201cBen is one of the most important people I\u2019ve ever met in my life, and I can\u2019t stand the fact that he won\u2019t speak to us,\u201d Friedle cut in, later adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it is: He won\u2019t speak to us.\u201d",
      "When Ward accused Fishel of inviting her on the show for rating, Fishel, in turn, replied, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who wanted to go after ratings.\u201d",
      "At one point, Ward's connection was lost and exited the interview. A producer asked Friedle to text her and make sure it wasn't intentional and shortly after, Ward logged back on.",
      "By the end, the podcasters and Ward wrapped up with a friendly to tepid farewell, with the hosts suggesting that Ward join them again.",
      "\u201cThank you for joining us, Maitland,\u201d Fishel said. \u201cIt was nice to talk to you. Share some good times, share not-so-good times.\u201d",
      "Ward signed off, replying, \u201cThanks.\u201d",
      "Still, when Ward was gone, and only the three hosts remained for a\u00a0recap, Friedle replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like when things are tense.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know,\u201d Fishel replied, before saying again that Ward was using the conflict as an opportunity for publicity.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hate Maitland, not even the slightest,\u201d she concluded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have her back (on the podcast). Does that mean that Maitland and I need to have each other\u2019s numbers and send each other texts? Absolutely not. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t need that, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d she said of receiving the honor. \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t always been so popular in this town and so getting this award means a lot.\u201d",
      "Jane Fonda's full speech at 2025 SAG Awards",
      "\"This means the world to me. What about the sound system? I'm going to talk loud. This means the world to me! You can't know. Thank you SAG-AFTRA. Thank you. Wow.",
      "And your enthusiasm makes it seem, I don't know, less like a late twilight of my life and more like a 'Go girl, kick ass.' Which is good, because I'm not done.",
      "You know, I have had a really weird career. Totally not \u2014 as my agents there at that table will testify \u2014 totally un-strategic. I retired for 15 years, and then I came back at 65, which is not usual. And I made one of my most successful movies in my 80s. And probably in my 90s, I'll be doing my own stunts and an action movie.",
      "Have you ever heard the phrase, how does it go, 'It's OK to be a late bloomer as long as you don't miss the flower show.' I'm a late bloomer. This is the flower show (puts hand on her award).",
      "I love acting. We get to open people's minds to new ideas, take them beyond what they understand of the world and help them laugh when things are tough. Like now. And for a woman like me who grew up in the '40s and '50s when women weren't supposed to have opinions and not get angry, acting gave me a chance to play angry women with opinions. Which as you know, is a bit of a stretch for me.",
      "I'm a big believer in unions. They have our backs. They bring us into community, and they give us power. Community means power. And this is really important right now, when workers' power ... workers' power is being attacked, and community is being weakened. Yes. But SAG-AFTRA is different than most other unions because us, the workers, we actors, we don't manufacture anything tangible.",
      "What we create is empathy. Our job is to understand another human being so profoundly that we can touch their souls. We know why they do what they do. We feel their joys and their pain. (Pre-recorded announcer is briefly heard) And I can conjure up voices.",
      "We have to drill deep, don't we? We have to know, for example, if a young woman is cutting, or she's a sex worker, there's a good chance that as a young girl she was sexually abused or incested. I'm thinking Bree Daniels in \"Klute.\" And I'm sure many of you guys have played bullies and misogynists, and you can pretty much know, you actors, right, that probably their father bullied them and called men that he felt were weak, he called them losers or pussies.",
      "And while you may hate the behavior of your character, you have to understand and empathize with the traumatized person you're playing, right? Thinking Sebastian Stan in \"The Apprentice.\"",
      "Make no mistake, empathy is not weak or woke. And by the way, woke just means you give a damn about other people. Back to empathy. A whole lot of people are going to be really hurt by what is happening, what is coming our way. And even if they're of a different political persuasion, we need to call upon our empathy and not judge, but listen from our hearts and welcome them into our tent, because we are going to need a big tent to resist successfully what's coming at us.",
      "I made my first movie in 1958. It was the tail end of McCarthyism, when so many careers were destroyed. Today it's helpful to remember, though, that Hollywood resisted. We did. Overseas, brave American producers like Hannah Weinstein hired blacklisted writers. Myrna Loy, John Huston and Billy Wilder founded the Committee for the First Amendment.",
      "They had a radio show on ABC radio called 'Hollywood Fights Back.' Members of the committee included every big-name actor in town.",
      "Have any of you ever watched a documentary of one of the great social movements, like apartheid or our civil rights movement or Stonewall, and asked yourself, would you have been brave enough to walk the bridge? Would you have been able to take the hoses and the batons and the dogs?",
      "We don't have to wonder anymore because we are in our documentary moment. This is it. And it's not a rehearsal.",
      "This is it. And we mustn't for a moment kid ourselves about what's happening. This is big-time serious, folks. So let's be brave. This is a good time for a little Norma Rae or Karen Silkwood or Tom Joad. We must not isolate. We must stay in community. We must help the vulnerable. We must find ways to project an inspiring vision of the future. One that is beckoning, welcoming, that will help people believe that, to quote the novelist Pearl Cleage, 'on the other side of the conflagration, there will still be love. There will still be beauty. And there will be an ocean of truth for us to swim in.' Let's make it so.",
      "Thank you for this encouragement. Thank you.\""

      "\"I\u00a0think it\u2019s always a risk. You\u2019re taking a risk because I made a lot of bad decisions and messed up the first festival. Until it\u2019s experienced, there is a risk component to it,\" he said.",
      "McFarland told Sellers in September that he and organizers have \u201cthe chance to embrace the storm\u201d when it comes to pitching to artists for the new event.",
      "\u201cSince 2016 Fyre has been the most talked about music festival in the world,\u201d he explained. \u201cObviously, a lot of that has been negative, but I think that most people, once they kind of get under the hood and study the plans and see the team behind Fyre II, they see the upside... And if it\u2019s done well, I think Fyre has a chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what McFarland has said so far about Fyre Festival 2.",
      "When is Fyre Festival 2?",
      "Eight years after the original Fyre Festival in 2017, Fyre Festival 2 is was bumped back a month and is now slated to run from May 30 to June 2.",
      "\"We just needed the extra month to give our partners time to get everything ready,\" McFarland said.",
      "Where will Fyre Festival 2 be held?",
      "While the original festival was based on the island Great Exuma in the Bahamas, McFarland said that the new festival would take place in Isla Mujeres.",
      "McFarland said that an \u201cincredible production company\u201d is in place and will be \u201chandling everything from soup to nuts.\u201d",
      "In his 2024 interview, he didn\u2019t confirm the name of the island but said that the festival would use existing infrastructure for eateries, lodging and restrooms.",
      "All logistics would be handled by the production company, with McFarland adding, \u201cBut we are developing and building out the private island for the actual festival festivities.\u201d",
      "How to get Fyre Fest II tickets",
      "A total of 2,000 tickets will go on sale beginning Feb. 24. They range in price from $1,400 to $1.1 million. McFarland says customers can get yacht accommodations and access to artists who will be performing.",
      "Ticket information can be found on a dedicated Fyre Fest 2 website here.",
      "McFarland previously shared that he had already sold 100 tickets at $500 each. He also said that other packages would be on sale, ranging in price from $1,400 to $1.1 million.",
      "For that million dollar price package, McFarland said, \u201cYou will be on a boat, have the luxury yachts that we partner with who will be docked and parked outside the island.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut once again, Fyre is not just about this, like, luxury experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the adventure. So you\u2019ll be scuba diving with me. You\u2019ll be bouncing around to other islands and other countries on small planes.\u201d",
      "What happened at the original Fyre Fest?",
      "While Fyre Festival was marketed as a luxury, \u201conce-in-a-lifetime musical experience\u201d on a private island, what attendees got was a far cry from what they had been promised.",
      "NBC News reported that festival goers, with some paying $250,000 for premium tickets, were met with less-than-ideal circumstances, including boxed meals such as the infamous cheese sandwiches, inadequate security and low-grade sleeping tents.",
      "Many of the headlining acts, including Blink-182, canceled their appearances at the festival before the weekend even kicked off.",
      "Fyre Festival was ultimately postponed due to \u201cunforeseen and extenuating circumstances,\u201d with McFarland telling Rolling Stone, \u201cWe were a little na\u00efve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves.\u201d",
      "In March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges tied to the festival, NBC News reported. Months later in July, he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges from a separate incident after he made $150,000 in fake ticket sales to different events. McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison on fraud charges in October 2018.",
      "A minimum of $500,000 from the festival will go toward the $26 million in restitution McFarland still owes. He and all his partners have also committed to 10 percent of total profits going toward that, as well. They also expect to sell out within a day, based on interest they have seen on their site.",
      "McFarland was released from prison in May 2022, more than two years before the end of his sentence, after earning good time credit, his lawyer, Jason Russo, told NBC News at the time."

      "During the ceremony, members of the Wayans family came up on stage to accept the award, including Kim Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr. and his son Damon Wayans Jr. For a majority of the speech, Marlon and Damon Wayans Sr. spoke and reflected on their humble beginnings in the projects of New York.

Damon Wayans Sr. revealed in this 2025 NAACP Image Award acceptance speech that Keenen Ivory Wayans locked himself in his bedroom for two weeks while he came up with the idea for the film.",

Keenan won an Emmy in 1990 for outstanding variety, music or comedy series (shared with Kevin Bright, Tamara Rawitt and Michael Petok) the year the show debuted.

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 11:31:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump said that Russian President Putin \"has no problem with,\" peacekeepers in Ukraine, but the Kremlin contradicted those comments Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 President Donald Trump was incorrect when he said that Russia will accept European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, the Kremlin signaled Tuesday.",
      "While Trump said Monday during a White House meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron that he had \"specifically asked\" Russian President Vladimir Putin about peacekeepers and that Putin \"has no problem with it,\" the Kremlin contradicted those comments early Tuesday.",
      "When asked about Trump's remarks in a media call, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"the Russian foreign minister has already said everything about it, I've got nothing to add.\"",
      "Peskov was referring to comments Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made last week in a news conference following talks in Saudi Arabia with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Lavrov said that \u201cthe deployment of troops ... [from] NATO countries, but under a foreign flag, under the flag of the European Union or under national flags ... is, of course, unacceptable to us.\u201d",
      "Moscow's denial of Trump's claim that Putin would accept European peacekeeping troops is the latest twist in relations between the Trump administration, America's historical European allies and Putin \u2014 who until a recent and rapid warming in relations with Washington had been viewed as a global pariah.",
      "That rapprochement between America and Russia has coincided \u2014 and been a cause of \u2014 the splintering of Washington's relationship with Europe and the sidelining of Ukraine and its continental allies from so-far bilateral peace talks between the two superpowers.",
      "While Trump and Macron renewed their friendly rapport, their Oval Office meeting was emblematic of the transatlantic rift emerging over Ukraine and a host of other issues, including tariffs, as the French president became the first European leader to visit the White House since Trump began his second term.",
      "On the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Macron warned Trump to be \u201ccareful\u201d in his negotiations with Putin. The two also appeared to disagree over who was to blame for the war, as well as Europe's financial contributions to Ukraine.",
      "After Trump said that Europe, unlike the U.S., would get back the money it had given Ukraine in military aid, Macron said \u201cNo, in fact, to be frank, we paid 60% of the total,\u201d adding that \u201cit was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantees, grants, and we provided real money, to be clear.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you believe that, it\u2019s OK with me,\u201d Trump replied, later saying that the U.S. and Ukraine were \u201cvery close to a final deal\u201d for his administration to access Ukraine's rare-earth metals deposits as a way to recoup some aid, even after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week rejected a U.S. demand for $500 billion in minerals.",
      "Back in Ukraine, Zelenskyy's troops were similarly circumspect about the prospect of a rare-earth and precious metals deal heavily weighted toward the Trump administration clawing back some of the funds that the U.S. has given to Ukraine since Russian troops invaded.",
      "At first, the money \u201cwas announced as a humanitarian aid,\u201d  Valentyn, an ex-pastry chef and now a tank commander in the Ukrainian military, told NBC News on Monday. \u201cBut after Trump became a president, he has started to set his conditions, which we don\u2019t accept.\u201d",
      "\"I\u2019d [like] to talk about Trump \u2014 it\u2019s politics. If we pay attention to everything, it\u2019s easy to give up. If we give up, we lose all our borders,\" added Valentyn, who asked that only his first name or call sign be used in accordance with military protocol.",
      "Macron responded to Trump's comments about peacekeepers later Monday in an interview with Fox News, saying that \u201cwe want peace. And I think the initiative of President Trump is a very positive one. But my message was to say be careful because we need something substantial for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Lavrov and Rubio were expected to meet again in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this week to enter negotiations over Ukraine \u2014 again without Kyiv's presence.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Kiev will be invited to the negotiating table in due time,\u201d Russia\u2019s permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said Monday, according to the Russian state news agency Tass.",
      "The latest evidence of the fracturing in relations between Europe and the U.S., Trump\u2019s meeting with Macron came shortly after the U.S. opposed a United Nations resolution by Ukraine calling for Russia\u2019s withdrawal from internationally recognized borders.",
      "The U.S. instead brought its own resolution, from which it ended up abstaining after European nations won three amendments to it.",
      "Before his spokesperson dismissed the idea of European boots on the ground in Ukraine, Putin told a state media reporter Monday that \"we would only welcome\" Europe\u2019s involvement in negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, all of Ukraine was under air raid alerts early Tuesday after the country's air force warned of Russian missile attacks, which prompted scrambling of Polish aircraft and of other allies over Polish airspace.",
      "\u201cThe war is shifting from the ground operations to the air battles,\u201d Valentyn said.",
      "Richard Engel reported from Kyiv, Ukraine and Mithil Aggarwal reported from London."

      "Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 when Israeli forces bombed a building in southern Beirut where he was meeting with Hezbollah commanders.

      "Nasrallah became its leader in 1992, marking a transformative era for Hezbollah in which it expanded its military capabilities and political influence in Lebanon. Under his guidance, Hezbollah fought the 2006 war with Israel, as rockets rained down on northern Israel while Israeli airstrikes ravaged southern Lebanon for 34 days.",
      "His influence soared during the conflict, where he was widely regarded as a symbol of defiance across the Arab world. Hezbollah\u2019s extensive media apparatus amplified his charisma, making him an influential figure beyond Lebanon\u2019s borders.",
      "He also forged deep alliances with Iran and Syria, with Iran providing critical financial, military and political support that helped Hezbollah become a major regional force.",
      "However, his decision to send fighters to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad in the country\u2019s civil war marked a turning point. Once seen as the leader of resistance, he became increasingly viewed as an agent of Iran\u2019s regional ambitions.",
      "Accusations of Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri further eroded his standing in parts of the Arab world.",
      "As Israel launched its ground invasion in southern Lebanon and bombarded its capital from the skies, Nasrallah\u2019s death delivered a major blow early in Israel\u2019s offensive, significantly weakening the Iran-backed group while raising questions about its future.",
      "To his supporters, he remained a steadfast defender of Shia Muslims and Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. To his critics, he was a divisive figure, aligning Hezbollah\u2019s trajectory with Tehran at the expense of national unity.",

      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, but prosecutors said he has admitted to many, but not all, of the charges. Unlike in the United States, defendants in France are brought to trial even if they admit guilt.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates hope the trial, set to last four months, will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d said Francesca Satta, who is representing 10 victims and families. \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pedophile fantasies\u2019",
      "Beyond the medical world, the lines have often blurred in France over what constitutes child abuse versus seduction.\u00a0The once-celebrated writer Gabriel Matzneff, now 88, made having sex with adolescents a staple of his books, even boasting about the practice in an infamous TV interview, until a leading literary publisher, Vanessa Springora, called him out in her own 2020 book for grooming her for sex in the 1980s when she was 14 and he was 50.",
      "It is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged. Earlier this month, in a closely watched case seen as a test of evolving attitudes toward sex with minors, the director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually assaulting actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, now 35, from the time he cast her in a film when she was 12 and he was 36. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, with two years suspended.",
      "\u201cL\u2019Affaire Scouarnec\u201d has drawn parallels with another high-profile trial that transfixed the country late last year and led to the conviction of Dominique Pelicot, 72, for organizing and documenting the mass rape of his sleeping wife, whom he drugged, by dozens of men over a decade. He is now under investigation for two other alleged crimes involving drugging: the rape and murder of a young woman in 1991 and the attempted rape of another in 1999.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, investigators discovered a trove of allegedly incriminating evidence on hard drives seized in the suspect\u2019s house, including thousands of photos depicting child sexual abuse and videos, many of them violent, French media reported.",
      "Le Scouarnec allegedly told investigators he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began keeping a diary, according to court documents. Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the\u00a0documents show.",
      "The assaults tracked in the digital diaries stop in March 2017, when Le Scouarnec was arrested on charges of raping his 6-year-old neighbor after luring her across a gap in the mesh fence between their gardens, according to testimony. In December 2020, he was convicted in that case, along with the rape and sexual assault of two of his nieces when they were children in the 1980s and \u201990s, and a 4-year-old patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the 15 years he is now serving in connection with the 2020 conviction. With his pretrial detention and parole eligibility taken into account, he could be out by 2030, said lawyer Marie Grimaud.",
      "Grimaud, who is representing 37 victims, and other lawyers say the penalties for sex crimes and child abuse should be much more severe.",
      "\u201cIn France, if you rape one person, you rape 300, it\u2019s exactly the same number of years you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "Warning signs",
      "The first people who knew about Le Scouarnec\u2019s behavior were his family. As early as 1984, references to the rapes of a niece and a family friend appear in the surgeon\u2019s diaries, according to court documents. But none of the adults took action, even after the children told them, and the abuse continued, three family members told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is a man who sees children as sexual objects,\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece Alexandra, 47, told NBC News. She said her uncle isolated her and then raped her from ages 5 to 13. (NBC News does not name victims\u00a0of sexual assault, but Alexandra has asked that her first name be used.)",
      "She said she will testify at the upcoming trial, along with a family friend who was also one of the first victims mentioned in the diaries, though Le Scouarnec cannot be charged in their cases because the acts happened too long ago under French law.",
      "Some children knew Le Scouarnec\u2019s \u201cexam\u201d was not appropriate, but their parents brushed aside their complaints, said Hugo Lemonier, a journalist who spent three years researching a new book about the case, \u201cTrapped: In the Intimate Diaries of Dr. Le Scouarnec.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we see in this case is the omnipotence of the medical profession,\u201d he said.",
      "French authorities were first alerted in January 2004, when the FBI told them Le Scouarnec\u2019s credit card was linked to a pedophile website the agency was monitoring, court records show. There is no indication that medical authorities were notified as the police carried out their investigation.",
      "At his trial for possession of child sexual abuse material in the fall of 2005, the surgeon was \u201calmost considered a victim,\u201d Lemonier said. Le Scouarnec presented himself as a man \u201cin a moment of great distress,\u201d recounting how his wife had left him, taking their three kids, and in his solitude he \u201cfound a refuge, an escape\u201d in viewing the material, he added.",
      "The surgeon, who specialized in appendectomies and abdominal and gynecological surgery, got a break when the judge imposed a four-month suspended sentence with no restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe judge could have ordered him to stop practicing or seek treatment, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Homayra Sellier, founder of the child protection agency Innocence in Danger. \u201cHe should have lost his medical license.\u201d",
      "Another opportunity was missed in June 2006, when a psychiatrist at the hospital where Le Scouarnec worked in Quimperl\u00e9, on the southern coast of Brittany, learned about his conviction and wrote a letter alerting the hospital director, who passed it along to the local medical board and ordered the surgeon to be accompanied whenever he was with minors, according to France Info.",
      "\u2018A nutcase in Brittany\u2019",
      "The local medical board requested a copy of the conviction, but it took the prosecutor\u2019s office five months to send it, which was then forwarded to state authorities, Lemonier said. \u201cAfter that, they washed their hands of it.\u201d",
      "Back at the hospital, the order requiring the surgeon to be shadowed was never carried out, and Le Scouarnec, whose modus operandi was to isolate victims under the guise of examining them, would go on to abuse at least 54 more victims from 2004 to 2017, all of whom are part of the current case, Lemonier said.",
      "Not all of the victims in the diaries have been pursued by investigators, he said, adding that according to his count the total could top 400.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chain of failures where nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d Lemonier said. \u201cThe police, the courts, the medical association, the hospitals, the health authorities and the state are all responsible.\u201d",
      "The hospital director, Andr\u00e9 Labat, died in 2013. The current administration declined to comment when contacted by NBC News, as did all of the boards that could have imposed sanctions or revoked Le Scouarnec\u2019s medical license, including the local and regional medical boards and the regional health agency. The national Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The local branch of the national police referred questions to the national police press office, which also did not respond.",
      "\u201cThe French authorities were warned that we had a nutcase in Brittany,\u201d said lawyer Maud Touitou, who represents eight victims. She called local oversight boards \u201cbarons\u201d that \u201crevel in their provincial social status, who have no other goal but to continue to have and exercise their little power.\u201d",
      "In June 2008, Le Scouarnec moved to a hospital in Jonzac, about five hours\u2019 drive south, where he was considered the \u201cwise man\u201d on staff, Le Monde reported. The hospital\u2019s former director, Mich\u00e8le Cals, told police in 2017 that she didn\u2019t take \u201cany special measures\u201d when the surgeon told her about his conviction because there had been \u201cno physical aggression,\u201d according to Radio France, which counted more than 20 victims at the Jonzac hospital. Cals could not be reached for comment, and the Jonzac hospital declined to comment.",
      "\u200b\u200bChildren\u2019s advocates are hoping the trial will prompt sweeping changes beyond tougher laws. They are hoping that the accounts of victims will be given greater credence.",
      "For the victims, who have waited nearly eight years since the investigation began to tell their stories \u2014 some have waited decades \u2014 the trial represents a chance to heal.",
      "\u201cThe only fear they have is that the entire trial will focus on Le Scouarnec,\u201d Grimaud said.",
      "\u201cThey want to be recognized.\u201d",
      "Linda Hervieux reported from Paris, and Gabrielle Nolin from London.",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org.

      "The four adult children of Peter and Barbie Reynolds said their parents have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, remaining after the Taliban toppled the Western-backed government in 2021.",
      "The couple run Afghanistan-based Rebuild, an organization that provides education and training programs for businesses, government agencies, educational organizations and nongovernmental groups.

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A fleet of Chinese fishing vessels used North Korean crews from 2019 to 2024 in violation of U.N. bans, and many people were apparently subjected to abuses including being trapped at sea for years, a report said Monday.",
      "The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-based group specializing in environmental and human rights issues, said it identified the presence of North Koreans on 12 Chinese tuna long-liners operating in the southwest Indian Ocean. The report was based mostly on interviews with 19 Indonesians and Filipinos who worked alongside them.",
      "\u201cThe testimony received from Indonesian and Filipino crew members suggests that concerted efforts were made to hide the presence of North Koreans on these vessels, and that those North Koreans on board were forced to work for as many as 10 years at sea \u2014 in some instances without ever stepping foot on land,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThis would constitute forced labor of a magnitude that surpasses much of that witnessed in a global fishing industry already replete with abuse,\u201d it added.",
      "The group said the North Koreans were passed from vessel to vessel to prevent them from returning to land. It cited unidentified Asian crew members as saying their North Korean shipmates were not allowed to use mobile phones or leave vessels during port visits.",
      "The group said it was unable to estimate the number of North Koreans aboard the Chinese vessels because of the transfers.",
      "The use of North Korean crew would be a breach of 2017 U.N. Security Council resolutions that required member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans and to repatriate all remaining North Korean workers from their territories by the end of 2019.",
      "The sanctions were adopted after North Korea conducted nuclear and long-range missile tests in violation of earlier council resolutions.",
      "The group said the use of North Korean crews also appears to have bypassed legal frameworks in Britain and the European Union designed to prevent goods produced by North Koreans from entering their supply chains. The EJF said that it also found ships that were suspected of collecting fish from the Chinese vessels had entered key markets in Asia including Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.",
      "Along with Russia, China is suspected of not fully enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and has vetoed U.S.-led efforts to toughen U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its banned weapons tests.",
      "Asked about the EJF report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a briefing Monday that he was not not familiar with it but said China carries out offshore fishing in accordance with laws and regulations.",
      "Lin said China\u2019s relevant cooperation with North Korea is also conducted \u201cwithin the framework of international law.\u201d",
      "The EJF said it was the first time North Korean labor had been publicly documented on a distant-water fishing vessel.",
      "Before the 2019 U.N. deadline, tens of thousands of North Koreans were reported to be working abroad, mostly at factories and restaurants in China and logging camps and construction sites in Russia, to bring in much-needed foreign currency.",
      "North Korean workers abroad were in general under the constant surveillance of their country\u2019s security agents, toiled more than 12 hours a day and took home a fraction of their salaries, with the rest going to their government, according to defectors and experts.",
      "Despite the U.N. ban, South Korean officials and experts believe a large number of North Korean workers remain engaged in economic activities around the world and transmit money that is used in the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programs."

      "VANNES, France \u2014\u00a0A retired surgeon accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 people admitted in court that he committed \u201chideous\u201d acts, as France\u2019s largest ever child sexual abuse case got underway on Monday.",
      "\u201cIf I am appearing before you it\u2019s because one day, when most of these people were just children, I committed hideous acts,\u201d Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec said in a sober voice after Judge Aude Buresi, the president of a five-judge panel hearing the case, asked if he had a statement to make.",
      "Le Scouarnec, who was wearing a black coat and glasses, added that he was prepared to take responsibility for his actions \u201cand the consequences they may have had and may have for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how many victims the 74-year-old was referring to in his brief statement at the Palais de Justice in Vannes, a small town in Brittany, northwestern France.",
      "Defense lawyer Maxime Tessier told reporters outside court that Le Scouarnec, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence for the abuse of four other children, has admitted to the \u201cvast majority,\u201d of the charges but not all of them.",
      "Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, 42, who has accused the surgeon of raping her when she was just 9 years old and under anesthesia, is expected to testify against him during the trial, told NBC News she \u201cdidn\u2019t think much\u201d of Le Scouarnec\u2019s words.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really believe he is sincere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s good that they made him give this little speech. We\u2019ve always said he was silent.\u201d",
      "Sol\u00e8ne Podevin, the president of the Confronting Incest Association, also pointed out that he had acknowledges responsibility, \u201cbut not necessarily for all the acts.\u201d",
      "The trial, expected to last four months, will put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed him to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI.",
      "Some of the victims\u2019 lawyers have said the once-respected local doctor should have been stripped of his medical privileges.",
      "Instead, Le Scouarnec, a father of three, moved on to other public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the FBI, we wouldn\u2019t have traced this back to Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec,\u201d said Francesca Satta, a lawyer for several of the victims.",
      "The trial is expected to feature hundreds of witnesses, among them Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend, both now in their 40s, who say they were assaulted in the early 1980s. Those allegations occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law.",
      "Much of the evidence against Le Scouarnec was carefully chronicled by the surgeon in digital diaries he kept on hard drives seized by investigators in the spring of 2017, after the mother of his 6-year-old neighbor reported that he\u00a0had raped the girl after luring her across a mesh fence in their gardens, prosecutors said.",
      "After his arrest, Le Scouarnec told investigators during several interrogations that he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began recording them in diaries, according to an outline of the case by the investigating judge.",
      "Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the court documents show.",
      "When investigators searched Le Scouarnec\u2019s house in May 2017, they found thousands of child pornography images as well as\u00a0 photos of the doctor performing sex acts on dolls and animals, according to a report by the investigating judge. Around\u00a05,000 videos of a \u201cviolent nature\u201d were also found, some showing acts of torture, the report said.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of raping the young neighbor and three others when they were children. He is currently serving 15 years in prison. He faces an additional 20 years if convicted of the latest charges \u2014 a sentence that lawyers say would run concurrently.",
      "The average age of the alleged 158 male and 141 female victims in the current trial is 11. The majority \u2014 256 \u2014 were under the age 15 at the time they were assaulted, most of them under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors allege.",
      "Court officials say they struggled to find venues large enough to stage the trial, which is expected to cost \u20ac3 million ($3.14 million). In the end, they decided to broadcast the trial in a former university building, around five minutes\u2019 walk from the courthouse in the center of Vannes, a Breton town with medieval ramparts, canals and a port dotted with sailboats.",
      "Victims and their families will be watching the trial on a screen in a 450-seat auditorium.",
      "The more than 450 journalists who have been accredited to cover the trial can watch a live feed in another part of the building, away from the victims. Testimony will play out in the main courthouse, with around 60 lawyers cycling through before the trial wraps up in mid-June.",
      "For many victims, that distance from their abuser was the latest blow in a process which has often made them feel sidelined, said lawyer Marie Grimaud, who is representing 37 of them.",
      "\u201cEverything is conspiring to make us invisible and to keep us at a distance, as if we were only second-rate players in this trial,\u201d reads an open letter Grimaud released on behalf of her clients.",
      "But L\u00e9v\u00eaque, who learned about her alleged rape from investigators, said she preferred to stay far away from the doctor.",
      "\u201cI feel protected.\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.",
      "The inscription begins with the word \u201cI\u201d in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word \u201crune,\u201d researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.",
      "\u201cBasically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber\u2019s name, wrote the runic inscription,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,\u201d added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo\u2019s Museum of Cultural History.",
      "The researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.",
      "Runic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.",
      "Often they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.",
      "But very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.",
      "The latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language\u2019s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.",
      "Two years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.",
      "\u201cThey managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,\u201d Zilmer said.",
      "Due to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a \u201cbit tricky,\u201d but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a \u201c-u.\u201d",
      "In ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman\u2019s name which, if confirmed, \u201cwould be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.\u201d",
      "Because the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.",
      "\u201cWe may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,\u201d Zilmer said. \u201cIt may be a stone that combines different purposes.\u201d",
      "While much of the research is still ongoing, \u201cwe are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,\u201d she added."
