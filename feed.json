      "Billy Joel\u2019s beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes",
      "Billy Joel's beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes.",
      "The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri.",
      "In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The 76-year-old singer, composer and pianist was having trouble with his balance but otherwise felt good, he said in an interview last month on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast.",
      "Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically promoting an aesthetic here,\" he said in a 2013 YouTube video filmed at the shop. \"I like older style. I like the automotive style from the \u201830s to the \u201960s. I wanted to collect a whole bunch of those kinds of bikes, put \u2019em in one place and let people see what that era of bike looked like. Because it\u2019s starting to be a lost aesthetic.\u201d",
      "He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay \u2014 a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan \u2014 where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been living in this community for a long time,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI actually grew up not far from here. And I\u2019d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.\u201d",

      "Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island.",
      "The shop became a popular stop for motorcycle enthusiasts and tourists. It was home to Joel's collection of more than 75 bikes, dating back all the way to the 1940s and including Harley-Davidsons, Triumphs, Ducatis, Moto Guzzis, Indians and BMWs. One of the most valuable, he said, was a 1952 Vincent Rapide, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars and sometimes more, according to auction sites.",
      "\u201cI think everybody in Oyster Bay would agree that it\u2019s a big loss,\" said Ted Bahr, who owns a vintage rock poster gallery next to 20th Century Cycles. \u201cBilly\u2019s place is visited on weekends by dozens and dozens of people, typically on motorcycles but also people in cars,. People come up and look at the window all the time. I mean it\u2019s a real destination. Billy Joel is a real superstar, and he is a hometown boy, so it\u2019s really unfortunate.\"",
      "The motorcycles that were in the shop have already been moved out. But it has been open on recent weekends selling new, used and vintage motorcycle parts that were still in stock there.",
      "Joel's enthusiasm for motorcycles dates back decades. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist. He spent about a month in the hospital. He has also ridden motorcycles in various benefits for 9/11 first responders, breast cancer and other causes over the years.",
      "A date for the auction of his collection has not been set.",

      "NEW YORK -- When the musical \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d said goodbye to Broadway a decade ago, there were tears and hugs and tons of applause. In the audience of its last show, one woman wasn't entirely buying it.",
      "\u201cI felt then that it wasn\u2019t goodbye forever. I felt we\u2019d be back one day,\u201d says producer Judy Craymer, who had conceived of the show in the 1980s. \u201cI always hoped.\u201d",
      "That one day has become today as the ABBA-fueled, feel-good musical returns to its first home on Broadway, the Winter Garden Theatre. It reopens Thursday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to visit the old place where you went to high school,\u201d says Victor Wallace, who made his Broadway debut in the show in 2012, stayed to the final curtain in 2015 and has returned. \u201cThere's so many backstage stories and people and I\u2019m a little overwhelmed.\u201d",
      "Fans have fueled the return of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d to make it among the top earners on Broadway, last week grossing $1.57 million over seven previews, fourth behind only \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d",
      "\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d endured plenty during its first Broadway life \u2014 wars, hurricanes, the 2008 financial meltdown, the move to a smaller theater and critics, who never warmed to the show\u2019s high-energy sweetness.",
      "A hit in London \u2014 where it is still playing \u2014 \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d opened in New York just a few weeks after the 2001 terror attacks when there was deep gloom and anxiety.",
      "Christine Sherrill, who recently toured as the show's mom and is now making her Broadway debut in the role, says audiences are responding to another time of stress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a time of peril again, where communities are divided. So to be able to go into some of these cities and have 3,000 people \u2014 who would never find themselves enjoying the same thing outside of the theater \u2014 sitting there all enjoying this communal experience is really interesting.\u201d",
      "The show, featuring more than 20 classic ABBA hits, including \u201cDancing Queen\u201d and \u201cWaterloo,\u201d has been a smash in dozens of countries, including South Korea, Italy, Denmark, South Africa and Spain.",
      "Craymer sees the data about the new flock of theatergoers and notes this \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is popular with groups. \u201cThere were people that had seen it on Broadway \u2014 probably when they were younger \u2014 and now coming back in their 20s and 30s and then bringing their daughters or family.\u201d",

      "The musical prompted Craymer to produce a movie version starring Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, that became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2008. A sequel, \u201cMamma Mia! Here We Go Again,\u201d came out a decade later. ABBA\u2019s music continues to be the backdrop for numerous popular TikTok trends.",

      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber said Wednesday he could sentence Weinstein on Sept. 30 \u2014 but only if there\u2019s no retrial on a rape charge that the last jury failed to reach a verdict on.",
      "Weinstein, 73, was convicted in June of forcing oral sex on TV and movie production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006. The charge carries a possible sentence of up to 25 years in prison.",
      "At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn\u2019t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors told Farber that they\u2019re ready to take Weinstein to trial for a third time on the rape charge, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. That\u2019s less time than Weinstein has already served.",
      "Mann is on board to testify again, they said.",
      "Prosecutors requested a January trial date, citing witness availability and their own caseload. Farber balked at that, saying a January date is too far away and conflicts with another, unrelated trial he\u2019s already scheduled. He proposed having the trial in the fall.",
      "\u201cThe case needs to be tried this year,\u201d Farber said.",
      "Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala agreed, telling Farber he\u2019d prefer a trial at \u201cthe earliest the court can accommodate us.\u201d",
      "Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said she would ask Mann and other witnesses about their availability for a trial in the fall.",

The \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d producer is committed to fighting the rape charge at another trial, Aidala said, though the lawyer didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of reaching a deal with prosecutors to end the case.",
      "For now, the trial date remains unresolved, leaving Weinstein\u2019s possible Sept. 30 sentencing in limbo.",
      "At Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, jurors convicted him of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on production assistant and producer Miriam Haley.",

      "In a month that\u2019s long been known to let edgier movies thrive, Zach Cregger\u2019s highly anticipated horror film \u201cWeapons\u201d did not disappoint, topping the box office during its debut weekend with $42.5 million domestically from 3,202 theaters. It made $70 million internationally.",
      "The film\u2019s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio\u2019s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Disney\u2019s chaotic sequel to the 2003 classic, \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d took the second spot during its premiere weekend, earning $29 million in 3,975 North American theaters. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis return, this time for a double body-swapping between the mother-daughter duo and Lohan\u2019s teen daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter.",
      "Viral marketing tactics, coupled with strong social media word-of-mouth, boded well for both films\u2019 success, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cThe top two films could not be more different, and that\u2019s what makes this weekend so appealing for moviegoers,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBoth are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The town is left to navigate the lingering effects of trauma through horror, paranoia and a touch of existential humor.",
      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d generated a lot of buzz for its strong reviews (95% on Rotten Tomatoes).",
      "\u201cThe internet\u2019s exploding right now between Friday and today. You just see that people are having a great time with it,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldstein, president of global distribution for Warner Bros. \u201cIt starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.\u201d",
      "The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. The superhero movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut, but stumbled in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d which got a healthy start at the No. 2 spot during its premiere weekend, came in fourth place, earning $10.4 million domestically. \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d had a similar fate, reaching the fifth position with $8.4 million in North American theaters.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d which came in seventh this week, is expected to hit $800 million globally by Monday, according to NBC Universal, following a successful run in theaters.",
      "Warner Bros. started off slow this year, but made a comeback with the box-office hit, \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which opened with $157 million domestically. Since then, movies like \u201cSinners,\u201d \u201cSuperman\u201d and now, \u201cWeapons,\u201d have found success.",

      "The Sunday streets of the borough of churches still vibrate with gospel chords, yet inside many of Brooklyn\u2019s storied Black sanctuaries, the choir lofts have thinned dramatically",
      "NEW YORK (RNS) \u2014 On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand\u2011claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. The borough still has a church on nearly every block, but over the years, the number of people in the pews has thinned.",
      "Many church choirs in the heart of Brooklyn, however, have kept singing \u2014 despite boasting fewer singers than in years past as neighborhoods face gentrification and organized religious affiliation decreases.",
      "Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard \u201cGod Is\u201d on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as \u201cjoy in sorrow\u201d and \u201cstrength for tomorrow.\u201d Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.'",
      "As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,\u201d said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she\u2019s been a congregant for six years. \u201cI really feel sometimes like it\u2019s not just me singing, it\u2019s my lineage singing.\u201d",

      "Founded in 1847, Concord Baptist Church is Brooklyn\u2019s oldest historically Black congregation. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center.",
      "Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today.",
      "\"The songs that uplifted us and kept us going through the midst of our misery \u2014 music is who we are,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.\u201d",
      "According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% \u2014 the largest decline among major U.S. religious groups. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and its impact is visible in the thinning choir stands.",
      "Glenn McMillan, Concord\u2019s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish.",
      "\u201cIn the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,\u201d McMillan said. The choir at Concord has shrunk from about 50 voices before the pandemic to 30 today, McMillan said. Back in 2006, the choir featured 100 voices.",
      "According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in\u2011person worship.",
      "\u201cThe internet has taken over and streaming has taken over,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.\u201d",
      "McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen more people showing up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m begging people my age to come to Concord,\u201d said Howard, the youngest member of the gospel choir, adding that only a handful of people around her age attend the church.",
      "Gwen Davis, a senior member of Berean Baptist Church and a choir soloist for more than 40 years, recalled Easter services in the mid\u20111960s, when over 400 people filled the pews and four separate choirs led the congregation in song.",

      "Today, Davis said, a typical service attracts approximately 150 people, and roughly 100 virtually. Over time, Berean\u2019s choirs have consolidated into a single mass choir with approximately 20 singers.",
      "A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had music every day,\u201d said Davis, who attended high school in the 1970s in central Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t think the children are learning notes and sharps and clefs. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.\u201d",
      "During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFor me, singing is not just singing, it\u2019s ministry,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSome of these old hymns were composed years and years ago, and those old hymns have sustained a people \u2014 many people.\u201d",
      "Gentrification is another force reshaping Brooklyn. Between 2010 and 2020, Crown Heights lost nearly 19,000 Black residents while gaining about 15,000 whites, according to 2020 Census data. More than 75% of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents in 2000 were Black, while in 2020, around 41% were Black.",
      "Those demographic shifts have hit historically Black Catholic parishes hard. St. Teresa of Avilain Crown Heights, which was the first church in the nation to hold Mass in Creole, will close by the end of the year. The anticipated closure demonstrates a wider pattern of Catholic churches that serve people of color closing, often attributed to declining attendance.",
      "For Mike Delouis, 38, St. Teresa\u2019s longtime cantor and a son of Haitian immigrants who was baptized at the church, the loss is personal.",
      "\u201cSinging for me is not about performance but about participation,\u201d said Delouis, who juggles three services most Sundays between St. Teresa and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. \u201cSt. Augustine said singing is praying twice.\u201d",
      "Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. \u201cEven through the process of gentrification, there are people that hear the music and they come in,\u201d he said.",
      "In June, from his place in the choir loft, Delouis heard the priest announce the church\u2019s closure. The words hit hard. \u201cIt was actually kind of hard to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, no \u2014 we can\u2019t let this happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. She began singing at age 6 in the junior choir, and when she turned 18, she transitioned to its Gratitude choir, which her older siblings also joined. \u201cIt was the young hip gospel choir of the church,\u201d Walters said.",
      "Today, Gratitude no longer exists in the same way. Its members are older and often reunite only for special occasions, such as singing at funerals. Over the decades, Walters has also watched the congregation itself shift demographics.",
      "\"When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,\u201d Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. \u201cIn the years that would come, itwas primarily a Black church.\u201d It later became home to a large West Indian population, and today includes many members of Guyanese heritage.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I couldn\u2019t break down the history of Brooklyn in a way that says who came first,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other\u2019s pain and celebrate each other\u2019s joys.\u201d",
      "McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. \u201cChoir singers are some of the most faithful churchgoers,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cA choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.\u201d",
      "Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to follow in that tradition,\u201d she said.",

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",

      "McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn\u2019t as simple as many seem to believe.",
      "The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 course of action if there are no residents or structures is to let them burn or \u201cit is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\u201d McMullen said.",
      "Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren\u2019t practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.",

      "President Donald Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the \u201c big beautiful bill,\u201d blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider.

      "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "CHICAGO -- One called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice.\u201d Another referred to himself as a \u201czealot\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. Several have played prominent roles in defending their state's abortion restrictions in court and in cases that have had national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has offered shifting positions on the issue while indicating he wants to leave questions of abortion access to the states. But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations \u201care a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,\u201d she said.",
      "Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any of Trump's judicial nominees support increased access to abortion.",
      "\"Every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling,\" a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said in a statement that referenced the 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump\u2019s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d",
      "Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. By the end of that term, more than one-quarter of active federal judges were nominated by Trump, including three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. Among them, four nominees are from Missouri and five are from Florida.",
      "Here is a look at the nominees who have tried to reduce abortion access or have advocated for restrictions. They did not respond to requests for comment:",
      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent. The lawyer also worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that opposes abortion and has sued to reverse the FDA approval of mifepristone.",

During the ensuing legal battles, Divine represented the state in defending a host of abortion restrictions.",

That included a law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and describe images to abortion patients.",
      "\u2014 Bill Mercer, a Republican state lawmaker in Montana who is nominated for a U.S. District Court judgeship in the state, has repeatedly supported anti-abortion bills. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion.",

      "CHICAGO -- A review by The Associated Press shows that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal courts have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Several have helped defend their state's abortion restrictions in court and some have been involved in cases with national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "While Trump has said issues related to abortion should be left to the states, the nominees, with lifetime appointments, would be in position to roll back abortion rights long after Trump leaves the White House.",

      "In the years before his most recent presidential campaign, Trump had voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks in pregnancy and said he might support a national ban around 15 weeks. He later settled on messaging that decisions about abortion access should be left to the states.",
      "Throughout his campaign, Trump has alternated between taking credit for appointing the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and striking a more neutral tone. That's been an effort to navigate the political divide between his base of anti-abortion supporters and the broader public, which largely supports access to abortion.",
      "One Trump nominee called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\" while another referred to himself as a \u201czealot\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. A nominee from Tennessee said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "One from Missouri spread misinformation about medication abortion, including that it \u201cstarves the baby to death in the womb\u201d in a lawsuit aiming to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.",

      "The lawyers argued late Wednesday that no solid evidence had been presented to prove that Bolsonaro acted against Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions or incited others to do so, and said the fact that he allowed the presidential transition to proceed contradicts the basic allegation that he plotted to thwart it. \u201cThis is evidence that eliminates the most essential of the accusatory premises,\u201d they said.",

      "EL ALTO, Bolivia -- Barred from appearing on Sunday\u2019s ballot, former leftist president Evo Morales has launched a scrappy campaign for a presidential contender with no name, no face and no formal platform.",
      "The contender's known as \u201cNulo\" \u2014 Spanish for the null-and-void vote.",
      "Nulo has a reliable base in Bolivia, where voting is compulsory. For many years, voters disillusioned with Morales' increasingly high-handed attempts to prolong his presidency over three consecutive terms defaced their ballots or left them blank.",
      "But with the coca-farming union leader disqualified from the race and seeking to distance himself from the unpopular President Luis Arce and other leftists associated with Bolivia's worst economic crisis in four decades, Morales has emerged as Nulo's greatest champion.",
      "\u201cBrothers, we are on the right track. Absenteeism, blank ballots, undecided voters, all of it,\u201d Morales told Radio Kawsachun Coca, his media outlet in the Bolivian jungle of Chapare, where he has been holed up for months among fiercely loyal coca-growing labor unions.",

      "But under Bolivian law, Nulo cannot win the elections\u2014 nor trigger a redo. Because authorities must remove spoiled and blank ballots from the final count, a surge by Nulo would give all the candidates a boost without affecting the distribution of votes.",

      "To run for a third term in 2014, Morales changed the Constitution\u2019s two-consecutive-term limit and stacked the top courts with his supporters.",
      "To run for a fourth term in 2019, he found a way around a referendum blocking his bid. That last attempt six years ago led to Morales resigning under pressure from the military and fleeing into exile as violent protests erupted over his disputed reelection.",
      "This time, with his ally-turned-rival Arce in power, Morales had all the cards \u2014 rather, courts \u2014 stacked against him.",

      "A new study warns that rising sea levels could threaten Easter Island\u2019s iconic moai statues by the end of the century",
      "By the end of the century, rising sea levels could push powerful seasonal waves into Easter Island\u2019s 15 iconic moai statues, according to a new study published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. About 50 other cultural sites in the area are also at risk from flooding.",
      "\u201cSea level rise is real,\u201d said Noah Paoa, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa\u2019s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s not a distant threat.\u201d",
      "Paoa, who is from Easter Island \u2014 known to its Indigenous people as Rapa Nui \u2014 and his colleagues built a high-resolution \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the island\u2019s eastern coastline and ran computer models to simulate future wave impacts under various sea level rise scenarios. They then overlaid the results with maps of cultural sites to pinpoint which places could be inundated in the coming decades.",
      "The findings show waves could reach Ahu Tongariki, the largest ceremonial platform on the island, as early as 2080. The site, home to the 15 towering moai, draws tens of thousands of visitors each year and is a cornerstone of the island\u2019s tourism economy.",
      "Beyond its economic value, the ahu is deeply woven into Rapa Nui\u2019s cultural identity. It lies within Rapa Nui National Park, which encompasses much of the island and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The roughly 900 moai statues across the island were built by the Rapa Nui people between the 10th and 16th centuries to honor important ancestors and chiefs.",
      "The threat isn't unprecedented. In 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded \u2014 a magnitude 9.5 off the coast of Chile \u2014 sent a tsunami surging across the Pacific. It struck Rapa Nui and swept the already-toppled moai further inland, which damaged some of their features. The monument was restored in the 1990s.",
      "While the study focuses on Rapa Nui, its conclusions echo a wider reality: cultural heritage sites worldwide are increasingly endangered by rising seas. A UNESCO report published last month found that about 50 World Heritage sites are highly exposed to coastal flooding.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, a UNESCO spokesperson said climate change is the biggest threat to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage marine sites. \u201cIn the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- Japanese pop idol Kenshin Kamimura was found guilty of a charge of indecent assault on a female interpreter in a Hong Kong court Wednesday before some emotional fans.",
      "Kamimura, a former member of a Japanese boy group named ONE N\u2019 ONLY, was arrested in the southern Chinese city in March. In the same month, his contract was terminated due to a serious compliance violation. In April, he pleaded not guilty.",
      "He allegedly touched the interpreter\u2019s thigh repeatedly during a celebratory dinner at a restaurant.",
      "During the trial last month, the interpreter testified through a live video link that Kamimura had invited her to a bathroom elsewhere. After she dismissed the request and told him she had a boyfriend, Kamimura continued to touch her thigh, she said.",
      "The defense argued the interpreter exaggerated her claims and the alleged bathroom invitation might not have been based on improper motives.",
      "Judge Peter Yu handed down the conviction Wednesday, saying Kamimura touched the intrepreter in a caressing nature that implicitly carried a sexual undertone and had indecent intent.",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s acts are obviously disrespectful toward women,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSuch behaviour should be condemned.\u201d",
      "In pleading for a lesser penalty, the defense said Kamimura previously had a promising future and paid a heavy price.",

But Kamimura looked relieved and hugged his courtroom translator when the judge issued a fine of 15,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $1,900) and no prison term. The maximum penalty for the charge is 10 years of imprisonment.",
      "The singer's supporters, including some from Japan and mainland China, formed long lines inside the court building to secure a seat in the main courtroom before the hearing. After the hearing, they waited outside to see Kamimura, who did not speak before leaving in a car.",
      "Others from mainland China who attended said they were not fans but wanted to learn more about the case, especially after seeing criticism of the female interpreter online.",
      "University student Betty Zhong from the Chinese city of Shenzhen said she was not a Kamimura fan but attended the court hearings in Hong Kong because a friend likes the J-pop idol and she wanted to know what happened.

      "Lee\u2019s two-day visit to Japan Aug. 23\u201324 will be an opportunity to deepen personal ties with Ishiba and put bilateral relations on firmer ground. Their talks will center on strengthening trilateral cooperation with Washington, promoting \u201cregional peace and stability,\u201d and addressing other international issues, presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said Wednesday.",
      "Their meeting will come weeks after South Korea and Japan secured trade deals with Washington that shielded their trade-dependent economies from Trump\u2019s highest tariffs. The separate agreements negotiated their rates of reciprocal duties down to 15% from the originally proposed 25%, but only after pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. investments.",
      "Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it hopes Lee\u2019s visit will promote the \u201cstable development\u201d of bilateral ties as their countries work together on international challenges. It said the two governments plan to maintain close communication, including utilizing the \u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d of regular leadership summits used in the past.",
      "After meeting Ishiba, Lee will travel to Washington for an Aug. 25 summit with Trump, which his office said will focus on trade and defense cooperation.",
      "Relations between the two U.S. allies often have been strained in recent years over grievances stemming from Japan\u2019s brutal colonization of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.",
      "Lee and Ishiba previously met on the sidelines of the June G7 meetings in Canada, where they called for building a future-oriented relationship and agreed to cooperate closely on various issues including trade and countering North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.",
      "Lee\u2019s meeting with Ishiba is clearly intended as preparation for the tougher challenge of the summit with Trump, who has unsettled allies and partners with tariff hikes and demands to reduce reliance on the U.S. while paying more for their defense.",
      "Lee could seek tips from Ishiba, who already has met Trump, and their governments may feel an urgent need to cooperate and respond jointly to challenges posed by Washington, said Park Won Gon, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Ewha University.",
      "The setup also may help revive the trilateral summits initiated under former President Joe Biden, which would make more sense than dealing with Trump separately, Park said, noting South Korea and Japan share strategic interests.",
      "\u201cThey are the only countries that have signed special measures agreements on sharing defense costs with the United States,\" Park said. \"Both depend on U.S. extended deterrence to cope with North Korean threats.

      "A U.N.-backed commission has found widespread and systematic violence against civilians in Syria's coastal region",
      "BEIRUT -- A U.N.-backed commission that investigated sectarian violence on Syria\u2019s coast earlier this year found that there was \u201cwidespread and systematic\u201d violence against civilians perpetrated by some government-affiliated factions, but found no evidence that it was directed by the central government.",
      "An extensive report released Thursday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria examined the violence that began with clashes between armed groups aligned with former Syrian President Bashar Assad and the new government\u2019s security forces in March. It then spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks and massacres that killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority to which Assad belongs.",
      "The violence came months after Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive in December and at a time when the country's new rulers were attempting to forge a new national army out of a patchwork of former insurgent factions.",
      "The commission named several government-affiliated factions whose members allegedly took part in \u201cextrajudicial killings and torture and ill-treatment of primarily the civilian population of Alawi majority villages and neighborhoods in a manner that was both widespread and systematic\" during the coastal violence.",
      "They include the 62nd and 76th divisions of the new Syrian army, also known as the Sultan Suleiman Shah Brigade and the Hamza Division \u2014 both of them formerly part of a coalition made up of Turkish-backed armed factions in northwest Syria. The report also singled out the 400th Division, made up of former brigades of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist rebel group that was formerly led by Syria's current interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "However, the report said the commission \"found no evidence of a governmental policy or plan to carry out such attacks.\" It also found that pro-Assad armed groups had committed \u201cacts that likely amount to crimes, including war crimes\" during the violence.",
      "A separate investigation into the coastal violence ordered by the government released its findings last month. It concluded that some members of the new Syrian military had committed \u201cwidespread, serious violations against civilians,\u201d but said there was no evidence that military leaders had ordered those attacks. The government investigation found that more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed.",
      "In a letter in response to Thursday's U.N. report, Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said the government takes \u201cserious note of the alleged violations\u201d detailed in it the report and said that the recommendations \u2014 which included increased screening of recruits to the security forces and recruiting from minority communities \u2014 \u201cwill serve as a roadmap for Syria's continued progress.\u201d",
      "The U.N. commission's report noted that in the leadup to the coastal violence in March there had been scattered clashes between pro-Assad and new government forces as well as increasing incidents of \u201charassment and violations\" against Alawite communities, \"including killings, abductions, looting or occupation of property.\u201d",
      "In early March, pro-Assad armed groups launched a series of attacks on the General Security forces of the new government along the coast. During the clashes that followed, pro-Assad fighters also overran hospitals, shot at and abducted journalists coming to cover the conflict, and in at least one case shot and killed women and children, the report said.",
      "With the General Security forces overwhelmed, tens of thousands of fighters from allied factions, as well as armed civilians, converged on the coast. Many began raiding houses in Alawite-majority areas, where in many cases they \u201casked civilians whether they were Sunni or Alawi\u201d and \u201dAlawi men and boys were then taken away to be executed,\u201d the report found.",

      "The report also found that there had been widespread cases of robbery and looting by armed groups.",
      "The commission also investigated reports of kidnapping of Alawite women and found \u201ccredible information\u201d of at least six cases in the weeks preceding and following the main outbreak of violence in March. It is investigating \u201cdozens\u201d of other reports. In at least two of the confirmed cases, the victims were \u201cabducted for the purpose of forced marriage,\u201d while in other cases, the kidnappers demanded ransoms from the victims' families.",

      "\u201cThe Commission is not aware of any individuals being arrested or prosecuted yet in connection with these abductions,\u201d the report said.",
      "The investigation into the coastal violence comes as Syria is reeling from another outbreak of sectarian violence last month that has again threatened the country's fragile political transition after nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "This time, clashes broke out in the southern Sweida province between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side, and fighters from the country\u2019s Druze minority on the other. Hundreds were killed and tens of thousands displaced, and allegations have surfaced of government fighters executing Druze civilians and looting and burning houses.",
      "The government has again launched an investigation into the allegations, but minority communities have become increasingly wary of the Sunni Muslim-led authorities. Last week, representatives of Syria\u2019s various ethnic and religious groups held a conference in Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syrian city and called for the formation of a decentralized state and the drafting of a new constitution that guarantees religious, cultural and ethnic pluralism.",

      "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan says Israel and Kurdish fighters should stop threatening Syria's security and stability",
      "ANKARA -- Israel and Kurdish fighters should stop threatening the security and stability of Syria, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Wednesday.",
      "Speaking at a news conference in Ankara with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani, Fidan accused Israel and the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, of undermining the country\u2019s efforts to reestablish itself after more than a decade of civil war.",
      "He said Israel had \u201cfueled certain difficulties\u201d in Syria and warned that Israeli security \"cannot be achieved through undermining the security of your neighbors.\"",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, you should make sure your neighboring countries are prosperous and secure. If you try to destabilize these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.\u201d",
      "Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December, the new interim government in Damascus has struggled to maintain stability and heal the wounds of the nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "Most recently, hundreds were killed in clashes in the southern province of Sweida between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side and fighters from the Druze minority on the other.",
      "Meanwhile, tensions have also risen between the central government and the U.S.-allied SDF that controls northeastern Syria. Implementation of an agreement reached in March to merge the SDF with the new Syrian army has stalled and there have been scattered outbreaks of violence between the two sides.",
      "Last week, representatives of Syria\u2019s various ethnic and religious groups held a conference in the northeastern Syrian city of Hassakeh \u2014 which is under the SDF's control \u2014 and called for the formation of a decentralized state and the drafting of a new constitution that guarantees religious, cultural and ethnic pluralism.",
      "The Syrian government criticized the meeting, and alleged that among the attendees were some with secessionist ambitions. It said that as a result it long longer intends to join planned talks with the SDF in Paris that had been agreed upon in late July. No date had yet been set for the Paris talks.",
      "Fidan accused the SDF of trying to turn instability in Syria into an \u201copportunity for themselves.\u201d",
      "Ankara views the SDF with hostility as the group is spearheaded by the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, affiliated with the Kurdish group that recently entered a peace process with Turkey after more than 40 years of fighting.",

      "He added: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t take us for fools. We have good intentions, but that doesn\u2019t mean we will turn a blind eye to your mischievous or devious ways.\u201d",
      "Turkey has been supportive of Syria\u2019s new administration, which is formed largely by rebels that Ankara backed during the civil war.",
      "\u201cNot every actor in the region is as constructive as us,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cThere are certain people who have been meddling in the affairs of Syria, chief among them the Israeli administration.\u201d",
      "Al-Shibani, meanwhile, said Israel\u2019s actions \u201cundermine the security of our citizens,\u201d adding that \u201ccertain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts.\u201d",

      "The storm hit Taitung county on the east coast shortly after noon, moving across the south of the island at about 36 kilometers (22 miles) per hour.

      "Taiwanese media reported one person missing on the east coast.",
      "Typhoons like Podul typically hit Taiwan's east coast hard before losing speed and strength as they pass over the Central Mountain Range before continuing toward the Chinese coast. Podul measured 120 kilometers (75 miles) across and was expected to broaden even while losing strength as the storm moved westward.",

      "Along with flooding, typhoons routinely damage fruit and other cash crops and bring landslides through the island\u2019s center. Much of central and southern Taiwan was badly hit by heavy rains in recent weeks that caused severe damage to crops but minimal casualties, while also knocking out electricity to rural areas that took weeks to repair.",

According to Gallup\u2019s data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol\u2019s risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that\u2019s a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn\u2019t include younger people and couldn\u2019t prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "The federal government\u2019s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup\u2019s director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans\u2019 lives may be a reason they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\u201cOlder folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\u201d Saad said. \u201cIt may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they\u2019ve grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\u201d",

In sharp contrast with Gallup\u2019s findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans\u2019 reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question\u2019s history.",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren\u2019t causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one\u2019s health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",
      "Overall, only about one-quarter of Americans who drink said they had consumed alcohol in the prior 24 hours, a record low in the survey. Roughly 4 in 10 said that it had been more than a week since they had poured a drink.",

      "Founded by George Eastman in 1880, Eastman Kodak Co. is credited with popularizing photography at the start of the 20th century and was known all over the world for its Brownie and Instamatic cameras and its yellow-and-red film boxes. It was first brought down by Japanese competition and then an inability to keep pace with the shift from film to digital technology.",
      "Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after struggling with increasing competition, continuing growth in digital photography and growing debt. The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later. At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.",
      "Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals. Production at the retrofitted facility is expected to start later this year.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has seen a record increase in tariff income, with a 273% rise in customs revenue from last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.",
      "Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.",
      "If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.",
      "While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d",
      "In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.",

      "For instance, on Monday, Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days, which preserves the 30% tariffs he had imposed as a condition for negotiations. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that \u201call other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.\u201d Beijing, at the same time, also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce.",

      "The automaker\u2019s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford\u2019s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cIn our careers, as automobile people we\u2019re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,\u201d CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. \u201cAnd I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.\u201d",
      "The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.",
      "The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.",
      "The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.",
      "The automaker sees this as a \u201cModel T moment\u201d for its EV business \u2014 a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model-T,\u201d Farley said.",
      "The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.",

It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an \u201cassembly tree\u201d at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.",
      "Other specifications for the midsize electric truck \u2013 including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times \u2014 will be announced later, the company said.

      "Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.",

      "Their Aug. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country\u2019s top export to the United States.",
      "South Korea also agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and invest $350 billion in the country, and Lee and Trump may discuss how the investment package will be structured and managed. The talks are expected to cover expanding cooperation in key industries such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, Lee\u2019s spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said.",
      "Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs.",
      "Lee's meeting with Trump comes amid concerns in Seoul that the Trump administration could shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and possibly move to reduce it as Washington shifts more focus on China.",
      "Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies\u2019 defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a \u201cfuture-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance\u201d to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn\u2019t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed.",
      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil.

      "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing baseball star Shohei Ohtani",
      "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.",
      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan's Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2013 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",
      "\u201cOhtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\u201d the brochure says. \u201cHe also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\"",
      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Bolivia's governing Movement Toward Socialism party won't have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- For most of Renan Aliaga\u2019s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of Bolivia: Evo Morales.",
      "Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth.",
      "But when Aliaga goes to the polls on Sunday to vote for Bolivia's next president, he won\u2019t see Morales' name on the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him.",
      "In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won\u2019t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded \u2014 not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin.",
      "Under MAS, Bolivia enjoyed years of a fixed exchange rate, low inflation and subsidized energy. Now, high inflation, a scarcity of imported goods and fuel shortages have beset the country.",
      "Arce handed the reins to a little-known minister, Eduardo Del Castillo.",
      "The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president \u2014 both of whom have run and lost three times before \u2014 and a young leftist Senate leader.",
      "Unsatisfied, Aliaga, a 39-year-old bus driver and former MAS voter, says he'll make a last-minute decision.",
      "\u201cThe right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,\u201d he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners \u2014 businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga \u2014 built their careers.",
      "\u201cBut the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,\u201d Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom.",
      "The main issues in this hotly contested election are Bolivia's long-standing leftist economic model, its democratic integrity and the livelihoods of millions of people undergoing the country's worst financial crisis in four decades.",
      "\u201cThis seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,\u201d Bolivia political analyst Ver\u00f3nica Rocha said.",
      "Tensions within MAS can be traced to Morales' disputed 2019 reelection. Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez took office in what many view as a coup.",
      "Violent clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 37 people.",
      "Morales returned to Bolivia following the 2020 election victory of his former finance minister, Arce.",
      "But their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce\u2019s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales\u2019 arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms.",
      "\u201cMAS torpedoed its own chances of winning this election,\u201d said Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.",
      "A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia\u2019s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term.",
      "Ever since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times \u2014 twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he\u2019s hoping the fourth time\u2019s the charm.",

      "A rare centrist candidate, lawmaker Rodrigo Paz and his media-savvy running mate, ex-Police Captain Edman\u202fLara, have recently energized young voters with TikTok videos from the campaign trail. With Doria Medina and Quiroga neck and neck, Paz could play kingmaker.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended.",
      "After the most recent round of China-U.S. trade talks, held late last month in Stockholm, Chinese and U.S. officials said they expected the deadline to be extended for another 90 days. The U.S. side said the decision was up to President Donald Trump. So far there has been no formal announcement about whether he will endorse an extension or push ahead with the higher tariffs.",
      "The uncertainty has left businesses in limbo and a decision to raise the import duties could jolt world markets.",
      "Trump has repeatedly shifted deadlines and tariff rates, and neither side has indicated what it plans for Tuesday. Extending the Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl.",
      "Higher tariffs are aimed at offsetting the huge, chronic U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a 21-year low in July as the threat of tariffs bit into Chinese exports.",
      "It's not unusual for the U.S. to give hints on where talks stand, but it's rare for China to make announcements until major decisions are set. So far, Beijing's refrained from commenting ahead of Tuesday's deadline.",
      "In an interview with Fox News taped on Thursday but aired on Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Trump was considering additional tariffs on Beijing because of China's purchases of Russian oil. But he said Trump \u201chasn't made any firm decisions.\u201d",
      "Prohibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of people reliant on \u201cgig work,\u201d crimping the job market.

      "For now, imports from China are subject to a 10% baseline tariff and a 20% extra tariff related to the fentanyl issue. Some products are taxed at higher rates. U.S. exports to China are subject to tariffs of around 30%. Before the two sides called a truce, Trump had threatened to impose 245% import duties on Chinese goods.

      "Organizers of the Los Angeles Olympics will sell naming rights for a handful of its venues in deals expected to bring multiple millions of dollars to the 2028 Games while breaking down the International Olympic Committee's long-sacrosanct policy of keeping brand names off its arenas and stadiums.",
      "The organizing committee announced the landmark deal Thursday, saying contracts were already in place with two of its founding partners \u2014 Honda, which already has naming rights for the arena in Anaheim that will host volleyball, and Comcast, which will have its name on the temporary venue hosting squash.",
      "LA28 chairman and CEO Casey Wasserman said revenue from the deals goes above what's in LA's current $6.9 billion budget.",
      "He portrayed the deal as the sort of paradigm-shifting arrangement that Los Angeles needs more than other host cities because, as is typical for American-hosted Olympics, the core cost of these games aren't backed by government funding.",
      "\u201cWe're a private enterprise responsible for delivering these games,\u201d Wasserman said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt's my job to push. That doesn't mean we're going to win every time we push, but it's our job to always push because our context is pretty unique.\u201d",
      "Wasserman said he also spent time explaining to IOC members how arena and stadium names are part of the lexicon in American sports.",
      "\u201cPeople know \u2018Crypto\u2019 as 'Crypto,' they don't know it as \u2018the gymnastics arena downtown,\u2019\" Wasserman said of the home of the Lakers, Crypto.com Arena, which will host gymnastics and boxing in 2028.",
      "Rights for up to 19 temporary venues could be available. The IOC's biggest sponsors \u2014 called TOP sponsors \u2014 will have first chance to get in on the deals. Wasserman said no venues will be renamed \u2014 so, for instance, if organizers don't reach a deal with SoFi (opening and closing ceremonies, swimming) or Intuit (basketball), no other sponsor can put its name on the arena.",
      "Not included in this new arrangement are the LA Coliseum, Rose Bowl and Dodger Stadium, some of the most iconic venues in a city that hosted the Olympics in 1932 and 1984. Organizers said IOC rules that forbid advertising on the field of play will still apply.",
      "The deal adds to a growing list of accommodations pushed through for Los Angeles, which is once again poised to reshape the Olympic brand, much the way it did in 1984.",
      "In 2017, the city was bidding for the 2024 Olympics against Paris, but agreed to instead host the 2028 Games. It was part of a then-unheard-of bid process that rescued the IOC from the reality that cities were becoming reluctant to absorb the cost and effort to bid for and host the Summer Games.",

      "The Minnesota Twins are no longer for sale after a 10-month exploratory process, according to executive chair Joe Pohlad",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins are no longer for sale, executive chair Joe Pohlad announced Wednesday on behalf of his family.",
      "After exploring a variety of options since publicizing the sale 10 months ago, the Pohlad family will remain the principal owner of the club and add new investors instead. Carl Pohlad, a banking magnate and the late grandfather of Joe Pohlad, purchased the Twins in 1984 for $44 million.",
      "\u201cFor more than four decades, our family has had the privilege of owning the Minnesota Twins. This franchise has become part of our family story, as it has for our employees, our players, this community, and Twins fans everywhere,\" Joe Pohlad said in his announcement. \u201cOver the past several months, we explored a wide range of potential investment and ownership opportunities. Our focus throughout has been on what\u2019s best for the long-term future of the Twins. We have been fully open to all possibilities.\u201d",
      "Pohlad said the family was in the process of adding two \u201csignificant\u201d limited partnership groups to bring in fresh ideas, bolster critical partnerships and shape the long-term vision of the franchise that relocated to Minnesota in 1961 after originating as the Washington Senators. Details about the new investors were being kept private until Major League Baseball approval of the transactions, Pohlad said.",
      "Financial analysis earlier this year by Forbes valued the franchise at $1.5 billion, ranked 23rd in MLB. Sportico ($1.7 billion) and CNBC ($1.65 billion) pegged them higher.",
      "The Pohlads hired Allen & Company, a New York-based investment bank, to direct the sale and keep inquiries confidential. Multiple published reports identified Justin Ishbia, a part owner of the NBA's Phoenix Suns, as the front-runner. But the Chicago White Sox announced last month that Ishbia was becoming a limited partner in a deal that provides a runway for him to become controlling owner.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged during the All-Star break, without naming him directly, that Ishbia's decision sidetracked the process.",
      "\u201cThere will be a transaction,\" Manfred said. \"You just need to be patient while they rework.\u201d",
      "The Twins are on track for their lowest attendance total in 16 seasons at Target Field, and an ownership-mandated payroll reduction last year in light of decreased regional television revenue, among other factors, has contributed to a dissatisfied customer base. The Twins traded 10 players off their roster leading up to the July 31 deadline, furthering the frustration.",
      "Word that the Pohlads are staying put certainly won't help the morale of Minnesota baseball fans, who've been waiting for another World Series title since 1991 and saw the investment in the roster plunge right after an American League Central title in 2023. The Twins won a playoff series then, too, their first in 21 years.",
      "\u201cWe see and hear the passion from our partners, the community, and Twins fans. That passion inspires us,\" Pohlad said. \"This ownership group is committed to building a winning team and culture for this region, one that Twins fans are proud to cheer for.\u201d",

Shortstop Carlos Correa was sent to the Houston Astros in a pure salary dump that reunited the three-time All-Star with his original team, which inherited $70 million of the more than $103 million that remained on his contract.",
      "Pohlad, in an interview with the Minnesota Star Tribune published immediately after the announcement, said he understands the bad feelings from the fans and looks forward to helping rebuild the brand and the roster. He said one of the investment groups is made up of Minnesotans and the other is a family based on the East Coast.",
      "Pohlad also said the teardown of the roster was not driven by a request from ownership to further cut costs.",
      "\u201cIt certainly set us up for more flexibility, but they were primarily baseball decisions,\" Pohlad told the Star Tribune.",

      "The 35-year-old right-hander struck out three, walked one and hit two batters before exiting with Texas down 5-1. He got a no-decision because Rowdy Tellez homered in the bottom of the ninth for the Rangers to tie the game at 6 and force extra innings.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d said Wilson, who registered her 30th career 30-point game and sixth this season. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know, as many greats as we have in this league, it\u2019s kind of a shocker that it\u2019s just now happening. It\u2019s a blessing. I love what I do. I love what I do.

      "Monica Seles first noticed the symptoms of myasthenia gravis \u2014 a neuromuscular autoimmune disease she discussed during a recent interview with The Associated Press \u2014 while she was swinging a racket the way she'd done so many times during, and after, a career that included nine Grand Slam titles and a place in the International Tennis Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI would be playing with some kids or family members, and I would miss a ball. I was like, \u2018Yeah, I see two balls.\u2019 These are obviously symptoms that you can\u2019t ignore,\u201d Seles said. \u201cAnd, for me, this is when this journey started. And it took me quite some time to really absorb it, speak openly about it, because it\u2019s a difficult one. It affects my day-to-day life quite a lot.\u201d",
      "The 51-year-old Seles, who won her first major trophy at age 16 at the 1990 French Open and played her last match in 2003, said she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis three years ago and is speaking publicly about it for the first time ahead of the U.S. Open, which starts on Aug. 24, to raise awareness about what is known as MG.",
      "The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke calls it \u201ca chronic neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the voluntary muscles\u201d and \u201cmost commonly impacts young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60) but ... can occur at any age, including childhood.\u201d",
      "Seles said she'd never heard of the condition until seeing a doctor and being referred to a neurologist after noticing symptoms such as double vision and weakness in her arms \u2014 \u201cjust blowing my hair out ... became very difficult,\u201d she said \u2014 and legs.",

Then, obviously, becoming a great player, it\u2019s a reset, too, because the fame, money, the attention, changes (everything), and it\u2019s hard as a 16-year-old to deal with all that.

      "Paramount and UFC have announced a billion-dollar rights deal, marking a significant shift for the fight company",
      "Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company\u2019s new streaming home.",
      "That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.",
      "Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely going to happen,\" White told The Associated Press. \u201cThink about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.\u201d",
      "The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.",
      "White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet \u2014 a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.",
      "ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights \u2014 White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms \u2014 but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.",
      "The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,\u201d White said. \u201cThey're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.\u201d",
      "The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC\u2019s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans \u2014 with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.",
      "Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. \u201cas they become available in the future.\u201d",
      "UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.",
      "\u201cThis is a 1-of-1 event,\u201d White said.",
      "There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d \u201cRoad To UFC,\u201d and \u201cDana White\u2019s Contender Series.\u201d It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.",

Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal \u2014 with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way.",
      "\u201cIt will affect fighter pay, big time,\u201d White said. \u201cFrom deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.\u201d",
      "Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model \u2014 which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events \u2014 should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.",
      "\u201cEvery fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cGet your worth boys and girls.\u201d",
      "White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead.",
      "There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo \u00c1lvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not run it\u2019s course,\u201d White said. \u201cThere were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren\u2019t. Wherever we ended up, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to roll with.\u201d",
      "White said UFC archival footage \u201ckills it\u201d in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.",
      "Just when it seems there's little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there's always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports?",
      "\u201cYou have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming. We\u2019re coming for all of them.\u201d",

      "After losing to Detroit on July 6 \u2014 just over a month ago \u2014 the Guardians had dropped 10 in a row and trailed the AL Central-leading Tigers by 15 1/2 games. That lead is now six. If Cleveland actually catches Detroit and wins the division, it would be the biggest comeback in the divisional play era.",

      "1978 New York Yankees (14 games): New York won the AL East thanks to Bucky Dent's homer in a one-game playoff at Fenway Park, and although this was a painful episode in Red Sox history, the Yankees won this more than Boston lost it. New York went 30-9 to finish the regular season. After stumbling in early September, the Red Sox later won eight in a row to force the playoff.",
      "1995 Seattle Mariners (13 games): After a win on Aug. 2, the California Angels led Seattle by 13 in the AL West and Texas by 11. Then the Angels went 22-34 the rest of the way while the Mariners were 36-20. When the teams met in a one-game playoff, it was a 9-1 blowout in Seattle's favor, and although wild cards were in the playoffs for the first time, California couldn't even salvage one of those.",
      "2012 Oakland Athletics (13 games): Fresh off two straight pennants, the Texas Rangers led the Angels by 6 1/2 and the A's by 13 at the end of June. But Oakland went 33-13 down the stretch, forcing the Rangers to settle for a wild card.",

      "One person who helps facilitate that is backup Ryan Staub, who started the final game of the 2023 season for Colorado when Shedeur Sanders was injured. Sure, Lewis may be the new kid and Salter the veteran, but Staub knows the ropes around the program.",

      "Outgoing USA Gymnastics president and CEO Li Li Leung is looking forward to a break",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Li Li Leung repeats the question out loud, leans back, and then does something that\u2019s been all too rare during her transformative tenure as the president and CEO of USA Gymnastics.",
      "She stops.",
      "\u201cWhat have I learned?\u201d Leung says again.",
      "After a brief exchange to buy some time, she settles on an answer that, in typical Leung fashion, says a lot by saying only a little.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t had time (to think about it),\" Leung told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the whole point, is like, I haven\u2019t had time to digest everything that has happened over the past six years.\u201d",
      "One of the many reasons \u2014 and perhaps the main reason \u2014 it's time to step away.",
      "From the day Leung walked into the organization's then dungeon-like Indianapolis office (it has since moved to one with far more natural light) in March 2019 at the height of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, through this weekend's U.S. Championships, she has been in perpetual motion.",
      "And while partial blame falls on Leung's inherent work ethic, the reality is the former Michigan gymnast knew she didn't really have a choice. One of the crown jewels of the U.S. Olympic movement was in tatters, fiscally \u2014 USA Gymnastics had all of six weeks of cash flow at the time Leung took over \u2014 and, far more pressingly, culturally.",
      "Trust, both internally and externally, had eroded. Restoring it would take time. It would also take the kind of compassion that Leung's immediate predecessors had been unable to muster.",
      "Before Leung accepted the job, one of her mentors told her to avoid trying to \u201cboil the ocean,\u201d that trying to become everything to everyone was a fool's errand.",
      "It might have been the one bit of advice she received that she didn't take.",
      "\u201cMy response to him was, 'Well, I\u2019m going to boil as much of it as I can,'\" Leung said.",
      "And while the former NBA executive began the process of trying to keep the organization financially viable, Leung knew early on that the most important aspect of her mission was to restore faith among the organization's hundreds of thousands of members, and just as vitally, the hundreds of women who were abused by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment.",
      "While Leung was limited in what she could say publicly as the lengthy mediation process between USA Gymnastics and the survivors played out, she and USAG board chair Kathryn Carson made it a point to attend dozens of hearings, listening to the experiences of the women abused by Nassar and using quiet moments when the tape recorder was off to reconnect.",
      "\u201c(We) had the opportunity to express personally how much we cared about trying to do the right thing and heard their stories directly,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThere were a lot of tears.\u201d",
      "And eventually, progress. While the record $380 million settlement offered a bit of closure, Leung understood it was merely one milepost in a process that she understands will never be over.",
      "When Leung told the organization's leadership group in early June that she was stepping down at the end of the year, her message wasn't to reflect on how far the organization has come, but how far there still is to go.",
      "\u201cI was like \u2018You guys got this,\u2019\u201d Leung said. \u201cAnd they have it. I mean, I think I have instilled in them that we\u2019re never done. There\u2019s always more that can be done, always challenge ourselves to be better. We talk about it in our meetings all the time. \u2018What else can we be doing better?\u2019 And I think they understand that.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons why Leung is hesitant to reflect. Growing up in New Jersey, her parents instilled in Leung and her twin sister May May a humbleness that even now, after steering USA Gymnastics out of the darkness, she is reluctant to turn the spotlight on herself.",
      "Leung would much rather deflect, pointing out that the work of the team she assembled is just as important as anything she has done.",
      "It's a trait that \u2014 along with her background in a sport that can be equal parts thrilling and unforgiving \u2014 helped her navigate those crucial early days when everything felt so tenuous.",

      "\u201cShe did not allow herself to get rattled at times that any of the rest of us might have been,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThe biggest thing that she did was exercise her passion for the sport by being just there in the community, everywhere, with every different type of person.\u201d",
      "And do it quietly. Of the many things Leung is, the one thing she is not is performative. When she came on, the list of people critical of the organization was long, loud, distinguished, and, well, justified in its frustration and anger.",
      "While Leung had nothing to do with the systemic breakdowns that created a culture in which the balance of power tilted too far away from the athletes, she understood how important it was to let those most affected be heard and part of the solution.",
      "Leung had been on the job five months when Olympic champion Simone Biles, herself a Nassar survivor, called out USA Gymnastics ahead of the 2019 U.S. Championships for its repeated inability to protect its athletes. Five years later, Biles credited the organization for \u201c putting in the work \u201d to make the changes necessary to restore trust.",
      "Three decades ago, Dominique Moceanu became the youngest national champion in USA Gymnastics history. A year later, she was part of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that earned Olympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.",
      "Moceanu also \u2014 long before Nassar's crimes came to light \u2014 became an outspoken critic of coaches who were physically and emotionally abusive. She felt like a \u201cpariah\" and figured her relationship with USA Gymnastics was over.",
      "Yet there she was on Sunday night, waving to the crowd inside the Smoothie King Center on the 30th anniversary of her triumph, a full-circle moment that wouldn't have happened without Leung and the changes Moceanu \u2014 who now runs her eponymous gym with her husband Mike just outside Cleveland \u2014 sees in the sport at large.",
      "\u201cLi Li\u2019s been a constant and a stable leader, which has been very good, and I think there are things that are shifting,\u201d Moceanu said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a sign that USAG is starting to heal as well, in a sense, from the wounds and the damage and everything that had happened.\u201d",
      "The healing process, however, is far from over. And Leung is acutely aware that all the progress that's been made over the last six years can unravel quickly without constant vigilance.",
      "\u201cWe want to make our environment as unwelcome a place as possible for predators,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of a philosophy that we use when we talk about how we try to mitigate (problems). How we try and have zero tolerance and create accountability.\u201d",
      "It's telling of how far USA Gymnastics has come on just about every front that a job nobody wanted six years ago \u2014 not even Leung, initially \u2014 is suddenly remarkably more attractive. It helps that membership has risen to more than 240,000 athletes, coaches and gym owners during Leung's watch. The corporate sponsors that fled after Nassar have returned. Just last week USA Gymnastics announced a partnership with NBC Sports that will run through the 2032 Olympics.",
      "Leung is serving as an advisor in the search for her successor. While she thinks it would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d if the next president was a gymnast, she strongly believes whoever it is must be a former athlete.",
      "\u201c(They need) someone who understands sports and understands high-pressure environments and high-pressure competition, in order for that person to be successful,\" she said.",
      "As for Leung, she says she wants a break. The last few months have been challenging in her personal life, reinforcing the need for her to step away and hit reset.",
      "How long that might take, she's not sure, pointing out that how she feels in early August might not be the way she feels on Dec. 31.",
      "Leung has received numerous overtures from other entities in recent years as USA Gymnastics found itself on increasingly firmer footing. She said no to them all. She might say no to them some more before moving on to what's next.",
      "The one thing she will do, however, is listen. If Leung has learned anything over the last six-plus years, it's that. Listening leads to growth, a personal philosophy that has also become one of USA Gymnastics' guiding principles.",
      "Yes, she could use the next three years in the run-up to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics as a victory lap. That's simply not her way. Her goal when she arrived was to leave the gymnastics community at large in a better place than she found it. While she wouldn't trade a second of the journey it's taken to do just that, she's also aware of the toll it has taken personally.",
      "\u201cThe parallel or the analogy that I would draw to gymnastics is staying in competitive shape this entire time, with no rest,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s only sustainable for so long. So I\u2019m going to finally get my rest.\u201d",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Shohei Ohtani's latest home run binge hasn't been enough to spark the Los Angeles Dodgers out of a summer malaise that's endangering their customary perch atop the NL West.",
      "Ohtani homered in his third straight game Monday night, hitting his 42nd of the season in the eighth inning of the Dodgers' 7-4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels.",
      "The Dodgers trailed 7-0 when Ohtani connected off Shaun Anderson with one out, driving his fourth homer in five games into the right field bleachers to tie Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber for the NL lead. Seattle's Cal Raleigh leads the majors with 45 homers.",
      "Ohtani also started a rally: Mookie Betts and Will Smith then singled before Max Muncy brought them home with his 17th homer, trimming the Dodgers' deficit to three runs and inspiring thunderous roars from the Dodgers fans comprising more than half of the Angel Stadium crowd.",
      "But the Dodgers got no closer, with Connor Brogdon and longtime Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen calmly wrapping up the sub-.500 Angels' fifth consecutive win over their crosstown rivals.",
      "The loss shrunk the Dodgers' lead over San Diego in the NL West to just one game \u2014 the smallest cushion since June 14.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a really bad loss for us,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really any way of getting around that.\u201d",
      "Ohtani has a 10-game hitting streak in August, his longest of the season, and he has four homers among his nine hits in the Dodgers\u2019 last five games. The two-way superstar is the presumptive front-runner for his fourth MVP award.",
      "Despite his heroics, the Dodgers are 10-12 since the All-Star break.",
      "With meager production across their lineup and inconsistent relief pitching just when their problematic rotation finally started to click, they've only rarely looked like the juggernaut franchise that has won two of the past five World Series, four of the last eight NL pennants and 11 of the last 12 division crowns.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going well for us right now,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to snap out of it. No one is going to feel sorry for us. It\u2019s on us to find our way out of it, and we will.\u201d",
      "A day after the Dodgers' bullpen blew an eighth-inning lead in a 5-4 loss to Toronto, top starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto got raked by the Angels' largely average lineup for six runs on six hits and five walks, creating a hole the Dodgers couldn't escape. The Dodgers began the weekend with two solid performances against the AL-leading Blue Jays, only to fall back into another rut.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for some traction here, and trying to stack some wins,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cHate to say that yesterday\u2019s loss carried over to tonight. ... You win yesterday, and you feel even better about coming into today, but now you look at losing two games in a row. It\u2019s baseball, and we\u2019re good at resetting, coming back.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Six planets are hanging out in the sky this month in what's known as a planetary parade. Catch the spectacle while you can because it's the last one of the year.",
      "These linkups happen when several planets appear to line up in the night sky at once. Such parades are fairly common, happening around every year depending on the number of planets. At least one bright planet can be spotted on most nights, weather permitting, according to NASA.",
      "Six planets were visible in January skies and every planet of our solar system was visible in February, but not all could be spotted with the naked eye.",
      "Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and a faint Mercury are visible this month without any special equipment, and the best chances to spot them are over the next week. Uranus and Neptune can only be glimpsed through binoculars and telescopes.",
      "Jupiter and Venus made a close brush earlier this week and are still near each other in the eastern sky, \u201cclose together like cat's eyes,\u201d said Carolyn Sumners at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Mercury will be at its farthest point from the sun on Tuesday morning, making it easier to spot before it disappears into the sun's glare.",
      "To catch the planets, go out in the morning shortly before sunrise and look east. Try to find Jupiter and Venus clustered together first. Saturn is off to the side and Mercury will be close to the horizon, trying to rise before the sun.",

      "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns",
      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",

      "It turns out many Americans aren't great at identifying which personal decisions contribute most to climate change.",
      "A study recently published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when asked to rank actions, such as swapping a car that uses gasoline for an electric one, carpooling or reducing food waste, participants weren\u2019t very accurate when assessing how much those actions contributed to climate change, which is caused mostly by the release of greenhouse gases that happen when fuels like gasoline, oil and coal are burned.",
      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",
      "How the human brain is wired also plays a role.",
      "\u201cYou can see the bottle being recycled. That\u2019s visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",
      "Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations.",
      "\u201cThere has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.",
      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",
      "\u201cPeople just don\u2019t associate pets with carbon emissions. That link is not clear in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Zhao said.",

      "Planes emit a lot of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, also greenhouse gases. Additionally, planes emit contrails, or vapor trails that prevent planet-warming gases from escaping into space. A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.",
      "Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates.",
      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.",

      "The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. Mashpee resident Jennifer Sullivan took a video of it swimming alongside paddle boarders in an inlet behind a marina surrounded by sea grass.",
      "She said on Monday that she found the manatee, which was as long and wide as her paddleboard, \u201cjust lazing around there in the grass going as slowly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was completely unfazed by us,\" said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt \u201cjust in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.\u201d",
      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",

      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",
      "Scientists collected water from 53 locations in Xochimilco: 10 inside refuges where water is filtered and the water is cleaner and 43 outside those areas. They found axolotl DNA inside the protected areas and in one site outside them.",
      "Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said \u201cit\u2019s very little,\u201d but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals.",
      "So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year.",
      "The trend, however, is not good. From an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in 1998, there were only 36 per square kilometer in the last census, in 2014.",

      "Farmers in Kenya face challenges with elephants raiding crops and sometimes causing harm",
      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",
      "Changing crops can also make a difference. Elephants love maize and watermelons. But sesame? Blegh.",

    "story": [
      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

      "Drones also can have mid-air collisions or tumble from the sky. But people have accepted the risk of road accidents because they know the advantages of driving, Enayati said. She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",
      "\u201cI love to go outside, wave at the drone, say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and get the food,\u201d Julep Toth said.",

      "The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.",
      "It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.",
      "But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.",
      "That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.",
      "Rising power bills are \u201csomething legislators have been hearing a lot about. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive outcry.\u201d",
      "Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.",
      "\u201cA lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. \u201cI think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.\u201d",
      "A fix, Peskoe said, is a \u201ccan of worms\" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.",
      "Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.",
      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",
      "But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

      "New York\u2019s legal marijuana agency allowed dozens of cannabis dispensaries to open too close to schools after regulators misread state law and are now pushing for a legislative fix to prevent the pot shops from having to relocate",
      "Since New York began licensing recreational marijuana stores about three years ago, the state has been using a simple tactic to ensure pot shops are kept a legally-mandated distance from local schools: Measure from the door of the dispensary to the door of the school.",
      "But officials recently made a startling admission: They\u2019d misread the law and had been measuring incorrectly the whole time. Now, about 100 cannabis shops are in limbo, crossing their fingers for a legislative fix while wondering whether they\u2019ll have to relocate.",
      "The news was like dropping \u201ca grenade in the laps\u201d of business owners, said Osbert Ordu\u00f1a, who owns a New York City dispensary called The Cannabis Place that is now deemed to be too close to a nearby preschool.",
      "\u201cThe way that they executed this was a complete and utter failure in leadership,\u201d he said.",
      "The admission is just the latest bungle from New York\u2019s beleaguered legal marijuana program, which has been hamstrung by legal challenges, a slow rollout and gaps in the law that allowed an illicit market to flourish.",
      "Business owners found out about the issue from the Office of Cannabis Management last month, which admitted it should have been measuring from the edge of a school\u2019s property line, rather than its entrance, to ensure weed stores were kept at least 500 feet (152 meters) away.",
      "\u201cTo give you this news, and for the weight of it, I am incredibly sorry,\u201d said Felicia A.B. Reid, acting executive director of the cannabis agency, said in notices to the businesses.",
      "The error impacts a sizable share of the state\u2019s roughly 450 cannabis dispensaries.",
      "About 60 of those were licensed using the erroneous measurement system, mostly in New York City, plus around another 40 that have licenses but are yet to open their doors.",
      "On top of that, there are almost 50 other businesses that have applied for licenses under the incorrect measurement system and are awaiting final approval from the agency. The state has set aside a pot of money where applicants can get up to $250,000 to help relocate.",
      "The existing shops have been told they can remain open for now, and even continue to operate with their expired licenses as long as the businesses file an application for a renewal.",

      "Jillian Dragutsky, who opened a dispensary called Yerba Buena in Brooklyn a few months ago, worries the issue still jeopardizes a dispensary\u2019s ability to bank, get insurance and purchase inventory since they are supposed to have valid licenses in place.",

      "Gendron, who is white, could face the death penalty if convicted in the 2022 mass shooting at a Tops supermarket, which he targeted because of its location in a primarily Black neighborhood. Those killed ranged in age from 32 to 86. Three others were wounded.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago this week, he vowed it would provide economic stability to older people while giving the U.S. \"an economic structure of vastly greater soundness.\u201d",
      "Today, the program provides benefits to almost 69 million Americans monthly. It's a major source of income for people over 65 and is popular across the country and political lines.",
      "It also looks more threatened than ever.",
      "Just as it has for decades, Social Security faces a looming shortfall in money to pay full benefits. Since President Donald Trump took office the program has faced more tumult. Agency staffing has been slashed. Unions and advocacy groups concerned about sharing sensitive information have sued. Trump administration officials including the president for months falsely claimed millions of dead people were receiving Social Security benefits. Former top adviser Elon Musk called the program a potential \u201cPonzi scheme.\"",
      "Trump and other Republicans have said they will not cut Social Security benefits. Yet the program remains far from the sound economic system that FDR envisioned 90 years ago, due to changes made \u2014 and not made \u2014 under both Democratic and Republican presidents.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at past and current challenges to Social Security, the proposed solutions and what it could take to shore up the program.",
      "The so-called go-broke date \u2014 or the date at which Social Security will no longer have enough funds to pay full benefits \u2014 has been moved up to 2034, instead of last year\u2019s estimate of 2035. After that point, Social Security would only be able to pay 81% of benefits, according to an annual report released in June. The earlier date came as new legislation affecting Social Security benefits have contributed to earlier projected depletion dates, the report concluded.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law by former President Joe Biden and enacted in January, had an impact. It repealed the Windfall Elimination and Government Pension Offset provisions, increasing Social Security benefit levels for former public workers.",
      "Republicans\u2019 new tax legislation signed into law in July will accelerate the insolvency of Social Security, said Brendan Duke at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t laid out an idea to fix it yet,\" he said.",
      "The notion of privatizing Social Security surfaced most recently when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this month said new tax-deferred investment accounts dubbed \u201c Trump accounts \u201d may serve as a \u201c backdoor to privatization,\" though Treasury has walked back those comments.",
      "The public has been widely against the idea of privatizing Social Security since former President George W. Bush embarked on a campaign to pitch privatization of the program in 2005, through voluntary personal retirement accounts. The plan was not well-received by the public.",
      "Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University professor and top economist in Bush\u2019s White House, told The Associated Press that Social Security needs to be reduced in size in order to maintain benefits for generations to come. He supports limiting benefits for wealthy retirees.",
      "\u201cWe will have to make a choice,\" Hubbard said. \u201cIf you want Social Security benefits to look like they are today, we\u2019re going to have to raise everyone\u2019s taxes a lot. And if that\u2019s what people want, that\u2019s a menu, and you pay the high price and you move on.\"",

      "\u201cSo much of what we hear is that its running out of money,\u201d said Becky Boober, 70, from Rockport, Maine, who recently retired after decades in public service. She relies on Social Security to keep her finances afloat, is grateful for the program and thinks it should be expanded.",
      "\u201cIn my mind there are several easy fixes that are not a political stretch,\u201d she said. They include raising the income tax cap on high-income earners and possibly raising the retirement age, which is currently 67 for people born after 1960, though she is less inclined to support that change.",

      "She also argues for shrinking the program to a point where every retiree would receive the same Social Security benefit so long as they worked the same number of years, which she argues would increase benefits for the bottom one-third of earners. How this would impact middle-class earners is unclear.",
      "\u201cWhen talking about needing to reform the system, we need to reform it so that we don\u2019t have indiscriminate 23% across the board cuts for everybody,\u201d Greszler said. \u201cWe need to reform the system in a more thoughtful way, so that we are protecting those who are most vulnerable and reliant on Social Security.\u201d",

      "In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump teased a name change for the center, formally the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and said it would be restored to its past glory.",
      "\u201cGREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,\u201d Trump wrote. He said work was being done on the site that would be \u201cbringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!\u201d he wrote.",
      "It is unclear how this year's honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role. Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin and Stephen Sondheim. A message sent to the Kennedy Center press office asking how this year's honorees were selected wasn\u2019t returned Tuesday.",
      "The Kennedy Center did post this on social media, however: \u201cComing Soon ... A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...\u201d",
      "In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and actor Sylvester Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. Anka was supposed to perform \u201cMy Way\u201d at Trump\u2019s first inaugural and backed out at the last moment.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors were established in 1978 and have been handed out to a broad range of artists. Until Trump\u2019s first term, presidents of both major political parties traditionally attended the annual ceremony, even when they disagreed politically with a given recipient.",

      "In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared that he would not attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump\u2019s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. Honorees during that time included such Trump critics as Cher, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Sally Field.",

      "The steps have drawn further criticism from some artists.

      "MIAMI -- A federal judge is set to hear closing arguments Wednesday over whether to stop construction indefinitely at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d as she considers whether it violates environmental laws.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a two-week halt on new construction last Thursday as witnesses continued to testify in a hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case.",
      "The temporary order doesn\u2019t include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity at the center, which is currently holding hundreds of detainees. The center, which was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport, is designed to eventually hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures.",
      "The order temporarily barred the installation of any new industrial-style lighting, as well as any paving, filling, excavating, fencing or erecting additional buildings, tents, dormitories or other residential or administrative facilities.",
      "Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe want Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction, which they say threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars\u2019 worth of environmental restoration.",
      "Plaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday who testified that the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects.",
      "Attorneys for the state and federal government have said that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the federal environmental review wouldn\u2019t apply.",
      "The judge last week said the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.",
      "Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers.",
      "Amy Castaneda, the Miccosukee Tribe's water resource director, testified Tuesday that nutrient runoff from the detention center could flow into tribal lands, changing vegetation growth. That could lead to fish kills and block humans and wildlife from moving throughout certain areas, she said.",
      "Marcel Bozas, director of the Miccosukee Tribe's fish and wildlife department, said tribe members hunt and fish for subsistence and cultural reasons. Sustained human activity can drive away game animals, like whitetail deer, as well as protected species, like Florida panthers, wood storks, eastern black rails and bonneted bats, he said.",

      "Attorneys for federal and state agencies last month asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida\u2019s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit because the detention center is in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state\u2019s middle district, they said.",

      "Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for Cubans fleeing communist rule at the height of the Cold War",
      "MIAMI -- For decades, its powerful lighthouse illuminated Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay, and during the height of the Cold War, what was known as the Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing communist rule.",
      "The 14-story Spanish Revival skyscraper was where, from 1962 to 1974, the U.S. State Department welcomed Cuban refugees with medical services, English classes, and comfort kits containing essentials and something wholly exotic to the new arrivals: peanut butter.",
      "After decades of neglect, what was once Miami\u2019s tallest building is getting a well-deserved facelift. Next month, it will reopen as a museum honoring the history of Cuban exiles with immersive, state-of-the-art exhibits that explore the meaning of migration, freedom and homeland.",
      "The reopening of what\u2019s dubbed the Ellis Island of the South comes at a sensitive moment. Cuban Americans \u2014 who dominate politics in Miami \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in the last presidential election. But the president\u2019s crackdown on migrants \u2014 including Cubans \u2014 is increasingly viewed as a betrayal and has left many second-guessing that support. Not surprisingly, recent protests against Trump have gathered outside the tower.",
      "The organizers of the museum, while tiptoeing around the present-day politics, are nonetheless unapologetic in their embrace of the American dream. In Miami, a thriving crossroads where 70% of residents speak Spanish as their first language and more than half are foreign-born, compassion for migrants runs deep.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cyclical,\u201d said Rene Ramos, the head archivist at Miami Dade College, which spearheaded the $65 million renovation. \u201cThis country has had moments where it clearly saw the value of immigrants and other moments when it did not. What we\u2019re doing here is reminding people what immigrants can accomplish when they\u2019re given the opportunity.\u201d",
      "The iconic building opened in 1925 as the headquarters of the once-acclaimed Miami Daily News, which shuttered decades ago. It was designed, in the style of a Moorish bell tower from Seville, Spain, by the New York architectural firm Schultze & Weaver, which was behind some of the most glamorous hotels, theaters and office towers of the era.",
      "It was renamed the Freedom Tower when President John F. Kennedy launched the Cuban Refugee Assistance Program to resettle the streams of middle-class individuals and families fleeing Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution. It\u2019s estimated that nearly 400,000 Cubans relied on services provided at the tower by the U.S. government in coordination with the then-fledgling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami. The total cost of the refugee assistance ran over $730 million by 1971 \u2014 almost $6 billion in today's dollars \u2014 a U.S. government report from that year found.",
      "Known to the Spanish-speaking migrants as \u201cEl Refugio,\u201d or \u201cThe Refuge,\u201d it was a safe place to get vaccines, fill out paperwork, and receive financial assistance of around $120 per month. In the Grand Hall, with its giant windows and Corinthian columns, the Pizarra de la Suerte \u2014 the Bulletin Board of Good Luck \u2014 carried job notices to help the Cubans adjust to their new life, according to a replica of the hall in the museum.",
      "At the time, metropolitan Miami was a tropical tourist town, with fewer than 1 million inhabitants. Most \u00e9migr\u00e9s fanned out across the United States.",
      "\u201cThey weren\u2019t staying in Miami because they didn\u2019t want warmth and sunshine. There were no jobs,\u201d said Madeline Pumariega, the president of Miami Dade College, whose own Cuban parents hightailed it to Amarillo, Texas, after arriving here.",

      "Jorge Malag\u00f3n, who teaches history at Miami Dade College, was just 5 when he arrived. But he still wells up recalling the hardship of his departure \u2014 when Cuban customs officials ripped open his teddy bear looking for contraband jewelry \u2014 and arriving in Miami on a \u201cFreedom Flight\u201d paid for by the U.S. government and being immediately shuttled in a school bus from the tarmac to the Freedom Tower.",

      "The Freedom Tower, a national historic landmark, was long ago overtaken by Miami\u2019s fast-growing steel and glass skyline. Abandoned for years, it was rescued in 1997 by Cuban American businessman Jorge Mas Canosa, a top exile opponent of Castro. He later sold it to a prominent Cuban American family and it was then donated to Miami Dade College.",
      "Even in a dilapidated state, the tower remained a mecca of the Cuban diaspora. In 2003, tens of thousands of salsa fans gathered here to show their respects to Cuban-born singer Celia Cruz. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose parents migrated from Cuba, used it as the backdrop to announce his bid for the U.S. presidency in 2015.",
      "The current restoration was funded by $25 million investment from the state of Florida, with additional funding from MDC, private donors and federal government grants.",
      "Galleries designed by the same firm behind New York City\u2019s National September 11 Memorial & Museum provide a gripping account of the Cuban American journey to freedom. They include exhibits dedicated to Victims of Communism, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that the CIA organized against Castro, and the 14,000 unaccompanied minors sent by their parents as part of the U.S.-led Operation Peter Pan.",
      "Giant media screens project scenes of protest and acts of courage by newer residents of the Magic City fleeing persecution in Venezuela, Haiti and Nicaragua. There\u2019s also a makeshift recording studio for those who passed through the Freedom Tower to add their testimony to an archive of over 300 oral history interviews with exiles, including prominent voices like singer Gloria Estefan.",
      "Emerging from the dark galleries of often traumatic stories of dislocation and exile, the museum\u2019s final stop is a gallery flooded with all the sun, salsa and pastel hues that make modern-day Miami so beloved.",
      "\u201cMiami and the world would not be what it is today without them,\u201d said Pumariega. \u201cThat\u2019s important and so is the contributions that immigrants play in our country, and I think will continue to play beyond this moment.\u201d",

      "U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, well short of the 115,000 analysts forecast. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.",
      "Without citing evidence, Trump accused McEntarfer of rigging the jobs data for political reasons. On Monday, Trump nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the BLS.",
      "While layoffs remain low by historical standards, there has been noticeable deterioration in the labor market this year and mounting evidence that people are having difficulty finding jobs.",
      "U.S. employers posted 7.4 million job vacancies in June, down from 7.7 million in May. The number of people quitting their jobs \u2014 a sign of confidence in finding a better job \u2014 fell in June to the lowest level since December.",

      "U.S. District Judge David Proctor wrote that University of Alabama students and professors who filed a lawsuit challenging the law as unconstitutional did not meet the legal burden required for a preliminary injunction, which he called \u201can extraordinary and drastic remedy.\u201d The civil lawsuit challenging the statute will go forward, but the law will remain in place while it does.",

      "Six professors and students at the University of Alabama filed a lawsuit arguing that the law violates the First Amendment by placing viewpoint-based restrictions on what educators teach. The lawsuit also said the law unconstitutionally targets Black students because it limits programs that benefit them.",
      "Professors said they had altered what they taught in their classes in the wake of the law and the university\u2019s guidance about it. A professor said he reduced coverage of the Black Power movement, the Black Lives Matter movement and the white nationalist movement in the wake of the law. Another said five students had made complaints suggesting that the interdisciplinary honors program she administered had potential conflicts with the new legislation.",

There were no reports of any untoward incident, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said, citing information from U.S. officials and a Philippine surveillance flight.",
      "The U.S. Navy has staged what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea for years to challenge China\u2019s restrictions and demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. That has angered China and its forces have had close runs-in with U.S. warships and aircraft on such patrols in international waters and airspace.",
      "The deployment happened after Washington\u2019s ambassador to Manila, MaryKay Carlson, condemned on Tuesday \u201cthe latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel\u201d in Scarborough.

      "Justice Department indictments have been unsealed against three leaders and two high-ranking enforcers of Mexico's United Cartels",
      "WASHINGTON -- The investigation began years ago after two drug dealers got into a car accident in a small Tennessee town. What followed was a series of secret wiretaps, a shootout with police and the discovery of drugs hidden in a tractor trailer that would eventually lead federal investigators back to cartel leaders in Mexico.",
      "The investigation culminated with Justice Department indictments unsealed Thursday against three leaders and two high-ranking enforcers of the United Cartels, a leading rival of Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "The U.S. government is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of United Cartels' top leader, Juan Jos\u00e9 Far\u00edas \u00c1lvarez \u2014 \u201cEl Abuelo,\u201d or the grandfather \u2014 along with multimillion-dollar rewards for the four others. All five are believed to be in Mexico.",
      "The cases, as outlined in court documents, provide a glimpse into how drugs produced by violent cartels in large labs in Mexico flow across the U.S. border and reach American streets. They also highlight the violent fallout that drug trafficking leaves in its path from the mountains of Mexico to small U.S. towns.",
      "\"These cases in particular serve as a powerful reminder of the insidious impacts that global cartels can have on our local American communities,\" Matthew Galeotti, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe chain started with a violent cartel in Mexico and it ended with law enforcement being shot at in a small town.\"",
      "United Cartels is an umbrella organization made up of smaller cartels that have worked for different groups over time. It holds a fierce grip over the western state of Michoacan, Mexico.",
      "United Cartels is not as widely known as Jalisco New Generation, but given its role as a prolific methamphetamine producer, it has become a top tier target for U.S. law enforcement. It was one of eight groups recently named foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "The case goes back to 2019, when two dealers got into a car accident in a small town outside Knoxville, Tennessee, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in court. While fleeing the scene of the crash, they threw a hardened protective case filled with meth behind a building before being caught by police, according to court documents.",
      "Authorities began investigating, using wiretaps, search warrants and surveillance to identify a man believed to be leading a major drug ring in the Atlanta area: Eladio Mendoza.",
      "The investigation into Mendoza's suspected drug operation led law enforcement in early 2020 to a hotel near Atlanta. During their surveillance, authorities spotted a man leaving with a large Doritos bag. Troopers tried to stop the man after he drove from Georgia into Tennessee but he fled and fired an AK-style rifle at officers, hitting one in the leg before another trooper shot him. Inside the bag, police found meth and heroin, and identified him as a low-level dealer for Mendoza\u2019s drug ring, court records say.",
      "Weeks later, authorities searched properties linked to Mendoza and seized phones. They discovered messages between Mendoza and a close associate of \u201cEl Abuelo,\u201d the leader of United Cartels, that showed the drugs were coming from Mexico, according to the court records. On one of Mendoza's properties, investigators found a tractor trailer that had crossed from Mexica days earlier. When they searched it, authorities seized 850 kilograms of meth hidden in the floor of the truck and discovered more drugs inside a bus and a home on the property, court papers say.",

      "School district officials have released text messages, personnel files and student records of the shooter from the 2022 attack at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 students and two teachers",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The teenage gunman in the 2022 Robb Elementary School massacre entered school in Uvalde, Texas, as a bright learner before years of escalating academic and behavioral troubles that preceded him opening fire on a fourth-grade classroom, according to records released Monday.",
      "The school files reveal in greater detail 18-year-old Salvador Ramos\u2019 downward spiral that authorities have well documented since the attack that killed 19 children and two teachers. One assessment shows Ramos described as a \u201cmotivated thinker and learner\u201d in kindergarten, but by middle school, he was suspended or written up multiple times for harassment, bullying and failing to meet the minimum statewide testing standards.",
      "In October 2021 \u2014 seven months before the shooting \u2014 Ramos withdrew from high school because of \u201cpoor academic performance, lack of attendance\" and records showed he had failing grades in nearly all classes.",
      "The records are among thousands of pages released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District following a yearslong legal battle to withhold documents connected to one of the deadliest classroom attacks in U.S. history.",
      "Many of the documents offer scant new revelations surrounding the attack and the gunman, whose troubled history has been laid out in previous state and federal investigations. Nor do the records \u2014 which do not include any video from the day of the shooting \u2014 shed light on the hesitant and widely criticized police response.",
      "The documents include the personnel file of former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, one of two officers facing criminal charges over the slow law enforcement response, and emails to and from school administrators in the days and weeks after the attack.",
      "At 11:40 a.m. on the day of the shooting, Arredondo received a text from a school district secretary noting that another employee reported hearing gunfire outside the school.",
      "\u201cThey went ahead and locked themselves down,\u201d the text to Arredondo read.",
      "Arredondo and Adrian Gonzales, another former Uvalde school district officer, are the only responding officers who face criminal charges for their actions that day. They both have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment and are scheduled for trial later this year.",
      "Media organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. A Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that the records must be released.",
      "The records are not the public\u2019s first glimpse inside one of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shootings and the slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body cam videos and recordings of 911 calls.",
      "Salvador Ramos' academic records showed a student who as a kindergartener was described as \u201ca remarkable little boy\u201d who was a \u201cvery hard worker,\u201d but he went on to be suspended multiple times in junior high and withdrew from high school because of \u201cpoor academic performance.\u201d",
      "The records showed a student spiraling further into academic and behavioral problems, cut classes and confrontations with teachers through middle school. By ninth grade, he was classified as \u201cat risk.\u201d",

      "Arredondo has been the target of much of the blame for the law enforcement response that saw nearly 400 local, state and federal officers wait more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers as parents outside begged them to go in.",
      "The Arredondo emails after the shooting show a chief still being asked questions about security at district events, concerns about someone who liked Ramos' social media posts and a note from a district administrator 12 days after the attack that asked: \u201cHow are you today?\"",
      "The Uvalde district placed Arredondo on paid leave on June 22 in a letter that told him he was not to enter any district building, go on any campus or attend any school activity. The letter also directed Arredondo to cooperate with any investigation and not to discuss the investigation with district employees.",
      "Text messages between a group of Uvalde school staffers show in the days after the shooting, officials briefly noted criticisms of the response but avoided responding via text message. One exchange noted a law enforcement timeline that included a 77-minute delay. Another referenced a news article where a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson was pressed on the delayed response.",

      "Taylor Swift gave fans a lot to look forward to after she appeared on \"New Heights,\" the podcast hosted by her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs star, Travis Kelce, and his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce, Wednesday night.",
      "Swift used the podcast episode to announce her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" which she was working on during the European leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour in 2024.",
      "\"This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,\" Swift said.",
      "Here are more details Swift shared about the upcoming album:",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" release date",
      "The album will be released on Friday, Oct. 3. Fans of Swift know the dates she chooses to announce and release music almost always have meaning and often have a 13, her lucky number, somewhere.",
      "\"Never not annoying,\" she said about herself on the podcast. \"Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation and this one was right there.\"",
      "Swift, Max Martin and Shellback produced the album",
      "Swift made \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with Max Martin and Shellback, producers she has worked with in the past but never for the entirety of an album.",
      "\"The three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before,\" Swift said. Those songs include \"22,\" \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Style,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"\u2026Ready For It?\" and \"Delicate.\"",
      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",
      "\"The best ideas we've ever had\"",
      "Swift said she approached Martin, who she described as her mentor, about doing an album at her Eras Tour show in Stockholm in May 2024.",
      "\"I essentially said to him, 'I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour and for the same reasons,' and he was like, 'Do you understand what kind of pressure that is?'\" Swift said.",
      "But Swift is confident in the outcome.",
      "\"We knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had, and I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much, and I'm so proud of it, and it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",
      "Asked by Jason Kelce why she chose orange for the color scheme of the album, Swift said, \"I've just always liked it, Jason.\"",
      "\"It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt, and this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,\" she said.",
      "There are 12 songs on the album",
      "Swift shared the titles of the 12 tracks on the album: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Elizabeth Taylor,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure,\" \"Eldest Daughter,\" \"Ruin The Friendship,\" \"Actually Romantic,\" \"Wi$h Li$t,\" \"Wood,\" \"Cancelled!,\" \"Honey\" and \"The Life of a Showgirl (Feat. Sabrina Carpenter).\"",
      "The pop star added that there are no additional songs, a departure from past albums. Her most recent release, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" had 31 songs.",
      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",
      "\"So it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there and it was just ideas flying and all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project.\"",
      "The album art",
      "The cover of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is a layered picture of Swift submerged in water.",
      "\"This represents the end of my night,\" she explained. \"When I'm on tour, I have the same day every single day \u2026 and my day ends with me in a bathtub.\"",
      "Swift wanted the cover to show something offstage to represent the theme of the album.",
      "\"This album isn't really about what happened to me on stage, it's about what I was going through offstage,\" she said. \"It's the life beyond the show.\"",
      "The images were captured by photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who Swift previously worked with for the album art for her sixth studio album, \"reputation,\" released in 2017.",
      "\"I loved what they did with those photos, so I called them up for this one, and I'm so happy with the way that the photos came out for this one,\" she said.",
      "The album was recorded in Sweden during the Eras Tour",
      "Swift traveled to Sweden on her off days while touring Europe during the Eras Tour to work on the album.",
      "\"I would be playing shows, I'd do like three shows in a row. I'd have like three days off, I'd fly to Sweden,\" she said. \"I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating.\"",
      "\"This album is going to make you dance\"",
      "Some additional details about \"The Life of a Showgirl\" came from Travis Kelce, who revealed he has heard the whole album.",
      "\"I know they're all 12 bangers,\" he said. \"It's a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more like fun pop like excitement. \u2026 I think it's a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on 'Tortured Poets' for sure.\"",
      "Swift confirmed that was a good way to describe the album, adding, \"Life is more upbeat.\"",
      "Travis later told Jason, \"you are going to move.\"",
      "\"This album is going to make you dance,\" he said.",

      "Taylor Swift appeared on the popular \"New Heights\" podcast alongside her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and opened up about their relationship, buying back the master recordings of her first six albums, Easter eggs and her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "Swift appeared on the prerecorded podcast released Wednesday, which is hosted by Travis Kelce and his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. The episode marks the couple's first comprehensive media appearance.",
      "\"This podcast did a lot for me,\" Swift said. \"It gave me a boyfriend!\"",
      "Kelce attended Swift's Eras Tour stop at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2023. At the time, Kelce shared on the podcast, he tried to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number; however, she never received it.",
      "Swift said Wednesday that the gesture made her feel \"like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was just like, standing outside of my window with a boom box being like, 'I want to date you.'\"",
      "Swift also spoke about buying back the master recordings from her first six studio albums. Swift described how she had wanted to own all her music after signing a record deal at age 15. She revealed that she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to talk with private equity company Shamrock Capital, which owned the masters at the time, about buying them.",
      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!' And I was heaving crying. This changed my life.\"",
      "\"I just started crying, too,\" Kelce said. \"I was just so happy for you.\"",
      "Swift announced her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" on 12:12 a.m. Tuesday, after putting out the word on her website. She revealed the cover art on Wednesday and that the album will be released on Oct. 3.",
      "Since Swift began releasing music at the age of 15, she has snuck hidden messages, or Easter eggs, into her work, social media posts and videos that fans try and decipher online. Swift said Wednesday that she is \"never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life.\"",
      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",
      "Swift revealed a recent Easter egg on the podcast about the descending orange door that appeared as a visual on the Eras Tour after the finale song, \"Karma.\"",
      "\"I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator, lift,\" Swift said. \"That's how every single Eras show ended \u2014 except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door, to be specific. And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the Eras Tour era, but I was also entering a new era.\"",
      "Swift said her upcoming album \"was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the Eras Tour.\"",
      "\"Literally living the life of a showgirl!\" Travis Kelce added.",

She didn't disclose the purchase price.",

      "Previous \"Taylor's Version\" releases have been more than conventional rerecordings, arriving with new \"from the vault\" music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work.",
      "So far, there have been four rerecorded albums, beginning with \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" and \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" in 2021. All four have been massive commercial and cultural successes, with each debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

A ten-time Grammy Award winner and the first-ever recipient of a Grammy for Latin music, Palmieri revolutionized the genre with his bold, percussive style and deep Afro-Caribbean roots, founding the groundbreaking band La Perfecta and mentoring generations of musicians over a remarkable seven-decade career. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 60 years, Iraida, whom he lovingly called 'Mi Luz Mayor,' and is survived by his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a global community of friends and collaborators who felt his passion and generosity. Featured proudly in Spike Lee's upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, Palmieri's influence transcended music -- his rhythm changed the world, and his spirit will live on in every beat he inspired.\"",

      "Palmieri was born in New York's Spanish Harlem on Dec. 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13 he began playing timbales in his uncle's orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed's band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez's before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Pioneering Grammy winner's career spanned decades and genres",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \"V\u00e1monos pa'l monte,\" with his brother, Charlie, as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:32:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices.

    "summary": "The lawsuit alleges that Early Warning Services, Zelle's parent, failed to implement safeguards, enabling fraudsters to steal more than $1 billion.",
    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Early Warning Services, or EWS, alleging the parent company of Zelle failed to implement certain safeguards, causing \"catastrophic harm to millions of consumers\" and allowing fraudsters to steal more than $1 billion from 2017 to 2023.",
      "EWS, which is\u00a0co-owned\u00a0by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo,\u00a0launched\u00a0the Zelle app in 2017. At its debut, Zelle\u00a0said the digital payment network would be a \"faster, safer way\" for people to send and receive payments \"within the security of their financial institution,\" according to the company.",
      "As of 2024, the app has 151 million users, according to Zelle's\u00a0website.",
      "The push to launch Zelle led to design oversights that made the network \"an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity,\" the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0alleges. Those alleged flaws include Zelle's quick registration process and lack of verification, which James claims made it easy for scammers to infiltrate the service.",
      "The limited information shown to customers during transactions also allowed fraudsters to use false or fraudulent email addresses to trick consumers, she said.",
      "\"EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks,\" the New York AG's office claimed in its statement.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that EWS failed to enforce rules to prevent fraud, even though it knew its partner banks were violating them.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Zelle spokesperson called the lawsuit a \"political stunt\" and said it was a \"copycat\" of a similar lawsuit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u00a0filed in December, which was dismissed in March. That lawsuit alleged EWS failed to protect consumers from widespread fraud.",
      "The lawsuit seeks restitution and damages for New Yorkers affected by fraud on Zelle, as well as a court order requiring the company to maintain anti-fraud measures.",

      "Louisville, Kentucky\u00a0\u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

The cautionary report comes just months after Spirit emerged from\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
      "In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to \"adverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",

      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",

      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 20:05:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The inflation rate was cooler than expected, with July's CPI rising 2.7% on an annual basis.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in July rose 2.7% on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",
      "FactSet gives an 88% probability of a rate cut at the meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

      "The iconic 133-year-old business cautioned Monday that there's \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern because it might not have the financial resources to meet its future debt obligations, according to an Aug. 11\u00a0regulatory filing. A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",
      "Its current financial crunch is tied to almost $500 million in short-term debt obligations, as well as more than $200 million in pension liabilities. Last year, Kodak had said it would end its pension plan in order to reduce debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Kodak should have \"a clear understanding by Aug.15 of how we will satisfy our obligations to all plan participants,\" Chief Financial Officer David Bullwinkle said in a statement, referring to the pension plan.",
      "A Kodak moment",
      "Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, founded by inventor George Eastman in 1892, mass produced the famed Brownie and Instamatic cameras, popularizing photography as a pastime for generations of Americans. Its yellow-and-red film boxes were ubiquitous in photo shops and other retailers.",
      "Eastman said his goal was \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil,\" according to the Kodak website.",
      "But Kodak faced competition from Japanese companies, including Fujifilm in the 1990s, as well as the shift to digital technology, leading to its filing for\u00a0bankruptcy protection in 2012.",
      "The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later.",
      "At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.",
      "Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals. Production at the retrofitted facility is expected to start later this year.",

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:17:15 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that he says will democratize alternative investments for workers saving for retirement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to democratize retirement by allowing 401(k)s to invest in so-called alternative investments, or strategies outside stocks and other traditional investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Thursday would open the door to higher-risk investments landing in your 401(k). It could also potentially serve as a game changer for the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for years has wanted to gain access to America's retirement plans.",
      "The move has the potential to shake up the typically staid menu of investment choices provided to workers through their employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b)s, with the latter aimed at teachers. The change might appeal to some savers, given that alternative investments can provide protection from market swings while also providing the potential for outsized returns. But there are several catches to be aware of, experts say.",
      "Private equity investments \"have matured into a strong-performing asset class delivering excellent long-term returns, so this is good news for Americans,\" Simon Tang, head of U.S. at Accelex, a private markets specialist, said in an email.",
      "But there are caveats, experts say. For one, some alternative investments carry higher risk profiles than traditional asset classes, and offer less transparency about their performance on a day-to-day basis. It's also unclear whether or not employers will want to offer such investments given the risks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "story": [
      "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.",
      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\"Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\"This case is about abuse of power,\" the lawsuit says. \"Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\"Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\"",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract\u00a0with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \"Japan's Babe Ruth\" and the \"1st Resident,\" giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \"one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\" Hapuna Beach, \"rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\" and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",
      "\"Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\" the brochure says. \"He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\"",
      "Ohtani touted the project as his upcoming \"winter home\" in April, CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV reported at the time",
      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \"as part of a bold marketing strategy\" signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \"one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",
      "\"This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\" the investment brochure said. \"We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\"",
      "The suit said Balelo \"quickly became a disruptive force,\" threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made.",
      "\"Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,\" the suit said. \"Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\"",
      "Last month, in what the suit called \"a coordinated ambush,\" Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.",
      "\"Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\" the suit said. \"Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"",
      "AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stocks for both companies rose slightly on Monday.",
      "Proponents of restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China say they are necessary to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge as the two countries battle for AI dominance. They've also been viewed as a security safeguard. In one instance during the Biden administration, the Commerce Department said it was updating its export controls and said advanced AI capabilities \"present U.S. national security concerns.\"",
      "\"These controls were strategically crafted to address, among other concerns, the PRC's efforts to obtain semiconductor manufacturing equipment essential to producing advanced integrated circuits needed for the next generation of advanced weapon systems,\" the department said in a 2023\u00a0release.",

      "The company unveiled its new \"universal EV platform\" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it \"the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" which Ford introduced in 1908.",
      "According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an \"assembly tree,\" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.",
      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",

      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",

    "story": [
      "Bed Bath & Beyond is making a comeback under a slightly different name, more than two years after filing for bankruptcy.",
      "The first Bed Bath & Beyond Home store will open in Nashville on Friday, a new version of the former big box retail store known for selling home furnishings, appliances and more, at mid-range prices. Overseeing the opening is The Brand House Collective, formerly known as Kirkland's, which manages a portfolio of retail stores including Beyond Inc.'s Bed Bath & Beyond Home, Bed Bath & Beyond, Buy Buy Baby and Overstock.",
      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",
      "\"We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today,\" Amy Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, said at the time.",
      "To lure former customers back in the door, Brand House said it would honor legacy Bed Bath & Beyond coupons \u2014 the big white and blue paper slips that have long been associated with the company.",
      "Hudgens said that honoring the legacy coupons was \"an opportunity to re-engage consumers.\" Brand Collective will determine the best distribution strategy for coupons as they expand their store base, he said.",
      "Asked whether Brand House plans to open more stores under the Bed Bath & Beyond Home moniker, Hudgens said, \"We are opening four additional Bed Bath and Beyond Home stores in the Nashville market and will be in an aggressive learn and react posture to determine appropriate merchandising, brand, and strategy shifts to make as we plan our opening strategy for 2026.\"",
      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer, which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",
      "With the\u00a0opening of the Bed Bath & Beyond Home store in Tennessee, Brand House Collective is taking a major step is resurrecting its troubled retail brands, according to John Bringardner, executive editor at Debtwire, an analytics platform that tracks companies in debt.",
      "\"The company has undertaken a massive turnaround effort, closing underperforming store locations, reducing excess inventory and creating a fresh new look and marketing plan,\" Bringardner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But its underlying financials remain deeply troubled and the success of the relaunch will be an uphill battle.\"",
      "Bed Bath & Beyond opened as a privately held business in 1971 and went public in 1992. It once had thousands of stores globally, according to data from\u00a0Statista.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's cut its sales outlook Friday, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Company executives discussed Wendy's challenges during a call with analysts Friday, following the release of its latest earnings report. Interim CEO Ken Cook said that in light of the current environment, the company now expects full-year global sales to decline between 3% and 5%, compared with previous\u00a0projections\u00a0of flat to down 2%.",
      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",
      "Among other value offerings is the Wendy's Biggie Bag, which features a junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink for $5.",
      "Asked about adjusting core menu pricing during Friday's call, Cook said the company plans to use new data analytics capabilities to evaluate its prices.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely something that we'll look at,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is working to make inroads with Latino voters ahead of the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, releasing her first Spanish-language radio ad on Thursday.",
      "The former congresswoman addresses rising costs, telling voters in Spanish, \"I know what it's like for families today. I got things done to lower costs. That's what I'll do as governor, too.\"",
      "Democrats across the country are working to regain the Latino support the party lost in the 2024 elections. President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election, outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters, and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier.",
      "But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better, compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026, 29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods.",
      "A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's \"meeting Latino Virginians where they are \u2014 on the ground and in-language \u2014 and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families, keeping communities safe, and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.\"",
      "Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population, according to the Census Bureau, and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart.",
      "\"We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican,\" Rocha said. \"She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better, and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now.\"",
      "Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs, housing and energy, as governor.",
      "Her ad also takes aim at her opponent, GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education.",
      "\"Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care, too,\" the ad says. \"We need a governor who fights for Virginia, not Trump.\"",
      "Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday, her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger, who represented Virginia in Congress for six years, as a \"Washington insider.\"",
      "She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad, saying that the former congresswoman \"voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time.\"",
      "\"That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards,\" Earle-Sears says in the ad. \"Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.\"",
      "Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration, since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June, Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: \"This November, Virginia gets to be the first to the polls, along with our friends up in New Jersey, to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.\""

    "story": [
      "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday, as lawyers for the Justice Department and the state of California argued over the validity of Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit and whether the Posse Comitatus Act \u2014 which generally bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement \u2014 applied to the troop deployment.",
      "Mr. Trump in June deployed 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, saying they were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement agents amid June protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. Newsom did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and responded with a lawsuit\u00a0requesting an injunction limiting the military's role in the city.",
      "In addition to claiming the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, argued that there is no precedent for the lawsuit, for injunctive relief or money damages under the act, and that Newsom and the state of California have not suffered the harm required to sue.",
      "\"It is, in fact, the federal government who is engaged in unprecedented conduct,\" said Deputy Attorney General Meghan Strong, representing the State of California, explaining that the government has never used the military in this way before.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer seemed perplexed by several of the government's assertions, particularly what he called the apparent \"absence of any limits to a national police force.\" He questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 19th century law at the center of this trial is not relevant, and the assertion that his court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the president.",
      "\"So then what is the remedy?\" Breyer asked Hamilton, raising the issue of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. \"You're saying there's a criminal remedy? The president can be prosecuted? You say that in light of the Supreme Court decision, the Trump decision. Isn't he immune?\"",
      "\"So that's it. Too bad. So sad. It's over,\" he added emphatically. \"And that's the end of the case.\"",
      "California has asked Breyer for an injunction that would allow the military to protect federal property \u2014 such as courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "\"The constitution and the law and the facts are on Governor Newsom's side,\" said Josh Kastenberg, a professor at the University of New Mexico Law School. \"But that doesn't mean he's going to win. Ever since World War II, the courts have embraced this military deference doctrine, which really is presidential deference in matters of military command and control.\"",
      "Questions over scope",
      "\"We're going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines that there's some threat to the safety of a federal agent,\" Breyer said to Hamilton. \"And it's his determination. Not mine, it's his. That's what you're saying. That's what the law is.\"",
      "Hamilton said that wasn't \"quite what I'm saying.\" He asserted the troops are not enforcing federal law, but providing protection, and that it is lawful for guardsmen and marines to provide protection for federal buildings \u2014 the one point he agreed with California's attorney on. But, he argued, there is no distinction between protecting federal property and protecting federal law enforcement working out in the field.",
      "Breyer pointed out that federal employees \"are everywhere.\"",
      "The judge further questioned why any National Guard members remain in Los Angeles, and expressed concern about the justification for continued operations. Hamilton testified that 300 guardsmen remain, a 90% reduction in the force. Strong countered that it is still a significant number of soldiers, and certainly enough to violate the law.",
      "\"Thank goodness for the National Guard, but why is the federalized National Guard still in place?\" asked Breyer. \"What's the threat today? What was the threat yesterday?\"",
      "\"I go back to the thing that I'm really troubled by: What limiting factors are there to the use of this force?\" he said, \"Once you have a force in place, and maybe legitimately do so, and the threat that gave rise to the force in that place subsides \u2026 how does one look at this national police force that goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws?\"",
      "Does the Posse Comitatus Act apply?",
      "Breyer appeared to take issue with the Justice Department's argument that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, noting that a key witness, Major General Scott Sherman \u2014 who was at one point the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 had testified that the troops were trained to act within the bounds of that law.",
      "\"Then why is it the excellent Major General sought assurance that the Posse Comitatus Act was followed?\" said Breyer. \"Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide, and regulation after regulation, and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act if the Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant?\"",
      "Strong argued that all of the Department of Defense's leaders agreed that the Posse Comitatus Act applied to the Task Force 51 troops in Los Angeles. She said they substituted the word \"protection\" for \"security\" when describing the troops' activities because they knew that \"security\" would violate the act.",
      "She asserted that the secretary of defense had released a memorandum invoking a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, and affirmatively instructing soldiers to engage in activities that violated it \u2014 but the memo was issued after those activities had taken place.",
      "On Tuesday, Sherman testified that he was advised of a \"constitutional exception\" that enabled the troops to conduct certain activities that would normally violate the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "Strong called this an attempt by the Department of Defense to justify their actions after the fact that \"itself reveals a knowledge and awareness of their violations.\"",
      "The federal government is \"disregarding the law, and so we need show nothing more than that,\" said Strong.",
      "She further argued that the Constitution seeks to make sure the president cannot control a standing army the way the king had in 1776. She said that it would deny the basic principles of federalism for the state to have \"no legal recourse to challenge the conduct of these troops.\"",
      "\"If you look at the plain language of the Posse Comitatus Act, and the fear of standing armies that existed at the time of the Constitution,\" Kastenberg said. \"... One of the biggest issues in the state conventions and in the framing of the Constitution to begin with was to significantly curtail the president's authority over the standing army, and keep the standing army very small.\"",
      "Breyer did not give a timeline for his ruling, stating at the end of the day, \"I will decide the case as soon as I can decide the case.\"",

    "summary": "As Texas hurtles toward a flashpoint on a GOP effort to redraw congressional districts, California Democrats are about to answer with a plan of their own.",
    "story": [
      "California Democrats are preparing to counter Republicans' attempt to reshape a series of Texas congressional districts for political advantage in a back and forth that could define next year's midterm elections and with it, the final two years of President Trump's second term.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office has announced plans for a major state announcement Thursday as national tensions rage over changing congressional lines mid-decade. Districts are usually redrawn after the decennial census. Newsom has vowed his state would respond after Texas Republicans released plans earlier this summer to redraw five seats held by Democrats and make them more favorable to the GOP.",
      "\"If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states,\" Mr. Newsom said in a recent letter to the president.",
      "Newsom's team participated in a series of conversations with the state's Democratic congressional delegation and the California Legislature as drafts of possible maps were discussed. According to U.S. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the conversations were initially centered on the question, \"Is this even conceptually possible?\"",
      "California Democrats concluded that it was possible to gain five Democratic seats to counter Texas' gains, according to Lofgren. \"I'm confident that if we need to move forward, we will do that successfully. There's tremendous unity on the Democratic side.\"",
      "Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and hold the White House. At the moment, if Democrats were to win back as few as three seats in next year's midterms, they could flip control of the House. That path would be threatened however if Republicans and Mr. Trump succeed in convincing GOP-led states like Texas, Indiana and Missouri to take some of their Democratic-held districts and alter them to favor Republicans instead.",
      "The potential developments in California Thursday come as Texas Republicans struggle to pass the maps that have become a national issue. Breakaway state House Democrats fled Texas earlier this month, denying the chamber the quorum it needed to take action on the new maps during a special legislative session.",
      "Since then, national Democrats have sought to call attention to what Republicans are trying to do in Texas, even as it's opened the left up to accusations of hypocrisy. During the standoff, some Texas Democrats have spoken out from Illinois, a blue state that was criticized for drawing its congressional maps after the 2020 Census to give Democrats the advantage.",
      "For both sides, the issue of congressional districts has become even more starkly partisan this summer. Various attempts have also been made in court to bring state House Democrats back to Texas, or to create a path that will help Republicans get their way.",
      "During a floor speech \u2014 before the maps passed the Texas Senate earlier this week in what amounted to a moot effort, given the House's obstacles \u2014 Republican Phil King bluntly said an objective of his \"was to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "With the special session in Texas set to end in just a few days, Republicans have been adamant about eventually passing the maps, even if it takes more time and special sessions. With Democratic power limited in the state, there is a sense that Republicans will eventually be able to get their way.",
      "But the situation has left an opening for Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to create a new front in the political fight, given that Democrats may have a path to redrawing Republican-held congressional districts in the blue state of California.",

      "In California, only nine of the state's 52 U.S. House districts are held by Republicans. Earlier this century, voters in the state signed off on putting in the state's constitution an independent citizens redistricting commission to decide new boundaries following the once a decade census process.",

In Texas, GOP leaders and Mr. Trump allies just need to go through the normal legislative process to change districts.",
      "Because of California's constitution, changing the redistricting process in the state ahead of the 2026 midterms would likely require a new amendment. To take effect, it would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election. That election could prove costly, with major implications for the country on the line.",

      "\"I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deployment of members of the National Guard to D.C. on Monday and said the federal government would also take control of the D.C. police. In an executive order Monday, the president directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\"",
      "The 1973 law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by up to 30 days by notifying Congress, which the president has done. Any extension beyond 30 days requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate.",
      "Speaking at the Kennedy Center, Mr. Trump said he expects Congress to extend the federal takeover, saying, \"We think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously.\"",
      "\"We're going to need a crime bill that we're going to be putting in and it's going to pertain initially to D.C.,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days.\"",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in both the House and Senate, the extension would require the support of at least seven Democrats to advance, since most legislation functions under a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats.",
      "The president said he could extend the takeover without Congress' help \"if it's a national emergency,\" but he said, \"I don't want to call a national emergency.\"",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday said he would block the Trump administration from using a federal building in New York City to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it reduces the number of detainees and improves conditions at the site, including by providing sleeping mats and hygiene products.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued the temporary restraining order after holding a hearing earlier Tuesday. A government lawyer conceded in court that those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, at the Manhattan facility did not have access to certain services, including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication and more than two meals per day.",
      "The holding facility in question, located inside the 26 Federal Plaza building in downtown Manhattan, has been at the center of widespread criticism from pro-immigrant advocates, who have denounced conditions faced by detainees there as \"inhumane.\" Video released last month showed detainees at the facility lying on the ground, without mats or beds.",
      "ICE has said the site has fewer services because it is not designed for long-term detention, though government data indicates some detainees have been held for days there.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security denied allegations of substandard conditions in ICE's detention system and vowed to appeal the order.",
      "\"Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. \"Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.\"",
      "Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates filed a lawsuit against ICE over the 26 Federal Plaza holding facility, alleging that detainees there were being held in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products. The advocates said detainees only received two \"inedible\" meals daily and were denied access to unrestricted calls with lawyers.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Oestericher said the government did not dispute that detainees at the facility only received blankets, not beds or sleeping mats. He confirmed detainees get two meals each day \u2014 not three \u2014 and that the toilets for detainees are inside the same area where they sleep. Oestericher said the facility does not permit in-person visitations due to its \"layout\" and noted the government did not dispute claims that detainees lack access to medication.",
      "In his order later Tuesday, Kaplan placed restrictions on how many people ICE can hold at the Manhattan site, prohibiting the agency from using holding rooms with a floor area that is less than 50 square feet per detainee.",
      "Kaplan said ICE could only hold people at the facility if it offered them regular calls with lawyers, clean bedding mats, know-your-rights notices, access to medication, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products. He also ordered ICE to ensure the holding areas are cleaned three times each day.",
      "Tuesday's temporary restraining order is set to last for 14 days. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied allegations of subpar conditions at ICE detention centers.",
      "\"Today's order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,\" said Eunice Cho, a senior attorney at the ACLU.",

There are two toilets with sinks in the back of the room, only separated by half walls with no doors. One of the two toilets is covered with a foil blanket.",
      "The legal fight over the Manhattan holding facility comes at a time when ICE is detaining record numbers of people facing deportation. On Tuesday morning, ICE was holding nearly 60,000 detainees in detention centers throughout the U.S., according to internal agency data.",
      "As part of President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE has sought to expand its detention system by bringing new facilities online, brokering agreements with states willing to convert local sites into immigration detention centers and using military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, as deportation staging hubs.",

      "At issue in the three-day bench trial pitting Newsom against the Trump administration is whether the troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits military personnel from carrying out domestic law enforcement.",
      "Strong alleged that the federal government acted in violation of that 1878 law, saying troops were used to provide armed security for federal agents, set roadblocks and perimeters that restricted civilian movement, and detained civilians.",
      "California asked U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer for an injunction that would let the military protect federal property \u2014 like courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Justice Department, argued that the military deployment is legal, with the purpose of protecting federal property and personnel. He said that no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act exists.",
      "The federal government's only witness \u2014 Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who was at one point commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he was instructed \"that we were not conducting law enforcement operations and that we were there to serve the United States.\"",
      "\"We took our duty very seriously, and care and professionalism was always exhibited,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump justified the deployment using a law called Title 10, which allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" In an early June memo, Mr. Trump said the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion\" and endangered federal agents.",
      "Breyer had previously ruled that Mr. Trump used Title 10 unlawfully, but he was overruled by an appellate court that said Mr. Trump had discretion to decide if that law applied.",
      "Since then, most of the troops have left Los Angeles, with roughly 300 Guard forces remaining. But the issue has drawn more attention in recent days, as the Trump administration deploys National Guard forces to Washington, D.C.",
      "The administration says that deployment is necessary to support law enforcement and crack down on violent crime, but local leaders have condemned the federal government's intervention.",
      "Strong cautioned that \"Los Angeles is only the beginning,\" citing recent comments from Mr. Trump that she said indicated he may deploy the National Guard to other cities, including Oakland and New York.",
      "A \"constitutional exception?\"",
      "Parts of Tuesday's testimony hinged on an alleged \"constitutional exception\" to the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "At one point, Sherman referred to a \"constitutional exception.\" He testified that he was advised federal troops were allowed to do \"four things\" that would normally be barred under the law \u2014 security patrols, traffic control, crowd control and riot control \u2014 \"because it was in line with what the President was directing\" and \"what the Secretary of Defense was directing.\"",
      "But Judge Breyer was unaware of such an exception and pressed Sherman on the issue.",
      "\"I'm not a lawyer,\" said Sherman.",
      "\"That may be to your credit,\" responded Breyer.",
      "Breyer later asked if Sherman ever received legal advice that if the Guard task force engaged in certain activities, it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Sherman testified that he was told, since Mr. Trump's memo said the Los Angeles protests were a form of rebellion that prevented federal agents from doing their jobs, that triggered the constitutional exception. \"This is all the way from the top of DOD down to Task Force 51,\" he said.",
      "California's attorney, Strong, disputed this \"mysterious constitutional exception,\" arguing that neither the president nor the secretary of defense \"can create an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act.\"",
      "\"That means all the directives we've seen the past two days are wrong and what they told soldiers to do was illegal,\" she said. \"Those directives are based on a constitutional exception that doesn't exist.\"",
      "One exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act, which lets the president use the military to enforce the law during an insurrection. Mr. Trump has not invoked that law.",
      "\"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\"",
      "Mr. Trump's description of the Los Angeles protests as a \"rebellion\" was raised again in court on Tuesday, after Sherman testified Monday that he didn't hear the term used to describe the demonstrations.",
      "Sherman clarified on Tuesday that he knew Mr. Trump's memo called the protests a rebellion.",
      "The judge later pushed back against the idea that Mr. Trump has the discretion to decide if a \"rebellion\" is occurring. \"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\" Breyer asked, repeatedly.",
      "The federal government's attorney, Hamilton, said that the president is commander in chief, and he's entitled to deference in that judgment. But when asked by the judge multiple times, he acknowledged that it doesn't make it a rebellion.",
      "Breyer further questioned Mr. Trump's ability to dictate what the law allows, when Hamilton argued that there was no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act because the military was serving a protective function in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Are you saying that because the president says it, therefore it is?\" said Breyer.",
      "\"If the president says you can do X,\" he continued, \"because the president has said it, that's sufficient to take it out of the Posse Comitatus Act?\"",
      "The trial will conclude on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "Louisville, Kentucky\u00a0\u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced this week the deployment of 800 members of the D.C. National Guard to the District of Columbia, as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "The president is also temporarily taking control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. Hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers have also joined the effort recently, from a variety of agencies fanning out across the city.",
      "\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference Monday.",
      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",

      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News on Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:42:49 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC Director Susan Monarez held an all-hands meeting as staff remain shaken by the shooting rampage targeting the agency's headquarters in Atlanta.",
    "story": [
      "Four days after a gunman riddled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's main campus in Atlanta with bullets, CDC employees say they are still looking for steady leadership and clear communication. The agency's first all-hands meeting since the attack ran roughly 12 minutes, began late and was beset by technical problems, according to staff who tried to watch.",
      "In Tuesday's all-hands, new CDC Director Susan Monarez described the shooting as \"an attack in our community \u2026 and in many ways the very mission that we serve.\" She warned that \"misinformation can be dangerous \u2026 we need to rebuild the trust together,\" urging \"rational, evidence-based discourse \u2026 with compassion and understanding.\"",
      "CDC security chief Jeff Williams told staff investigators view the incident as \"a targeted attack on the CDC related to COVID-19.\" He said agency security \"stopped\" an intrusion that could have resulted in many more casualties, that nearly 100 children at the childcare center were reunited with parents that night, and that investigators recovered nearly 500 shell casings. More than 180 rounds struck six buildings, leaving extensive damage that will take time to repair.",
      "Monarez closed the meeting by honoring fallen DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and pointing staff to a CDC Foundation fund for his family.",
      "In April, more than 200 staff were fired from the CDC's Injury Prevention Center. In the aftermath of Friday's shooting, several CDC employees noted the grim irony: the team charged with studying how to prevent firearm violence had been dismissed.",
      "One employee who spoke with CBS News on background, because they were not authorized to comment publicly, described Monarez's remarks as \"heavily scripted.\" Another staffer said, \"Monarez is new and doesn't know the agency, but she could have brought in career leaders \u2026 to show that she's working hand in hand with experienced CDC leaders. It feels like most of the CDC community is really trying to unify and support each other.\" A union message referred to the meeting, which lasted from 11:12 a.m. to 11:24 a.m., as \"insultingly insufficient,\" and invited workers to a noon healing session.",
      "\"Dr. Monarez and CDC leadership remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News. \"Friday's shooting was a traumatic event for the agency, and leadership is working to provide continued updates along with resources for healing and recovery. There will be continued opportunities for staff engagement and dialogue in the days ahead.\"",
      "Several employees praised separate Saturday and Tuesday calls for the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, led by Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, describing them as \"validating,\" with clear next steps and mental-health resources. Monarez joined the Saturday call and \"was more natural and less scripted,\" a staffer said.",
      "On Tuesday, Daskalakis told staff, \"We've experienced a horrific and intentionally targeted attack \u2026 we're shocked, we're grieving, we're scared,\" and he urged teams to use the space to speak frankly. He emphasized that CDC would take \"time and space before we come back,\" noting the investigation is \"complex and ongoing.\"",
      "The meeting centered on mental health and resources to support traumatized staffers. Daskalakis introduced Dr. David Schonfeld of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, who walked through common post-crisis reactions.",
      "\"Most people try and hide their distress,\" he said, encouraging employees to seek support rather than suppress their feelings. Trying to do so, he added, \"is not a superpower.\"",
      "Daskalakis noted reports that the suspect was angry about COVID-19 vaccines and influenced by conspiracy theories. \"This is not our fault,\" he said. \"Our work is love and what we experienced is hate.\"",
      "Many of the CDC's centers are currently led by acting directors, after several center directors were reassigned to the Indian Health Service earlier this year.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the CDC's campus on Monday, three days after the attack, while most staff were instructed by leadership to telework due to safety concerns and the ongoing assessments following the shootings. On the same day that he visited the CDC, Kennedy gave an interview to Scripps News in which he once again raised questions about vaccine safety, drawing sharp criticism from some CDC staff, who argued that anti-vaccine rhetoric, including from Kennedy, helped create the conditions for the attack.",
      "HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon told CBS News, \"This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff.\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"Violence has no place in any civil society, and the White House extends our heartfelt condolences to the family of Officer David Rose and the entire CDC team.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:57:28 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has installed four U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation, prompting questions about checks on executive power.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in several states have rejected President Trump's controversial picks for top prosecutor posts in a rare standoff between the courts and the White House, but those acting U.S. attorneys will nonetheless remain in place because of actions taken by the president and the Justice Department.",
      "Last month in New York and New Jersey, panels of federal district judges declined to appoint two of Mr. Trump's interim choices to serve as U.S. attorneys \u2013 John Sarcone III of New York and Alina Habba of New Jersey. By law, if the Senate fails to confirm a nominee for a judicial post within 120 days, the District Court can extend the interim appointee or select someone else to serve in an acting capacity until a presidential nominee is confirmed.",
      "In New York, the court declined to extend the interim top prosecutor but also declined to appoint an acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In New Jersey, a panel of judges replaced Habba with Desiree Leigh Grace, the first assistant to the U.S. attorney and the next-highest ranking prosecutor in that office. Within hours, however, the Justice Department fired Grace and installed Habba as acting U.S. attorney, extending her term for another 210 days.",
      "To keep Sarcone in place, Attorney General Pam Bondi named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" effectively giving him the power of a U.S. attorney, and he was named first assistant U.S. attorney, leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "The Trump administration employed similar maneuvers in Nevada and California in late July, this time appointing both interim U.S. attorneys in an acting capacity before the judges were to vote. Those two are Bilal \"Bill\" Essayli in California, and Sigal Chattah in Nevada.",
      "Why some of the acting U.S. attorneys have faced resistance",
      "The clash with the judiciary has come as some legal experts have expressed concern about actions taken by these Trump appointees or by comments they've made.",
      "Essayli, a former assistant U.S. attorney for California, has been accused of politicizing the office by pushing his staff to pursue cases regarded as being aligned with Trump's interests. This has contributed to an exodus from the Los Angeles-based district, Bloomberg Law reported. Essayli is the only one of the four who has prior experience as a prosecutor.",
      "Chattah was in private practice and previously ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in Nevada. Critics have also accused her of using public office to pursue prosecutions of her political opponents and criticized her use of racially charged language in the past.",
      "A group of more than 100 former judges sent a letter to the District Court in Nevada, urging the judicial panel to reject the extension of Chattah's appointment on the grounds of inflammatory remarks she had made in the past. In 2022, she said of her opponent state attorney general's race, Aaron Ford, who is Black, that he should be \"hanging from a f****** crane.\"",
      "Chattah, an Israeli, said the comment was not racist and is just a common Israeli saying. Ford won the election and is still in office as Nevada's attorney general.",
      "Habba was one of Mr. Trump's\u00a0personal lawyers\u00a0before his 2024 election and was initially named White House counselor. As interim U.S. attorney, she initiated investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor and attorney general, on allegations that they were not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Upon being named interim U.S. attorney, Habba said she'd use the office to help \"turn New Jersey red,\" though U.S. attorneys are supposed to remain politically neutral. She also filed and later dropped a criminal trespassing charge against the Newark mayor, a Democrat, and accused Democratic Rep. Monica McIver of felony assault at an immigration protest.",
      "It's not just judges, but also defendants who are challenging Habba's appointment, alleging she holds the office unlawfully. Two individuals being prosecuted by Habba's office have filed motions to dismiss their cases, arguing she illegitimately holds the position.",
      "On Friday, Sarcone's office in the Northern District of New York subpoenaed state Attorney General Letitia James as part of its investigation into whether she and her office violated Mr. Trump's civil rights in the fraud lawsuit she brought against him in 2022. He was found liable of civil fraud in February 2024, months before his re-election. Sarcone served in Mr. Trump's first administration as a regional administrator for the General Services Administration.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's offices in Northern New York, New Jersey, Nevada and California have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Sidestepping the Senate and the Judiciary",
      "Trump's administration isn't the first to exploit the acting official loophole \u2013 several administrations have relied on it in the past. In 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Vanita Gupta as acting head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division amid the department's investigation into the Missouri shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a police officer. As the CATO Institute's Thomas Berry pointed out, Obama never nominated Gupta for the permanent position, but she served well beyond the 210 days allowed by the Vacancies Act. Gupta left office in January 2017, as Mr. Trump was beginning his first term.",
      "The scheme has received more attention from legal experts recently in light of the controversial nature of the four attorneys and the administration's overt push to sidestep the Senate and the judiciary.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Mr. Trump and Bondi have built a \"fantastic team\" of prosecutors with full departmental support. The spokesperson declined to comment on why the department chose to use the Vacancies Act to temporarily appoint the individuals, rather than sending them through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "The Justice Department's use of the maneuver has raised the ire of several legal experts, who said they were concerned by the administration's moves to sidestep judicial authority.",
      "Michael Luttig, a former federal judge who signed onto the letter urging the rejection of Chattah's appointment, told CBS News that Mr. Trump's efforts to install U.S. attorneys without the Senate's approval are a part of a larger assault on the justice system and the rule of law.",
      "\"Every action that he's taken has been intended to harass, intimidate and threaten the federal judiciary into submission to his will,\" Luttig said.",
      "U.S. attorneys and the Vacancies Act",
      "Across the country, 93 U.S. attorneys lead the federal prosecutor's office in their judicial district. Each presidential appointee must be confirmed by the Senate to serve on a permanent basis. Confirmation can be a lengthy process, so, under the Vacancies Act, the president can temporarily appoint an individual to fill Senate-confirmed roles on an interim basis to allow agencies and offices to continue to function.",
      "The act enables the president to appoint an interim U.S. attorney to any of those positions for 120 days. If the Senate hasn't confirmed a nominee by the end of that period, judges in the corresponding federal district court may extend the interim appointee or install a candidate they choose as acting U.S. attorney for another 210 days.",
      "\"My understanding is that under prior administrations, there would be some behind-the-scenes communication to make sure that the interim U.S. attorney picked by the administration was acceptable to the District Court,\" Berry told CBS News.",
      "For three of the four contested nominees, Mr. Trump did not submit a nomination for the post to the Senate within the 120-day interim period. He nominated Habba to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey on June 30 but withdrew her nomination when it became evident that the Senate would not confirm her.",
      "In addition to Habba's rejection by the judges, also standing in the way of her ability to stay on in the office was her nomination. Under the Vacancies Act, a person may not serve as an acting officer if the president has submitted that individual's nomination to the Senate.",
      "Withdrawing Habba's nomination meant Mr. Trump could fire Grace and appoint Habba to replace her as first assistant, allowing her to assume the acting title.",
      "In New York, Sarcone reached the end of his 120-day term without a nomination pending before the Senate. When his term expired, the District Court declined to extend Sarcone, and didn't appoint anyone to the position. The Justice Department says its appointment of Sarcone as \"special attorney to the attorney general\" would confer him with the authority of a U.S. attorney and is \"indefinite.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, six of Mr. Trump's 49 interim U.S. attorneys have served the maximum 120 days allowed under that status. Andrew Boutros of the Northern District of Illinois and Joseph Murphy of the Western District of Tennessee, have also seen their interim appointments expire.",
      "In their cases, though, the District Courts voted to extend them on the 120th day, a person familiar with the decisions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It's not clear whether the Trump administration will continue to use the maneuver to appoint other U.S. attorneys. Mr. Trump has named at least 45 interim U.S. attorneys since January and has submitted nominations to the Senate for at least 30 of those picks.",
      "In early August, the Senate approved the first two of Mr. Trump's nominees for U.S. attorneys: Jeanine Pirro to serve in the District of Columbia and Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that the Trump administration is \"abusing\" the interim appointment authority to install loyalist interim U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation.",

    "story": [
      "The State Department on Tuesday released a long-awaited series of reports on worldwide human rights practices that reveal scaled-back criticism of select countries including El Salvador and harsher assessments of traditional U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom and Germany.",
      "The release follows a period of revisions that administration officials said were meant to \"streamline\" the reports, which cover events in about 200 countries in 2024 and had been largely completed by the end of the Biden administration. A note included with the reports said they had been \"adjusted\" to be \"aligned to the administration's executive orders.\"",
      "The 2024 reports omit references to LGBTQ discrimination issues and significantly pare back treatments of issues including gender-based violence and government corruption. They no longer include sections dedicated to systemic racial or ethnic discrimination or violence, or to child abuse or child sexual exploitation, among other deletions.",
      "Mandated by Congress, the reports have been produced annually by the State Department for decades and are used by U.S. policymakers, human rights workers, foreign governments and judicial bodies worldwide as a resource to inform potential arms sales and court proceedings, and they also function as a U.S.-led check on government corruption and abuses.",
      "Rights groups and former State Department officials decried the revisions as an \"erasure\" of the plight of marginalized communities and what they said was a politically motivated move that undermined the prior value of the reports.",
      "\"I think the signals are quite loud and quite clear of who they value and who they don't,\" said Desir\u00e9e Cormier Smith, former special representative for racial equity and justice, now with the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice.",
      "In the case of El Salvador, which ended presidential term limits in early August and has an agreement with the Trump administration to accept and detain undocumented immigrants from the U.S., the report notes \"There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\" and that the government had taken \"credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.\"",
      "The 2023 report made note of El Salvador's overcrowded prisons and reports of \"arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention,\" and more.",
      "This year's report for Hungary notes \"no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\" though last year's included extensive mention of \"serious government corruption\" and restrictions on media freedom.",
      "Meanwhile the 2024 report for the United Kingdom notes the \"human rights situation worsened,\" citing \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\" A similar assessment was offered for Germany and France, countries administration officials including Vice President JD Vance have publicly accused of censorship and the suppression of free speech.",
      "Asked by a reporter how the Trump administration squares its stricter monitoring of free expression via social media accounts of U.S. visa applicants with its criticism of European countries restricting hate speech, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a press briefing Tuesday that \"restrictive laws against dis-favored voices, often on political or religious grounds \u2014 no matter how disagreeable someone's speech may be \u2014 to criminalize it, or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression, and polarization.\"",
      "The 2024 report for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza does not include a death toll for Israelis or Palestinians since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, a figure that was included in 2023.",
      "The report acknowledged a Committee to Protect Journalists figure of 82 Palestinian journalists having been killed in the conflict last year, but also included a line saying that \"[i]n some cases, the IDF claimed the journalists killed were embedded with Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "The report did acknowledge troubling human rights records in several countries with which it has struck agreements to deport third national nationals, such as Libya. It noted credible reports of \"arbitrary or unlawful killings; disappearances; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest and detention\" and other abuses.",
      "It also noted of Afghanistan that there was \"widespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those responsible for human rights abuses.\" The U.S. terminated temporary protected status for Afghans last month, leaving more than 12,000 vulnerable to deportation.",
      "Reports for Russia, China, North Korea and Iran noted this year, as they did in previous years, \"significant\" human rights issues and included criticism of inaction by their respective governments to identify or punish those who had committed abuses.",
      "\"The 2024 human rights report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancies, increases report readability and is more responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report,\" a senior State Department official said in a briefing last week. \"U.S. policy on promoting respect for human rights around the globe, or in any particular country, has not changed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Tuesday signed new legislation requiring more thorough background checks before hiring police officers, a law inspired by the shooting death of Sonya Massey.",
      "Massey was shot and killed by former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy Sean Grayson in July 2024 inside her home near Springfield.",
      "Grayson has been fired and\u00a0charged with first-degree murder in Massey's killing, and questions have been raised about why he was hired in the first place, given concerns about his conduct at past police jobs.",
      "Grayson\u00a0shot and killed Massey\u00a0as she was checking on a pot of boiling water in her kitchen while saying \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" but prosecutors have said Grayson asked her to move the pot off the stove, and that she never posed a danger that justified the use of lethal force.",
      "Earlier this year, the Illinois House and Illinois Senate overwhelmingly passed the Sonya Massey Act with bipartisan support. The legislation would require more comprehensive background checks before hiring police or other law enforcement officers in Illinois.",
      "Pritzker said Tuesday that he signed the measure \"to help prevent these tragedies, to better equip law enforcement to keep our communities safe, and to continue working to build a justice system that protects all of our citizens.\"",
      "The new law requires local, county, and state law enforcement agencies statewide to conduct full background checks on a potential hire before offering them a badge and gun.",
      "The measure also prohibits law enforcement agencies from making a final job offer unless they've reviewed all of an applicant's prior employment records.",
      "Anyone applying for a police officer job in Illinois would be required to authorize all previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies, to provide full employment records \u2013 including \"duty-related physical and psychological fitness-for-duty examinations; work performance records,\" and any criminal records or records of other investigations connected to their conduct on the job.",
      "\"Officers with histories of serious disciplinary issues should not be serving in those capacities in our communities, and those histories should not come to light only after disaster happens,\" Pritzker said. \"Our justice system needs to be built on trust. Communities should be able to trust that when they call the police to their home, the responding officer will be well-trained and without a history bias or misconduct. And police officers should be able to trust that they are serving alongside responsible and capable individuals.\"",
      "Massey's family has said they hope this new law will become a model for other states.",
      "\"Thank you for your support and God bless you,\" her mother, Donna Massey, said after the governor signed the legislation.",
      "Before Grayson was hired in Sangamon County and went on to kill Massey,\u00a0questions about his conduct\u00a0were well-documented by other police agencies. But those concerns were somehow never shared with the Sangamon County Sheriff's office during the hiring process.",
      "In his fifth police job, he refused to terminate a high-speed chase and drove more than 110 mph \u2014 only coming to an end when he hit a deer. A report from a department where Grayson was employed also said he struggled with report writing and was aggressive in his pursuit for drugs.",
      "Grayson is\u00a0scheduled to go on trial for Massey's death in October\u00a0in Peoria County. The Illinois Supreme Court is\u00a0weighing a request from Grayson to be released from jail ahead of his murder trial.",

      "The review was announced in a letter Tuesday to Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Lonnie Bunch, signed by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and two other White House aides. It comes after President Trump signed an executive order in March pushing for changes at the Smithsonian, including the removal of \"improper ideology.\"",
      "The review is timed with next year's celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the letter said.",
      "\"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" the White House's letter read.",

      "Within 120 days, the White House said museums should start making \"content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.\"",
      "The Smithsonian said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Smithsonian's work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.\"",
      "The letter called the review a \"collaborative\" effort that \"empowers museum staff.\"",
      "\"Our goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America's heritage,\" the White House wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to reshape the Smithsonian and other U.S. cultural institutions during his second term to combat what he sees as ideological bias \u2014 assuming a more active role than prior presidents.",
      "His March executive order directed Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents \u2014 to work to review Smithsonian museums, including by \"seeking to remove improper ideology.\" It claimed some of the institution's museums have \"promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\"",
      "The order drew condemnation from Democrats. The four Democratic members of the House Administration Committee penned an open letter calling the moves \"cowardly and unpatriotic\" and saying Mr. Trump's order would undermine the Smithsonian's independence.",

      "Late last month, the Washington Post reported that the National Museum of American History had removed references to Mr. Trump's two impeachments. The Smithsonian later said it would update the exhibit to reflect all impeachment proceedings in U.S. history, calling the placard that was removed \"temporary\" and saying it \"did not meet the museum's standards.\" The Smithsonian said it wasn't asked by the Trump administration to remove anything.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would fire the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in May, calling her a \"highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI.\" The Smithsonian later put out a statement noting its independence and asserting that only Bunch \u2014 who has served as secretary of the Smithsonian since 2019 \u2014 can make personnel decisions. The director later resigned, the New York Times and Washington Post reported.",

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",

    "summary": "Three officials involved in President Trump's controversial L.A. National Guard deployment testified in court Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Three officials involved in President Trump's controversial deployment of National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles testified Monday as the trial in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration began.",
      "The question at issue is whether the military forces sent in by Mr. Trump \u2014 including members of the Marine Corps and National Guard \u2014 violated the 19th century Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from enforcing domestic laws.",
      "Newsom called the deployment of around 4,000 California National Guard troops, who normally are under the governor's command, an illegal \"power grab.\" But Mr. Trump argued the move was legal and necessary to protect immigration agents and federal property during tense protests against operations by ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump's early June executive order calling up the Guard said the protests \"constitute a form of rebellion.\" And the administration has justified the deployment using a law called Title 10 that allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion\" or \"invasion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "In one notable moment during Monday's testimony, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman \u2014 who at one point was deployed as the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he never heard the term \"rebellion\" used to describe the situation in the nation's second-largest city.",
      "San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer is overseeing the three-day trial. Breyer had previously ruled in June that Mr. Trump's deployment was likely illegal. An appellate court overturned that ruling, saying the president should be given deference to decide whether Title 10 applies, and that Mr. Trump had some basis to say that violence during the protests had prevented federal officers from enforcing the law. The appellate judges didn't weigh in on whether the protests constituted a rebellion, which they said wasn't necessary for the deployment to be legal.",
      "The dispute gained new resonance on Monday, after Mr. Trump announced National Guard forces would be deployed in Washington, D.C., to assist with police. Unlike in California, the D.C. National Guard reports to the president.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Guard forces will not be involved in law enforcement in the nation's capital, but they can briefly detain people if necessary and hand them over to police.",
      "Officials testify about military's role amid L.A. protests",
      "Military officials said their mission was to protect federal facilities and federal personnel, and \"to support federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Sherman testified that the military could be sent whenever local law enforcement carried out an operation, even if there were no physical threats and no protesters were breaking the law.",
      "The comments surprised Breyer, who pressed him on the claim, asking: \"So if there's no threat you can send out the military?\" Sherman affirmed that whenever local law enforcement was carrying out an operation, the military could be sent out, explaining that a threat could develop even if no active threat was assessed.",
      "\"Wouldn't that always be the case?\" Breyer responded.",
      "But Sherman said he had withheld support for one operation. He testified that a DHS official questioned his \"loyalty\" to his country for objecting to the request for military assistance with an immigration enforcement operation at MacArthur Park. He said he had assessed that there was a low risk to federal agents on that occasion.",
      "The operation, which took place on July 7, featured horse-mounted officers and military Humvees and drew national attention.",
      "William Harrington, deputy chief of staff for the Los Angeles military deployment's task force, testified that he understood the federalized National Guard troops could not engage in civil enforcement activities, and everybody knew the Posse Comitatus Act applied. He said task force members responded to requests for assistance from federal law enforcement agencies. These included protecting federal buildings and force protection for federal agents who were executing functions such as search warrant operations.",
      "Ernesto Santacruz Jr., a field office director for the Department of Homeland Security, testified Monday that assaults on agents from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division reduced drastically once the National Guard was there. He said that there had been daily attacks on officers before the deployment.",
      "Santacruz testified that the National Guard troops were there \"to assist and protect federal authorities.\" He did not know of any denials of requests for assistance.",
      "When asked about the law this trial centers on, the Posse Comitatus Act, Santacruz did not have any knowledge of what it allowed or prohibited.",
      "At its peak in June, nearly 5,000 service members were deployed to the Los Angeles area: some 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. The vast majority of Guard forces have been returned to California, though about 300 remain under federal control.",
      "As of Sunday night, the remaining Guard forces were still guarding a courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles and a facility in Paramount, California, Sherman testified.",
      "The trial will continue on Tuesday, when the federal government will call Sherman back to the stand. On Wednesday, the court is set to hear several legal issues raised by the government, including that California lacks standing to sue."

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have opened a new front in their efforts to crack down on abortion, this time with a bill that would enable lawsuits targeting the use of medication to terminate pregnancies. Their proposal would also take aim at shield laws in other states that protect manufacturers and the doctors who prescribe abortion pills.",
      "In Texas, it is already illegal to knowingly mail, carry or deliver abortion-inducing drugs. It is also illegal for a doctor not licensed in the state of Texas to prescribe abortion medication.",
      "Now, in the midst of an already controversial special legislative session, lawmakers have reintroduced a bill that would allow lawsuits to target anyone who manufactures, mails, delivers, prescribes or distributes abortion pills. The bill would also permit people to file a wrongful death lawsuit if the medication results in harm or death of a fetus or the mother, within a statute of limitations up to six years.",
      "\"These are the pills that are being mailed into Texas directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without follow-up care after,\" the bill's sponsor, Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican, told the Texas Tribune earlier this year. \"This is illegal in Texas, but is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.\"",
      "The World Health Organization says the pills \u2014 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 can be safely prescribed for women to self-administer at home, without the direct supervision of a health care provider, in the first trimester.",
      "Hughes previously sponsored a state law, passed in 2021, banning abortions at six weeks, or when a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected.",
      "The new proposal, known as the Women and Child Protection Act, is expected to be heard in committee in the Texas State Senate during Monday's special session. An earlier version stalled in the House during the most recent legislative session.",
      "The bill also seeks to route any challenges into federal court, and includes language aimed at neutralizing the force of so-called shield laws in other states, designed to protect doctors who prescribe abortion medication from states without bans.",
      "\"Texas continues to try to meddle in the provision of safe, legal and affordable reproductive health care nationwide,\" says Julie Kay, the former executive director for the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. \"Telemedicine abortion is a modern and effective way to provide care.\"",
      "At the same time, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, who led the push for the state's current abortion restrictions, has announced a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Texas woman who alleges the father of the child she was expecting slipped abortion medication into her hot chocolate, leading her to lose her pregnancy.",
      "Similar to the proposed legislation, this lawsuit targets shield laws in other states meant to protect physicians who provided the abortion pills in the plaintiff's case. The lawsuit is filed in federal court and names a nonprofit group that the plaintiff claims helped the father obtain medication, Aid Access, which is based in the Netherlands.",
      "According to the civil lawsuit, the father \"obtained these drugs from Aid Access, a criminal organization that illegally ships abortion pills into Texas and other jurisdictions where abortion has been outlawed.\"",
      "Aid Access and the father have not been criminally charged.",
      "On its website, Aid Access says it has facilitated over 200,000 online abortions to women in the U.S. since 2018. In some cases, the group relies on telemedicine shield laws, such as ones enacted in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington, to fulfill orders and mail them to recipients in states with bans.",
      "Aid Access founder Dr. Rebecca Gomperts previously told CBS News the service is legal in all the jurisdictions in which it operates.",
      "\"Where I work from, it's legal to prescribe the medications. And so I'll do that. And the pharmacy that I refer to is allowed to mail the medicines, on a prescription of a doctor, to the women. So (the Texas law) has no impact on what we do,\" Gomperts said.",

      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "The Perseids meteor shower \u2014 considered one of the best shows in the sky \u2014 is set to peak this week. But the peak for fireballs shooting through the night sky coincides this year with a bright moon that is expected to negatively impact visibility for eager viewers.",
      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",
      "The Perseids \"are an incredible meteor shower,\" Thaddeus LaCoursiere, of the Bell Museum, told The Associated Press.",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",

      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",

    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

    "summary": "Astronaut Jim Lovell circled the moon on Apollo 8 and helped bring Apollo 13 home safely despite a mishap far from Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the famous Apollo 13 mission, has died, NASA announced Friday. He was 97.",
      "Apollo 13, a 1970 flight to the moon, became known as a \"successful failure\" after the spacecraft experienced an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth but managed to safely return home.",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement that Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois. Duffy praised Lovell's life and work, saying he inspired millions of people.",
      "\"Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\" Duffy said.",
      "Lovell was the command module pilot for 1968's Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back, though it did not land on the lunar surface.",
      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",
      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "\"We've been very pensive over the last days of understanding what we have all got to be a part of. We know that there are some tumultuous times on Earth ... and we want this mission, our mission, to be a reminder of what people can do when we work together, when we explore together.\"",
      "Station commander Onishi then handed a symbolic key to the lab complex \u2014 along with command of the ISS \u2014 to cosmonaut Sergey Ryzhikov.",

      "\"We are going to celebrate the 25th anniversary of International Space Station flight in manned mode (in November),\" he continued. \"History shows that on our beautiful planet, people unfortunately cannot understand each other. But in space we can cooperate effectively. So thank you everybody.\"",
      "Crew 10's departure comes six days after the arrival of their replacements, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They were launched Aug. 1 aboard the Crew Dragon Endeavour.",
      "Since then, the outgoing crew, along with Ryzhikov, cosmonaut Alexey  Zubritsky and NASA crewmate Jonny Kim, has been briefing the replacements on the intricacies of station operations, getting them up to  speed as quickly as possible.",
      "As it turned out, Crew 10 enjoyed a bit of additional time for a \"handover\" thanks to high winds in the splashdown zone that ruled out a planned Wednesday undocking.",
      "The undocking Friday set up a 17.5-hour trip back to Earth. The Crew Dragon's forward-facing Draco thrusters will fire for nearly 10 minutes at 10:39 a.m. EDT Saturday, slowing the capsule enough to drop the far side of the ship's orbit into the atmosphere.",
      "Following a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, Endurance is expected to splash down off Southern California at 11:33 a.m., closing out a 147-day, 16-hour, 29-minute mission spanning 2,368 orbits and 62.8 million miles since it launched on March 14.",

      "The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the best picture yet of a high-speed comet visiting our solar system from another star.",
      "NASA and the European Space Agency released the latest photos Thursday.",
      "Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth.",
      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",
      "Los Cumbres Observatory created an animation of image data from its telescope as it tracked the new interstellar on July 4, 2025:",
      "As scientists watch the object, some are raising questions. Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who is the director of the institute for theory and computation at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says it could actually be alien technology. He said many of its characteristics are not typical, and that its trajectory is \"fine-tuned.\"",
      "\"The object looks strange. It reflects a lot of sunlight,\" he told \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"Moreover, this object has some glow in front of it, not behind it. There is no tail, as usually is the case for comets.\"",
      "He advises the best way to proceed is to collect as much scientific data as possible.",
      "\"Not assuming anything, just monitoring it and deciding whether it maneuvers, whether it has some artificial lights, whether it looks like a technological object, and if it ends up being a comet, so be it,\" he said.",

      "Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan beat the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane in a flight that took him soaring to 9,521 meters, or 31,237 feet, his team announced Wednesday.",
      "The SolarStratos plane made the landmark flight from Sion airport in southwest Switzerland on Tuesday, taking advantage of warm air thermals to go beyond the record that has stood for 15 years.",
      "The certified altitude record for a solar plane stands at 9,235 meters, or 30,298 feet.",
      "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
      "At cruising altitude, Domjan actually crossed paths with a commercial airliner, SolarStratos said, calling the moment \"a powerful symbol of what the decarbonized aviation of tomorrow might look like.\"",
      "Domjan's flight lasted five hours and nine minutes.",
      "\"I share this moment of joy with all the people who have been preparing for this achievement for years,\" the 53-year-old said.",
      "The data will be sent to the World Air Sports Federation governing body, which will decide whether to validate the new record.",
      "\"It is the pressure altitude corrected to standard density altitude that is recognized as the official reference for aviation altitude records,\" the SolarStratos team said.",
      "Domjan \u2014 whose company bio describes him as a \"eco-adventurer\" and lecturer who pilots planes, gliders and helicopters \u2014 is aiming to be the first to take a solar-powered plane above 10,000 meters, flying at the same altitude as airliners. If that barrier is broken, the team hopes to go on and make a first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, which at Switzerland's latitude begins at around 12,000 meters.",
      "\"This achievement marks a major milestone on the path toward reaching the stratosphere using only solar power -- and already fulfils the mission's goal: to capture imaginations with emblematic, spectacular challenges that promote solar energy and the protection of our biosphere and planet,\" SolarStratos said.",
      "The front-mounted single propeller plane, registration HB-SXA, is made of carbon fiber to ensure lightness and strength. SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",
      "\"It's important to demonstrate what we can achieve with solar energy,\" the adventurer told AFP.",
      "\"The dream of flight is probably the oldest dream of mankind,\" he said.",

      "\"This is what we want to achieve: it's really to show that the world of tomorrow can be better than what we have today,\" he added.",
      "A warm-up flight on July 31 got to 6,589 meters, surpassing the plane's previous best in 2024.",
      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",
      "Before takeoff, the batteries must be fully charged using solar energy, and the plane has to land under its own power \u2014 it cannot glide back in on zero charge \u2014 and have at least 16% charge in the batteries.",
      "If the flight is to be certified as a record, all the energy used during the flight must have been produced by the solar cells. The current record was set in 2010 by the Solar Impulse experimental plane, with Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg at the controls.",

    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",

      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",

      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",

      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",

      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical.

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abigail-spanberger-virginia-latino-voters-ad/",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:05:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is trying to win over Latino voters in her bid to be the next governor of Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is working to make inroads with Latino voters ahead of the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, releasing her first Spanish-language radio ad on Thursday.",
      "The former congresswoman addresses rising costs, telling voters in Spanish, \"I know what it's like for families today. I got things done to lower costs. That's what I'll do as governor, too.\"",
      "Democrats across the country are working to regain the Latino support the party lost in the 2024 elections. President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election, outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters, and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier.",
      "But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better, compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026, 29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods.",
      "A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's \"meeting Latino Virginians where they are \u2014 on the ground and in-language \u2014 and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families, keeping communities safe, and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.\"",
      "Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population, according to the Census Bureau, and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart.",
      "\"We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican,\" Rocha said. \"She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better, and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now.\"",
      "Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs, housing and energy, as governor.",
      "Her ad also takes aim at her opponent, GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education.",
      "\"Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care, too,\" the ad says. \"We need a governor who fights for Virginia, not Trump.\"",
      "Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday, her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger, who represented Virginia in Congress for six years, as a \"Washington insider.\"",
      "She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad, saying that the former congresswoman \"voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time.\"",
      "\"That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards,\" Earle-Sears says in the ad. \"Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.\"",
      "Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration, since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June, Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: \"This November, Virginia gets to be the first to the polls, along with our friends up in New Jersey, to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.\""

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:32:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",

Dating back to the 16th century, the document describes an early payment structure established by the Spanish military commander who conquered parts of modern-day Latin America, according to the FBI.",
      "\"This is an original manuscript page that was actually signed by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s on February 20, 1527,\" said FBI special agent Jessica Dittmer, a member of the bureau's art crime team, in a statement. The page \"outlines the payment of pesos of common gold for expenses in preparation for discovery of the spice lands, so it really gives a lot of flavor as to the planning and preparation for unchartered territory back then,\" Dittmer said.",

Gavin Newsom's lawsuit and whether the Posse Comitatus Act \u2014 which generally bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement \u2014 applied to the troop deployment.",
      "Mr. Trump in June deployed 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, saying they were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement agents amid June protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. Newsom did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and responded with a lawsuit\u00a0requesting an injunction limiting the military's role in the city.",
      "In addition to claiming the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, argued that there is no precedent for the lawsuit, for injunctive relief or money damages under the act, and that Newsom and the state of California have not suffered the harm required to sue.",
      "\"It is, in fact, the federal government who is engaged in unprecedented conduct,\" said Deputy Attorney General Meghan Strong, representing the State of California, explaining that the government has never used the military in this way before.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer seemed perplexed by several of the government's assertions, particularly what he called the apparent \"absence of any limits to a national police force.\" He questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 19th century law at the center of this trial is not relevant, and the assertion that his court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the president.",
      "\"So then what is the remedy?\" Breyer asked Hamilton, raising the issue of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. \"You're saying there's a criminal remedy? The president can be prosecuted? You say that in light of the Supreme Court decision, the Trump decision. Isn't he immune?\"",
      "\"So that's it. Too bad. So sad. It's over,\" he added emphatically. \"And that's the end of the case.\"",
      "California has asked Breyer for an injunction that would allow the military to protect federal property \u2014 such as courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "\"The constitution and the law and the facts are on Governor Newsom's side,\" said Josh Kastenberg, a professor at the University of New Mexico Law School. \"But that doesn't mean he's going to win. Ever since World War II, the courts have embraced this military deference doctrine, which really is presidential deference in matters of military command and control.\"",
      "Questions over scope",
      "\"We're going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines that there's some threat to the safety of a federal agent,\" Breyer said to Hamilton. \"And it's his determination. Not mine, it's his. That's what you're saying. That's what the law is.\"",
      "Hamilton said that wasn't \"quite what I'm saying.\" He asserted the troops are not enforcing federal law, but providing protection, and that it is lawful for guardsmen and marines to provide protection for federal buildings \u2014 the one point he agreed with California's attorney on. But, he argued, there is no distinction between protecting federal property and protecting federal law enforcement working out in the field.",
      "Breyer pointed out that federal employees \"are everywhere.\"",
      "The judge further questioned why any National Guard members remain in Los Angeles, and expressed concern about the justification for continued operations. Hamilton testified that 300 guardsmen remain, a 90% reduction in the force. Strong countered that it is still a significant number of soldiers, and certainly enough to violate the law.",
      "\"Thank goodness for the National Guard, but why is the federalized National Guard still in place?\" asked Breyer. \"What's the threat today? What was the threat yesterday?\"",
      "\"I go back to the thing that I'm really troubled by: What limiting factors are there to the use of this force?\" he said, \"Once you have a force in place, and maybe legitimately do so, and the threat that gave rise to the force in that place subsides \u2026 how does one look at this national police force that goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws?\"",
      "Does the Posse Comitatus Act apply?",
      "Breyer appeared to take issue with the Justice Department's argument that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, noting that a key witness, Major General Scott Sherman \u2014 who was at one point the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 had testified that the troops were trained to act within the bounds of that law.",
      "\"Then why is it the excellent Major General sought assurance that the Posse Comitatus Act was followed?\" said Breyer. \"Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide, and regulation after regulation, and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act if the Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant?\"",
      "Strong argued that all of the Department of Defense's leaders agreed that the Posse Comitatus Act applied to the Task Force 51 troops in Los Angeles. She said they substituted the word \"protection\" for \"security\" when describing the troops' activities because they knew that \"security\" would violate the act.",
      "She asserted that the secretary of defense had released a memorandum invoking a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, and affirmatively instructing soldiers to engage in activities that violated it \u2014 but the memo was issued after those activities had taken place.",
      "On Tuesday, Sherman testified that he was advised of a \"constitutional exception\" that enabled the troops to conduct certain activities that would normally violate the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "Strong called this an attempt by the Department of Defense to justify their actions after the fact that \"itself reveals a knowledge and awareness of their violations.\"",
      "The federal government is \"disregarding the law, and so we need show nothing more than that,\" said Strong.",
      "She further argued that the Constitution seeks to make sure the president cannot control a standing army the way the king had in 1776. She said that it would deny the basic principles of federalism for the state to have \"no legal recourse to challenge the conduct of these troops.\"",
      "\"If you look at the plain language of the Posse Comitatus Act, and the fear of standing armies that existed at the time of the Constitution,\" Kastenberg said. \"... One of the biggest issues in the state conventions and in the framing of the Constitution to begin with was to significantly curtail the president's authority over the standing army, and keep the standing army very small.\"",
      "Breyer did not give a timeline for his ruling, stating at the end of the day, \"I will decide the case as soon as I can decide the case.\"",

    "summary": "The National Park Service warned that feeding bears can cause serious consequences including the \"euthanasia of the animal.\"",
    "story": [
      "The National Park Service is warning visitors not to feed black bears, saying that giving the animals food could lead to serious consequences for the animal and large fines.",
      "\"Feeding bears is not only illegal; it can be extremely dangerous for bears and visitors,\" the Great Smoky Mountains National Park wrote in the warning.",
      "The park reported an increase in incidents where tourists intentional fed bears, including three separate occurrences in just one week. In one case, a visitor fed a mother bear and her two cubs and was issued a citation.",
      "Intentionally feeding wildlife in the park is a federal offense and can result in fines of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to six months, park officials said. Any park visitor who sees someone intentionally feeding a bear should inform park authorities, the NPS said.",
      "\"Bears learn quickly\" and are endangered by intentional feeding, the park said. If a bear is fed by a person even once, that can lead to the animal becoming \"conditioned to human food,\" the park said. This can result in the bear seeking out people and exhibiting more aggressive behavior while losing its natural fear of humans, putting both park visitors and bears at risk. Bears seeking out human food are also more likely to be hit by a car, the park said.",
      "\"In some cases, feeding a bear can result in the euthanasia of the animal,\" the park said. Officials in Yellowstone National Park had to trap and kill an 11-year-old male grizzly bear in May after the animal became conditioned to human food. The bear began overturning bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans to access human food, the park said.",
      "The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is home to about 1,900 American black bears, according to the NPS. Bear activity is high in the area between May and August because the animal's breeding season is putting a stress on natural food sources. Eighteen-month-old yearlings are also being left by their mothers and learning how to navigate on their own for the first time. These younger bears are more likely to wander into areas where humans are, the park said.",
      "About 339 \"negative human-bear encounters\" are reported annually in the park, the NPS said. Many more incidents go unreported. While black bears are not normally aggressive, they will defend food and cubs. They may fight back if cornered, and may attack dogs, the NPS said. Dogs are involved in the majority of physical encounters between people and bears, the agency said.",
      "Visitors to national parks should never feed or approach bears. Coming within 150 feet of the animals can result in fines and arrest, the park said. All food and trash should be stored securely and disposed of in bear-resistant containers. Visitors should also stay alert while in the park, and report unusual bear behavior to park authorities.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 07:23:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Texas hurtles toward a flashpoint on a GOP effort to redraw congressional districts, California Democrats are about to answer with a plan of their own.",
    "story": [
      "California Democrats are preparing to counter Republicans' attempt to reshape a series of Texas congressional districts for political advantage in a back and forth that could define next year's midterm elections and with it, the final two years of President Trump's second term.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office has announced plans for a major state announcement Thursday as national tensions rage over changing congressional lines mid-decade. Districts are usually redrawn after the decennial census. Newsom has vowed his state would respond after Texas Republicans released plans earlier this summer to redraw five seats held by Democrats and make them more favorable to the GOP.",
      "\"If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states,\" Mr. Newsom said in a recent letter to the president.",
      "Newsom's team participated in a series of conversations with the state's Democratic congressional delegation and the California Legislature as drafts of possible maps were discussed. According to U.S. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the conversations were initially centered on the question, \"Is this even conceptually possible?\"",
      "California Democrats concluded that it was possible to gain five Democratic seats to counter Texas' gains, according to Lofgren. \"I'm confident that if we need to move forward, we will do that successfully. There's tremendous unity on the Democratic side.\"",
      "Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and hold the White House. At the moment, if Democrats were to win back as few as three seats in next year's midterms, they could flip control of the House. That path would be threatened however if Republicans and Mr. Trump succeed in convincing GOP-led states like Texas, Indiana and Missouri to take some of their Democratic-held districts and alter them to favor Republicans instead.",
      "The potential developments in California Thursday come as Texas Republicans struggle to pass the maps that have become a national issue. Breakaway state House Democrats fled Texas earlier this month, denying the chamber the quorum it needed to take action on the new maps during a special legislative session.",
      "Since then, national Democrats have sought to call attention to what Republicans are trying to do in Texas, even as it's opened the left up to accusations of hypocrisy. During the standoff, some Texas Democrats have spoken out from Illinois, a blue state that was criticized for drawing its congressional maps after the 2020 Census to give Democrats the advantage.",
      "For both sides, the issue of congressional districts has become even more starkly partisan this summer. Various attempts have also been made in court to bring state House Democrats back to Texas, or to create a path that will help Republicans get their way.",
      "During a floor speech \u2014 before the maps passed the Texas Senate earlier this week in what amounted to a moot effort, given the House's obstacles \u2014 Republican Phil King bluntly said an objective of his \"was to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "With the special session in Texas set to end in just a few days, Republicans have been adamant about eventually passing the maps, even if it takes more time and special sessions. With Democratic power limited in the state, there is a sense that Republicans will eventually be able to get their way.",
      "But the situation has left an opening for Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to create a new front in the political fight, given that Democrats may have a path to redrawing Republican-held congressional districts in the blue state of California.",
      "But California's effort will likely prove to be far more difficult and time intensive than the Republican-led push in Texas.",
      "In California, only nine of the state's 52 U.S. House districts are held by Republicans. Earlier this century, voters in the state signed off on putting in the state's constitution an independent citizens redistricting commission to decide new boundaries following the once a decade census process.",
      "The state-level differences between Democrat-led California and Republican-led-Texas essentially makes it harder for California Democrats to redraw districts in their state than it currently is for Texas Republicans. In Texas, GOP leaders and Mr. Trump allies just need to go through the normal legislative process to change districts.",
      "Because of California's constitution, changing the redistricting process in the state ahead of the 2026 midterms would likely require a new amendment. To take effect, it would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election. That election could prove costly, with major implications for the country on the line.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The Legislature will have five days to conduct public hearings and formalize the process.",

    "story": [
      "A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \"Frankenstein bunnies,\" \"demon rabbits\" and \"zombie rabbits.\" But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",
      "\"It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth,\" Susan Mansfield, a Fort Collins resident who saw one of the rabbits, told 9News. \"I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn't. He came back a second year, and it grew.\"",
      "Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.",
      "But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.",
      "Rabbit papilloma is similar to human HPV-induced tumors, according to an article in the\u00a0National Library of Medicine, and human papillomavirus has been linked to skin cancer, according to a recent report.",
      "The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.",
      "The agency notes that the disease is more severe in domestic rabbits than in wild rabbits and should be treated by a veterinarian.",
      "Colorado is home to three different species of cottontail rabbits -- the mountain cottontail, the desert cottontail and the eastern cottontail. The species differ mostly by color and are \"difficult or impossible to distinguish in the field, except by habitat and geographic location,\" \u00a0Colorado Parks and Wildlife says.",

      "A jury in Salt Lake County found Nicholas Rossi guilty of a 2008 rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents took the stand. The verdict came hours after Rossi, 38, declined to testify on his own behalf. He will be sentenced in the case on Oct. 20 and is set to stand trial in September for another rape charge in Utah County.",
      "First-degree felony rape carries a punishment in Utah of five years to life in prison, said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill.",

It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit in 2018. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when the state made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in Utah County, an online obituary claimed Rossi had died on Feb. 29, 2020, of late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead. He was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19 after hospital staff in Glasgow recognized his distinctive tattoos from an Interpol notice.",

      "He appeared in court this week in a wheelchair, wearing a suit and tie and using an oxygen tank.",
      "Throughout the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of an intelligent man who used his charm to take advantage of a vulnerable young woman. She was living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within about two weeks.",
      "On Monday, the woman described being asked to pay for their dates, cover Rossi's car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn't be evicted from his apartment and take on debt to buy their engagement rings.",
      "\"I was a little bit more of a timid person back then, and so it was harder for me to stand up for myself,\" she said.",
      "The relationship spiraled quickly after their engagement, with Rossi \"becoming controlling and saying mean things to me,\" she testified. The couple got into a fight in which Rossi allegedly pounded on her car and used his body to block her from pulling out of the parking garage. She finally let him inside and drove him home but said she had no plans of continuing a relationship.",
      "She agreed to go into his house to talk, but he instead pushed her onto his bed, held her down and \"forced me to have sex with him,\" she testified. The woman described lying still, paralyzed with fear.",
      "The woman said dismissive comments from her parents convinced her not to go to the police at the time. She came forward a decade later after she saw him in the news and learned he was accused of another rape from the same year.",
      "Rossi's lawyers sought to convince the jury that his accuser built up years of resentment after he made her foot the bill for everything in their monthlong relationship. They argued she accused him of rape to get back at him years later when he was getting media attention.",
      "Attorneys for Rossi didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment after the verdict Wednesday night.",
      "Rossi's accuser in the Utah County case did, however, go to the police at the time. She took the stand Tuesday to testify about her own experiences with Rossi.",
      "Rossi is accused of attacking the second woman, another former girlfriend, at his apartment in Orem in September 2008 after she came over to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer. When police initially interviewed Rossi, he claimed she had raped him and threatened to have him killed.",

      "Health care staffing shortages at the Department of Veterans Affairs are on the rise, according to a new watchdog report.",
      "In the report, out Tuesday, the VA's Office of Inspector General, or OIG, found Veterans Health Administration facilities reported 4,434 staffing shortages this fiscal year, which is a 50% increase from fiscal year 2024.",
      "Almost all \u2014 94% \u2014 of facilities reported severe shortages for medical officers, while 79% of facilities reported severe shortages for nurses, according to the report.",
      "The report's data comes from questionnaires sent to 139 VHA facilities, comparing 2025 responses to 2018-2024 responses. The 2025 questionnaires were distributed via email on March 26 with a required completion date of April 9. Data on staffing shortages at VA facilities has been collected annually for over a decade, and the report notes that this is the eighth report to identify severe occupational staffing shortages at the facility level.",
      "The report notes that the OIG did not independently verify VHA data for accuracy or completeness. It also says that due to the timing of the questionnaire, any impact on staffing from OPM's Deferred Resignation Program and VA's workforce reshaping efforts \u2014 which are expected to lead to further staffing shortages \u2014 were not fully reflected.",
      "In response to the report, Pete Kasperowicz, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said it is \"not based on actual VA health care facility vacancies and therefore is not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.\"",
      "\"The report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,\" he said in an emailed statement to CBS News on Wednesday. \"VA's department-wide vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively. These are lower than most other health care systems, in line with normal VA historical averages and much lower than the respective 19% and 20% physician and nurse vacancy rates VA saw at times during the Biden Administration.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the OIG's office seeking a response to Kasperowicz's statement.",
      "Others criticized the Trump administration after the findings.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said, \"Under this administration, we've seen policy after policy that makes it harder for public servants to do their jobs and ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they've earned.\"",
      "\"We also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting. How do skyrocketing staffing shortages and declining applicant pools make it more 'efficient' for veterans to access the care and services they deserve? The answer is: they don't,\" Warner said in a statement. \"If the administration is serious about honoring our veterans, it needs to stop undermining the VA workforce and start recruiting and retaining the skilled professionals who care for our heroes.\"",
      "Among the VHA facilities surveyed this year, at least 20% reported severe staffing shortages for more than 40 occupations \u2014 marking the highest number of job shortages reported since 2018, according to the report.",
      "Severe staffing shortages were also reported for psychologists at 57% of VHA facilities. For non-clinical positions, the highest reported shortage was for police officers, which about 58% of facilities reported.",

Any extension beyond 30 days requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate.",

      "Although Republicans have majorities in both the House and Senate, the extension would require the support of at least seven Democrats to advance, since most legislation functions under a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats.",

      "EWS, which is\u00a0co-owned\u00a0by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo,\u00a0launched\u00a0the Zelle app in 2017.

      "As of 2024, the app has 151 million users, according to Zelle's\u00a0website.",
      "The push to launch Zelle led to design oversights that made the network \"an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity,\" the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0alleges. Those alleged flaws include Zelle's quick registration process and lack of verification, which James claims made it easy for scammers to infiltrate the service.",

The trip also aimed to raise $1 million for childhood cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Guo flew his Cessna 182Q to North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe before heading to Antarctica.",
      "Prosecutors said he was authorized to fly to the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, which is often used as a base for excursions to Antarctica. Authorities said Guo provided \"false flight plan data\" and traveled to King George Island. Guo's flight plan only included his landing in Punta Arenas, authorities said. Chile claims ownership of the island, which is about 75 miles off the coast of Antarctica.",
      "Guo was detained at the airport on King George Island. On June 29, he was charged with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, both breaches of the Chilean Aeronautical Code. The code calls for short-term imprisonment or a fine for anyone who lands on the country's territory without authorization.",

He must also leave Chile as soon as conditions allow, and is prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.",

      "Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan beat the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane in a flight that took him soaring to 9,521 meters, or 31,237 feet, his team announced Wednesday.",
      "The SolarStratos plane made the landmark flight from Sion airport in southwest Switzerland on Tuesday, taking advantage of warm air thermals to go beyond the record that has stood for 15 years.",
      "The certified altitude record for a solar plane stands at 9,235 meters, or 30,298 feet.",
      "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
      "At cruising altitude, Domjan actually crossed paths with a commercial airliner, SolarStratos said, calling the moment \"a powerful symbol of what the decarbonized aviation of tomorrow might look like.\"",
      "Domjan's flight lasted five hours and nine minutes.",
      "\"I share this moment of joy with all the people who have been preparing for this achievement for years,\" the 53-year-old said.",

      "\"It is the pressure altitude corrected to standard density altitude that is recognized as the official reference for aviation altitude records,\" the SolarStratos team said.",
      "Domjan \u2014 whose company bio describes him as a \"eco-adventurer\" and lecturer who pilots planes, gliders and helicopters \u2014 is aiming to be the first to take a solar-powered plane above 10,000 meters, flying at the same altitude as airliners. If that barrier is broken, the team hopes to go on and make a first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, which at Switzerland's latitude begins at around 12,000 meters.",
      "\"This achievement marks a major milestone on the path toward reaching the stratosphere using only solar power -- and already fulfils the mission's goal: to capture imaginations with emblematic, spectacular challenges that promote solar energy and the protection of our biosphere and planet,\" SolarStratos said.",
      "The front-mounted single propeller plane, registration HB-SXA, is made of carbon fiber to ensure lightness and strength. SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",
      "\"It's important to demonstrate what we can achieve with solar energy,\" the adventurer told AFP.",
      "\"The dream of flight is probably the oldest dream of mankind,\" he said.",
      "\"My goal is to show to the young generation of today and tomorrow that tomorrow it will still be possible to fly without burning any fossil energies,\" he said.",
      "\"This is what we want to achieve: it's really to show that the world of tomorrow can be better than what we have today,\" he added.",
      "A warm-up flight on July 31 got to 6,589 meters, surpassing the plane's previous best in 2024.",
      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",
      "Before takeoff, the batteries must be fully charged using solar energy, and the plane has to land under its own power \u2014 it cannot glide back in on zero charge \u2014 and have at least 16% charge in the batteries.",

    "story": [
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to London on Thursday, a day before a critical U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska.",
      "\"Yesterday, together with all partners, today in a bilateral format, we discussed expectations from the meeting in Alaska and possible prospects,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post after the meeting. \"We also discussed in detail security guarantees that can make peace truly sustainable if the United States still manages to pressure Russia to stop the killings and engage in real meaningful diplomacy. It is important that we can all work together within a coalition of those willing to achieve effective formats for security work.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's trip to the British capital came a day after he took part in virtual meetings from Berlin with President Trump and the leaders of several European countries. Those leaders said Mr. Trump had assured them he would make it a priority to try to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Anchorage.",
      "Putin was holding a meeting in Russia on Thursday with members of Russia's leadership to prepare for the Alaska meeting. As part of that preparatory meeting, he said he wanted to discuss the negotiation process with Ukraine and how it was going.",
      "Putin also said he planned \"to talk about the stage we are at with the current American administration, which, as everyone knows, is making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Thursday that the Friday meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin in Alaska is expected to begin at around 11:30 a.m. local time on Friday. The main topic will be the war in Ukraine, but there will also be discussions about economic cooperation between Washington and Moscow.",
      "He said the meeting will take place at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base, and that there will first be a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders before their delegations join.",
      "Mr. Trump and Putin will say a few words at the start of the meeting, Ushakov said, and they will hold a joint press conference afterward.",
      "Ushakov said each delegation will have five members. For Russia, those will be Ushakov, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev, and Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.",
      "Alaska summit \"hugely important\"",
      "Both Zelenskyy and the Europeans have worried the bilateral U.S.-Russia summit would leave them and their interests sidelined, and that any conclusions reached could favor Moscow and leave Ukraine and Europe's future security in jeopardy.",
      "Yet some of those leaders, like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, praised Wednesday's video conference with Mr. Trump as constructive.",
      "Speaking after the meetings to reporters, Mr. Trump warned of \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after Friday's meeting.",
      "Starmer on Wednesday said the Alaska summit would be \"hugely important,\" and could be a \"viable\" path to a ceasefire in Ukraine. But he also alluded to European concerns that Mr. Trump may strike a deal that forces Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, and warned that Western allies must be prepared to step up pressure on Russia if necessary.",
      "During a call Wednesday among leaders of countries involved in the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv \u2014 Starmer stressed that any deal reached on bringing the fighting to an end must protect the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine.",
      "\"International borders cannot be, and must not be changed by force,'' he said. \"Any talk about borders, diplomacy, ceasefire has to sit alongside a robust and credible security guarantee to ensure that any peace, if there is peace, is lasting peace and Ukraine can defend its territorial integrity as part of any deal.\"",
      "Kyiv has long insisted that safeguards against future Russian attacks provided by its Western allies would be a precondition for achieving a durable end to the fighting in Ukraine. Yet many Western governments have been hesitant to commit to engaging their military personnel.",
      "Countries in the \"coalition of the willing,\" which include France and the U.K., have been trying for months to secure U.S. security backing should it be required. Following Wednesday's virtual meetings, Macron said Mr. Trump told the assembled leaders that while the NATO military alliance must not be part of future security guarantees, the U.S. leader agreed that \"the United States and all the parties involved should take part.\"",
      "\"It's a very important clarification that we have received,\" Macron said.",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa also welcomed \"the readiness of the United States to share with Europe the efforts to reinforce security conditions once we obtain a durable and just peace for Ukraine.\"",
      "\"I don't see any changes coming\"",
      "With another high-level meeting on their country's future on the horizon, some Ukrainians expressed skepticism that any breakthroughs would be achieved during Friday's U.S.-Russia summit.",
      "Oleksandra Kozlova, 39, a department head at a digital agency in Kyiv, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she believes Ukrainians \"have already lost hope\" that meaningful progress can be made on ending the 3 1/2-year-old war.",
      "\"I don't think this round will be decisive,\" she said. \"There have already been enough meetings and negotiations promising us, ordinary people, that something will be resolved, that things will get better, that the war will end. Unfortunately, this has not happened, so personally I don't see any changes coming.\"",
      "Anton Vyshniak, a car salesman in Kyiv, said Ukraine's priority now should be saving the lives of its military servicepeople, even at the expense of making territorial concessions.",
      "\"At the moment, the most important thing is to preserve the lives of male and female military personnel. After all, there are not many human resources left,\" he said. \"Borders are borders, but human lives are priceless. Therefore, some principles can be disregarded here.\"",
      "Russian strikes in Ukraine's Sumy region overnight Wednesday resulted in numerous injuries, Ukrainian regional officials said. A missile strike on a village in the Seredyna-Budska community injured a 7-year-old girl and a 27-year-old man, according to regional governor Oleh Hryhorov. The girl was hospitalized in stable condition.",
      "In the southern Kherson region, Russian artillery fire struck the village of Molodizhne on Thursday morning, injuring a 16-year-old boy, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. The teenager suffered an explosive injury, shrapnel wounds to his arms and legs and an acute stress reaction. He was hospitalized in moderate condition, Prokudin said.",
      "In Russia, an oil refinery in the Volgograd region caught fire after a Ukrainian drone attack overnight, according to local governor Andrei Bocharov. The refinery, one of the biggest producers of petroleum products in southern Russia, has been a frequent target of drone attacks, according to Russian independent news site Meduza.",
      "Overall, Russia's Defense Ministry reported destroying 44 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions and the annexed Crimea overnight.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's far-right finance minister announced approval Thursday of the construction of a contentious settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that Palestinians and rights groups worry would scuttle plans for a future Palestinian state by effectively cutting the West Bank into two separate parts.",
      "The announcement comes as several major U.S. allies have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state\u00a0in September.",
      "\"This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize,\" said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. \"Anyone in the world who tries today to recognize a Palestinian state - will receive an answer from us on the ground.\"",
      "Development in E1, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous administrations. On Thursday, Smotrich praised President Trump and U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee as \"true friends of Israel as we have never had before.\"",
      "The E1 plan hasn't yet received its final approval, which is expected next week. The plan includes around 3,500 apartments to expand the settlement of Maale Adumim, Smotrich said. While some bureaucratic steps remain, if the process moves quickly, infrastructure work could begin in the next few months and construction of homes could start in around a year.",
      "Rights groups swiftly condemned the plan. Peace Now called it \"deadly for the future of Israel and for any chance of achieving a peaceful two-state solution\" that is \"guaranteeing many more years of bloodshed.\"",
      "The Palestinian foreign ministry called the plan an extension of crimes of what it says are genocide, displacement and annexation, the Reuters news agency reports. Israel fiercely denies those characterizations.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if Netanyahu backs the E1 plan, Reuters said.",
      "Smotrich's popularity has dropped in recent months, Reuters notes, with polls showing his party wouldn't win a single seat if parliamentary elections were held today.",

      "In a scheme dating back to 2012, four cartel associates are accused of defrauding American citizens of their life savings through elaborate rental and resale schemes, according to a Treasury statement. In the span of six months, officials said they were able to document $23.1 million sent from mostly people in the U.S. to scammers in Mexico.",
      "The sanctions imposed by the Trump administration would prohibit Americans from doing business with the alleged cartel associates and block any of their assets in the U.S..",

In June 2023, U.S. and Mexican officials confirmed that as many as\u00a0eight young workers\u00a0were confirmed dead after they apparently tried to quit jobs at a call center operated by the Jalisco cartel.",

      "\"We want to make sure that the right chronology happens: that there is a ceasefire and that there is an agreement that is discussed after that,\" he said. \"A legal recognition of Russian ownership of this territory cannot happen. There have to be robust security guarantees. The sovereignty of Ukraine has to be respected. Negotiations have to be part of a larger transatlantic strategy, and has to be part of necessary pressure on Russia.\"",
      "Merz added, \"If there is no movement on the Russian side, we and the U.S. have to put more pressure on Russia. President Trump knows this position and largely agrees with it, and we had a good conversation with each other.\"",

      "The overarching fear of many European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would not give up any territory it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.",
      "He said diplomatic discussions led by the U.S. focusing on ending the war have not addressed key Ukrainian demands, including security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression and including Europe in negotiations and rehabilitate Putin.",
      "General Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told CBS News partner network BBC News he didn't believe Friday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could lead to an end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"Russia has to recognize and Putin has to recognize that Zelenskyy is president of Ukraine, recognize the Ukrainian constitution and Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state. And that is only going to happen ... when Russia gets a really bloody nose. And for that to happen, we need to see some proper strategic thinking from NATO - from the president of the United States - that recognizes that this is about transatlantic security.\"",
      "Shirreff said an end to the war would require Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.",
      "\"Even if Putin moves on or falls under a bus, we're probably likely to get somebody in place just as hard-line, just as ultra-nationalistic, and just as determined to press on (with Russia's takeover of Ukraine),\" Shirreff said. \"So I think we have to recognize that European security means deterrence - a band of deterrent steel, as I've said many times - from the Baltic to the Black Sea, with Ukraine as a NATO member. Now, however far-fetched that may seem from where we are at the moment, that's the reality. ... Any sort of compromise now, any so-called freezing of conflict, is only going to continue to postpone it.\"",

      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday that the mechanics of the meeting were \"still being ironed out.\"",
      "Leavitt described the meeting as \"a listening exercise for the president.\"",
      "\"Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"Trump has obviously not been listening at all because it's very clear \u2014 and Putin continues to make it clear \u2014 what his demands are, and he's not stepped back one iota from his maximalist demands,\" former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Shirreff said. \"And those, as we've heard, are simply impossible for Ukraine to accept without capitulation.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday at the Kennedy Center if he believes he can convince Putin to stop targeting Ukrainian civilians, Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"I've had that conversation with him. I've had a lot of good conversations with him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the streets. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I've had this conversation.\"",

    "summary": "A 19-year-old pilot from the United States has been detained on an Antarctic island and charged by Chilean authorities, who say his flight to the frozen continent was unauthorized.",
    "story": [
      "An American teenager was detained on an Antarctic island while attempting to pilot his small plane to every continent, said Chilean authorities, who have charged him for allegedly submitting a false flight plan. The 19-year-old pilot, Ethan Guo, denies the accusation and says the month-and-a-half-long ordeal is taking a toll on his health.",
      "Guo gained an online following by documenting his trip around the world, which lasted well over 100 days and had already taken him to six continents prior to the Antarctic voyage, according to his website and social media posts.",
      "Guo said he hoped to become the first pilot to complete a solo flight across all seven continents in a small Cessna, a feat that simultaneously aims to raise $1 million for cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. On his site, the teen cites his cousin's 2021 cancer diagnosis as his source of inspiration.",
      "Guo's latest Instagram posts chronicled part of his path over southeastern Asia. Authorities in South America say he went on to traverse the Pacific Ocean, ending up in Chile before making his way toward Antarctica.",
      "According to Cristian Cristoso Rifo, the regional prosecutor of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica, Guo departed from the airport in the city of Punta Arenas, near the southernmost point of Chile, and proceeded to conduct an unauthorized flight to King George Island. Located off the Atlantic coast, the island is claimed by Chile as part of its Atlantic territory.",
      "The young pilot landed his plane at the island's Teniente R. Marsh Airport, where he was detained, Cristoso said in a video statement shared on social media on Monday. He said Guo submitted a flight plan that indicated his plans to fly over Punta Arenas, but not farther than that.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, attorneys for Guo say those accusations are unfounded. \"Documentary evidence and audio recordings provided to the prosecutor definitively show that Mr. Guo's original destination was Ushuaia, Argentina,\" they write.",
      "But they say due to \"bureaucratic confusion,\" Chilean officials told him to \"circle in darkness over Tierra del Fuego before proceeding to Ushuaia at sunrise\" \u2014 and that's when he ran into dangerous flight conditions.",
      "\"He encountered instrument failures and heavy, unreported icing conditions caused by high cloud cover over the Andes, creating an imminent risk of a crash. To avert disaster, he diverted over the ocean. Once over the ocean, he experienced engine-related issues, likely to due to sudden, weather-related pressure changes.\"",
      "They say he then requested and received permission to land at the Marsh base from a high-ranking Chilean aviation official via WhatsApp.",
      "The prosecutor's office charged Guo for violating two articles of the Chilean Aeronautical Code, including one that calls for either short-term imprisonment or a fine brought down on anyone who lands in Chilean territory without legitimate authorization.",
      "The prosecutor said that in addition to his alleged breaches of the aeronautical code, Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes taken to get there. His unauthorized flight also posed safety risks for air traffic to the frozen continent, Cristoso added.",
      "The statement from Guo's representatives blames prosecutors for refusing to acknowledge \"clear evidence\" exonerating him, \"resulting in his de facto confinement on the island for a month and a half.\"",
      "They say stress of the ordeal has caused \"severe deterioration in his health,\" including loss of more than 40 pounds and a diagnosis with pericarditis, inflammation of tissue around the heart.",
      "\"While he is grateful for efforts to secure him passage on a boat, he is frustrated that there is no plan for his plane, preventinghim from continuing his charitable mission to raise funds for St. Jude,\" they write.",

    "story": [
      "Reindeer populations across the Arctic will likely decline substantially due to\u00a0climate change\u00a0in the next several decades with the North American population facing the highest risk, researchers predict.",
      "While the species has survived multiple periods of Arctic warming, climate change has already contributed to the loss of nearly two-thirds of the global populations of reindeer in the last three decades, according to the research team, led by the University of Adelaide in Australia and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.",
      "There are about 9 million reindeer globally, including those that are domesticated, according to the World Population Review.",
      "The North American wild reindeer, also called caribou and estimated at around 3.5 million by the World Population Review, are most at risk from a warming climate, the researchers said. Caribou are found in Alaska and Canada.",
      "The caribou populations could decline by up to 80% by 2100, \"unless there are major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and increased investment in wildlife management and conservation,\" Damien Fordham, an associate professor and deputy director of the Environment Institute at the University of Adelaide, said in a statement.",
      "The researchers came to their conclusion by examining how reindeer have responded to past climate events.",
      "\"Using fossils, ancient DNA and computer models, we reconstructed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer over the past 21,000 years at resolutions never done before, and we directly compared these to future predictions,\" lead researcher Elisabetta Canteri said in a statement.",
      "They found that populations of reindeer have declined during past periods of \"rapid climate warming.\"",
      "\"But the losses expected in the coming decades due to future climate change are likely to be even more severe than those in the past,\" Canteri said.",
      "A decline in reindeer populations also could have wider ecological implications because the animals help maintain plant diversity in the tundra.",
      "\"A reduction in tundra plant diversity resulting from the loss of reindeer and caribou will have many cascading effects, including reduction of carbon storage in Arctic soils,\" said Eric Post, a professor at the University of California Davis who contributed to the research. \"Continued losses will likely further exacerbate climatic warming through release of soil carbon to the atmosphere, which of course would further threaten reindeer and caribou as well as ourselves.\"",

The trip also aimed to raise $1 million for childhood cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Guo flew his Cessna 182Q to North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe before heading to Antarctica.",
      "Prosecutors said he was authorized to fly to the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, which is often used as a base for excursions to Antarctica. Authorities said Guo provided \"false flight plan data\" and traveled to King George Island. Guo's flight plan only included his landing in Punta Arenas, authorities said. Chile claims ownership of the island, which is about 75 miles off the coast of Antarctica.",
      "Guo was detained at the airport on King George Island. On June 29, he was charged with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, both breaches of the Chilean Aeronautical Code. The code calls for short-term imprisonment or a fine for anyone who lands on the country's territory without authorization.",
      "Chilean prosecutor Cristi\u00e1n Cristoso also said that Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes used to travel there. The unauthorized flight posed safety risks for other air travelers, Cristoso said.",
      "Since being charged, Guo has stayed at a military base on the island. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take.",
      "Guo was also unable to fly his Cessna. Cristoso told reporters on Monday that Guo's plane \"does not have the capabilities to make a flight,\" but did not provide more details.",
      "On Monday, a judge dropped the charges against Guo as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chilean prosecutors. The agreement requires Guo make a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days to avoid a trial. He must also leave Chile as soon as conditions allow, and is prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.",
      "The prosecutor's office said Guo must also pay all costs for his \"aircraft security and personal maintenance\" during his stay at the military facility. He also needs to cover all expenses for his return.",
      "Guo told The Associated Press in a text that he was \"relieved by the outcome.\"",
      "Guo said he is awaiting approval for his departure flight from Antarctica. He is talking with his lawyer to see if there is any way he can continue to fly his Cessna, and said he hopes he can continue with his \"original mission.\"",

      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",

      "Patrick Gaspard, who has served in several high-profile political positions, including advising former President Barack Obama's historic 2008 campaign, serving as the Democratic National Committee's executive director, and being tapped as the Center for American Progress (CAP) president in 2021, has been informally advising Mamdani on the side and recently introduced Obama campaign architect David Axelrod to him, a recent New York Times article revealed.",
      "A New York Times opinion piece that was published on Wednesday explained how Obama world operatives were starting to coalesce around Mamdani and have been in communication with his campaign behind the scenes. Obama reportedly called Mamdani after his Democratic primary victory in June, offering advice about the importance of governing and giving constituents optimism in dark times.",

      "\"His accomplishments, in the face of distortions and threats from extremists, will be lauded well into the future,\" he continued. In a long 2023 X thread, Gaspard also attempted to deflect blame away from Soros amid reports that Soros and his network were pouring millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of radical DAs and far-left groups that emphasized social justice programs and gave lenient sentences to violent criminals.",
      "\"George Soros is as concerned about public safety as anyone else. But he recognizes that our criminal justice system is badly broken, and in need of new ideas and new approaches \u2013 a view that enjoyed bipartisan consensus in the before times,\" Gaspard claimed.",

The precursor to the present Congress convened in Philadelphia. But Continental Army soldiers staged what was known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, claiming the \"Congress of the Confederation\" owed them back pay. The incident prompted Alexander Hamilton to suggest that the Congress vacate Philadelphia. It wasn\u2019t clear that local authorities could protect the incipient Congress from the mutineers.

There was a compromise that the new nation would initiate the seat of government anywhere from what is now Hagerstown, Md., to its present location. But the law gave President George Washington authority to determine the exact location. Washington\u2019s residence was along the Potomac at Mount Vernon.

      "That\u2019s when lawmakers approved the Home Rule Act for DC. DC gained a non-voting delegate to the House (similar to those from U.S. territories) a few years earlier. But now Washington, DC would feature a mayor and a city council. But under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress would maintain ultimate authority over the city.

It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access.

Also, use a strong antivirus software and keep it updated.\u00a0 The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Easton LaChappelle founded the company in 2014 at the age of 18.",

      "People wearing the TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges.

      "A man checking his emails on his laptop.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these retirement scams feel so real",
      "Scammers now buy your personal data from data brokers to craft convincing offers. If you're in your 50s or 60s, you're a prime target. They know your age, homeownership status, estimated net worth and even retirement timeline. They don't guess, they know. Your information is being sold across hundreds of websites, and thousands of people can access it. Curious about how exposed you are?",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What is a \"pre-qualified\" retirement scam?",
      "These scams mimic real communications from financial institutions. You might get a letter or call claiming you're approved for a new investment or annuity opportunity. Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert. They create fake advisor profiles, complete with headshots, license numbers and U.S. contact info. Many even add logos or branding from familiar banks to boost credibility. But once you respond, they'll ask for private financial info or, worse, get you to transfer funds directly into their accounts.",
      "A woman typing on her laptop and taking notes in her notebook. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why older adults are prime targets",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How scammers get your data",
      "These scams are fueled by data purchased from brokers. These companies gather your details, compile profiles and sell them, often without your knowledge. You could appear on lists labeled \"Retirees with $250k+ Net Worth\" or \"Homeowners Nearing Retirement.\" It's disturbingly precise. Some brokers scrape public records, while others buy data from loyalty cards, surveys or sweepstakes. Bottom line: this happens quietly, behind your back.",
      "The financial toll of these scams",
      "In 2024, the FBI reported that seniors lost over $4.8 billion to scams, a record high. Retirement-related fraud was a major part of that. Once your money is gone, it's usually gone for good. Even if the scammer misled you, your bank may not cover the loss if you authorized the transaction. These scams drain more than just savings. They create lasting stress, fear and shame.

      "\"In practical terms, the effects of unilateral recognition are quite limited,\" Ben Shabbat said. \"The recognition does not address borders, and, in fact, most of the world has already recognized a Palestinian state when it was accepted as a U.N. observer state (in 2012).\"HAMAS ENDGAME IS \u2018LONG-TERM\u2019 AND IS PLAYING OUT FOR ALL TO SEE AS ISRAEL PUSHES DEEPER INTO GAZA",

      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week.

      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",

      "For years, conservative groups and corporate leaders argued that the U.S. government would be better if it were run like a business.",
      "For President Donald Trump, who has controlled his own businesses for decades, that looks like taking an increasingly active role in individual corporations\u2019 affairs, from manufacturing to media to tech firms.",
      "And corporations are meeting the demands of a president who is more freely exerting his powers than he did the last time he was in office. At Trump\u2019s urging, Coca-Cola said it would produce a version of its namesake soda with U.S.-grown cane sugar. Paramount paid millions to settle allegations Trump levied against CBS\u2019 venerated \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Two major semiconductor makers agreed to give the government a cut of their sales in China.

      "It centers on Andrew\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and covers his finances and dealings with foreign governments, as well as the timeline of his ties with Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 the late financier and convicted sex offender who has been the subject of fervent attention in both Britain and the United States in recent weeks.",
      "NBC royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said Thursday that the good news for Andrew and the royal family may be that the impact of this renewed focus will be blunted by the reality that his reputation is already at \u201crock bottom.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible other people might well be taking some of the heat off Andrew,\u201d she said, referring to politicians in the U.S.",

      "An earlier YouGov survey found Andrew remains by far the most unpopular royal, with just 5% of respondents saying they held a positive view of him.",
      "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, formerly known as Meghan Markle, was one place above Andrew, at 20%, with heir to the throne Prince William topping the rankings on 74%.",
      "A representative for Andrew and Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment about both the book and the polling.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.",
      "He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died by suicide in April this year, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court ruled that Andrew had been \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with Yang Tengbo as it lifted an anonymity order protecting Tengbo's identity. Tengbo had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K.",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "His public standing has remained little changed since a disastrous interview about his ties to Epstein on the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight\u201d program in November 2019.",
      "Despite this simmering anger and growing pressure, McAndrew said she doesn't think the king will take the drastic step of removing Andrew's royal titles. But, she said, William might act differently when he ascends the throne.",
      "\"He\u2019s much less sentimental as a personality. And the royal family (and future monarch peculiarly) ultimately must exist to protect the monarchy,\" she said.",
      "The royal family will have to consider whether taking new action against Andrew could run the risk of him retaliating publicly. They may feel it is better, McAndrew said, \"to let sleeping dogs lie.\""

      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers \"to inform you about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration \"is making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

    "story": [
      "A stolen 16th-century manuscript signed by the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s has been found and returned to the Mexican government, the FBI said Thursday.",
      "The rare item offers a glimpse into the government of New Spain, which grew to cover a vast stretch of land from modern-day Washington state to Louisiana and Central America.",
      "Signed by Cortez on Feb. 20, 1527, the document details payments in pesos of gold for expenses, the FBI said.",
      "Special Agent Jessica Dittmer, with the FBI\u2019s art crime team, said in a press release that the document \"really gives a lot of flavor as to the planning and preparation for unchartered territory back then.\"",
      "\"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico\u2019s history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better,\" she said.",
      "The FBI said the missing document was likely stolen between 1985 and October 1993, due to a system of wax numbering used by Mexican archivists.",
      "There will be no criminal charges connected to the case, Dittmer said, because the document had \"changed hands many times over\" since it went missing.",
      "When Cort\u00e9s signed these papers, he was governor of New Spain, an experienced and wealthy colonist who had spread Spanish control \u2014 and plenty of violence \u2014 to the Caribbean and mainland America.",
      "The same year saw the formation of New Spain\u2019s High Court, or Audiencia, and other royal and religious institutions that would play a role in the government of Mexico until the war of independence in 1810.",
      "Cort\u00e9s is more famous, however, for exploring and colonizing the Mayan kingdom in 1519 \u2014 ignoring orders to stand down from Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, Cuba's governor \u2014 and soon after conquering the Aztecs and their emperor, Moctezuma.",
      "The city of Tenochtitlan was taken and renamed Mexico City in 1521, its temples knocked down and replaced with churches.",
      "In 1506, he took part in the conquests of Hispaniola (modern-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Cuba, granting him a large estate and some Indigenous Taino slaves.",
      "This is the second Cort\u00e9s document the FBI has repatriated to Mexico: In July 2023, a letter from the conquistador authorizing the purchase of sugar was found and returned.",
      "\"We know how important it is for the United States to stay ahead of this, to support our foreign partners, and to try and make an impact as it relates to the trafficking of these artistic works and antiquities,\" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Veh Bezdikian, who oversees the FBI-NYPD major theft task force.",
      "But the search for several other missing pages from the same collection continues. The FBI is appealing for anyone with information to come forward and contact nyartcrime@fbi.gov or submit a tip to 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or by visiting tips.fbi.gov."

    "story": [
      "The 2025-26 Premier League season is almost upon us and there is so much intrigue as teams look to close the gap with reigning champions Liverpool and finish in the Champions League spots.",
      "With a record number of teams in European competitions, the strength of the Premier League is perhaps at its peak, and the promoted teams all look strong and prepared for the nine-month gauntlet that awaits from August until May.",
      "Let\u2019s take a look at the key storylines heading into the new season.",
      "Can new-look Liverpool get the balance right?",
      "After spending big on four new key signings this summer (and possibly adding striker Alexander Isak in the coming weeks for a British record transfer fee of over $150 million), reigning Premier League champions Liverpool have not stood still. But their expensive rebuild has shown signs of early growing pains.",
      "German playmaker Florian Wirtz is a generational talent and looks like a bargain, even for $133 million. Forward Hugo Ekitike is still raw but will score plenty. New full backs Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are exciting and energetic. Yet the balance has been off in preseason and manager Arne Slot knows it.",
      "Liverpool will score in bunches but it\u2019s all about getting the balance right, especially in defense and out wide. With Trent Alexander-Arnold sold to Real Madrid and Andy Robertson now a backup, Liverpool\u2019s strength for so long has been out wide defensively. This season they\u2019ll have a new-look attacking line and be susceptible on the counter as new players figure out how to get the all-important balance right. That is the job for Slot and experienced leaders like Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah to sort out.",
      "Liverpool\u2019s title bid may get off to a slightly shaky start as they try to figure it all out. Add in the absolutely tragic loss of forward Diogo Jota this summer after he was killed in a car crash and Liverpool have been working through a lot. But they will get there and the talent they have is undoubted. The big question: can all of their new attacking players play together from the start? Liverpool are still the favorites to win the title again, but there are plenty more questions than answers heading into the opening game.",
      "Gyokeres could be the final piece in Arsenal\u2019s trophy-hungry jigsaw",
      "For so long Arsenal have wanted, and needed, a proper center forward to finish goal-scoring chances. Now they have it in Viktor Gyokeres. The Swedish striker buried a header in their final preseason game and you could see the cogs swirling around inside the heads of Arsenal fans. \u201cHang on, is this it!?\u201d",
      "The comparisons to when Erling Haaland arrived at Manchester City are plentiful and although Gyokeres still has a long way to go to reach those levels, on a simplistic level this should work. Arsenal create so many chances, whip in so many crosses and they drew 14 games in the Premier League last season. Gyokeres\u2019 arrival will surely help them win more of those tight games and that will close the gap to Liverpool as the Gunners aim to avoid a fourth-straight second-place finish and finally win a trophy.",
      "At this point they will take the League Cup, FA Cup and of course a first-ever Champions League title. But after a strong summer of early spending in the transfer market, Arsenal have perhaps never been closer to winning the Premier League for the first time since 2004. It all hinges on Gyokeres finishing off the chances Bukayo Saka and Co. will put on a plate for him.",
      "Change of culture, new forward line has Manchester United looking up",
      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim hit the reset button hard after a tough first eight months in charge. Last season was a disaster in the Premier League but United showed they could still rise to the occasion as they made it to the Europa League final where they lost to Tottenham. That probably did them a favor as they have no European action to worry about this season and Amorim can work longer and harder on the training ground with his squad.",
      "In preseason all the talk has been about a change in culture at United. They have moved on Marcus Rashford, while Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund are next, and a line has been drawn in the sand. This underachievement can\u2019t go on. United have added real quality and experience in attack with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko coming in.",
      "Over the last 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, there have been so many false dawns about United rekindling their glory days. Amorim knows a top-six finish and a strong cup run is the very least United need to achieve this season if they\u2019re going to show people they\u2019re back on the right path. United have been going through this rebuild for most of the last decade but it still feels very similar to the New England Patriots\u2019 current painful rebuild after the glory days of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. But there\u2019s hope that United can be competitive and if they can stay solid defensively they now have the right combination of players, and characters, in attack to win games.",
      "The culture is changing and Amorim\u2019s side have had a brilliant preseason. Can they keep it going amid a tough start to the season as they face all of Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their first five games?",
      "After Club World Cup glory, Chelsea can challenge for the title",
      "Chelsea have some serious momentum heading into the new season as Enzo Maresca\u2019s young side won the Club World Cup, unexpectedly, this summer and that has seen them grow massively in confidence. Cole Palmer is their star but new recruits Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens will give them an extra cutting edge and decisiveness in the final third.",
      "That\u2019s the thing Chelsea missed last season as Maresca\u2019s side dominated games but couldn\u2019t put teams away. They have the Champions League to look forward to too and there is no slowing down in signing new players as Xavi Simons, Alejandro Garnacho and others are linked with moves to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea\u2019s huge squad was the main reason they could win the Club World Cup. If Maresca can balance and rotate well, watch out.",
      "Other storylines to keep an eye on\u2026",
      "Record nine Premier League teams will play in Europe",
      "Get used to plenty of Premier League teams rotating their lineups as a record nine teams will compete in European competitions this season. Six teams are in the Champions League with Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle joined by Tottenham Hotspur courtesy of the latter winning the Europa League last season. Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest will be in the Europa League and Crystal Palace are in the Conference League. Having this many teams in Europe will be intriguing as squads will be stretched to their limits, especially in the autumn and winter months.",
      "Americans own 11 teams",
      "There are now 11 teams out of the 20 in the Premier League that are either fully or part-owned by Americans. Two newly-promoted teams in Leeds United and Burnley are owned by U.S. based groups and with the duo of Birmingham City (Tom Brady is involved) and Wrexham (Ryan Reynolds and Co.) in the second-tier also owned by Americans and pushing hard for promotion to the Premier League this season, we could soon see close to 66 percent of the Premier League owned by U.S. investors.",
      "Manchester City continues to wait for a verdict",
      "After winning four-straight titles, Pep Guardiola and Manchester City rallied to finish third place last season as new signings in January kicked them on. City have added the likes of Ait-Nouri, Cherki and Reijnders in the summer, and even if they aren\u2019t favorites for the title, they will be up there. But there is still plenty of doubt about their future as the verdict regarding the 115 charges from the Premier League against them (the charges are for a period from 2009 until 2018) still loom.",
      "Nobody knows exactly what will happen, and when, as City are steadfast in their claim that they are innocent. On the pitch City will look to get back to being title contenders and they should be up there. Off the pitch, after many years of uncertainty, it\u2019s still a mystery what will happen next.",
      "Promoted clubs can buck instant relegation trend",
      "Leeds have spent a lot, and well, while Burnley have also been impressive with the transfers they\u2019ve made. But Sunderland have perhaps surprised everyone the most. They\u2019ve been able to sign important players like Granit Xhaka and Simon Adingra and the three new teams look set to try and stop the rot for newly-promoted clubs.",
      "In each of the last two years, all three promoted clubs have been instantly relegated and it hasn\u2019t been particularly competitive as the gap between the Premier League and second-tier grows bigger. But there is a real hope that these three have learned from the mistakes of others, while the likes of Brentford, Bournemouth and Wolves have lost some of their best players this summer and the relegation scrap should be a lot closer."

    "summary": "Companies like Apple, Coca-Cola and Nvidia are meeting the demands of President Trump, who is more freely exercising power over big business in his second term.",
    "story": [
      "For years, conservative groups and corporate leaders argued that the U.S. government would be better if it were run like a business.",
      "For President Donald Trump, who has controlled his own businesses for decades, that looks like taking an increasingly active role in individual corporations\u2019 affairs, from manufacturing to media to tech firms.",
      "And corporations are meeting the demands of a president who is more freely exerting his powers than he did the last time he was in office. At Trump\u2019s urging, Coca-Cola said it would produce a version of its namesake soda with U.S.-grown cane sugar. Paramount paid millions to settle allegations Trump levied against CBS\u2019 venerated \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Two major semiconductor makers agreed to give the government a cut of their sales in China. The CEO of Intel met with Trump soon after the president called on him to resign.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much different than the first term,\u201d said a Republican lobbyist whose firm represents several Fortune 500 companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cHe\u2019s just acting like a businessman. In his first term, I think he was trying to cosplay as a politician. He\u2019s more comfortable in his own skin, too. He can explain deals better.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s role represents a break with past administrations that may have been unwilling or unable, politically, to bring similar pressure to bear on businesses. In the past, small-government conservatives once accused previous Democratic administrations of attempting to \u201cpick winners and losers\u201d by trying to regulate industries. Trump today stands downstream of a bolder right-wing movement that calls for enhanced state intervention in corporate affairs.",
      "Trump has said the corporate concessions are intended to boost the U.S. economy.",
      "And the White House, in a statement, reinforced the idea that Trump\u2019s involved approach to private-sector dealings is a key part of his economic agenda.",
      "\u201cCooled inflation, trillions in new investments, historic trade deals, and hundreds of billions in tariff revenue prove how President Trump\u2019s hands-on leadership is paving the way towards a new Golden Age for America,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-administration-hits-hurdles-builds-key-immigrant-detention-facil-rcna224608",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "A new detention facility at Fort Bliss is set to open this week after problems that may preview issues to come as ICE ramps up for mass deportation.",
    "story": [
      "Later this week, the Trump administration is set to open a sprawling new immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss in Texas that is slated to eventually become the largest in the nation.",
      "The opening comes after months of setbacks, including two investigations into possible improper bidding, two canceled contracts and, most recently, a death on the construction site.",
      "The facility, which will open with capacity to hold 1,000 people, is a key part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s moves to more than double the space it has nationwide to detain immigrants as the Trump administration pushes for more arrests and the agency prepares for a historic influx of cash.",
      "Once seen as the answer to ICE\u2019s detention space crunch \u2014 after a previous attempt at an answer, the naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, failed \u2014 Fort Bliss is now also an example of the complications that can arise when ICE scrambles to expand detention. The agency has been under intense pressure from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and others in the Trump administration to quickly ramp up the number of immigrants it arrests. It is currently holding a record 60,000 immigrants in detention, according to an ICE official. And it is out of space.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say all ICE field offices are looking for more ICE detention space,\u201d another ICE official told NBC News.",
      "Like the \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d camp that Florida has built to detain immigrants, the facility at Fort Bliss is a temporary, soft-sided tent style structure. ICE is increasingly leaning toward building that kind of detention space rather than brick-and-mortar facilities.",
      "Last week, two of the major private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group, both of which are heavily involved in ICE detention, told shareholders they expect soft-sided facilities to be a major part of the push to ramp up capacity, in part because the government can get them up and running much faster.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t build a brick-and-mortar newly built facility in probably less than two years,\u201d one former Department of Homeland Security official said.",
      "In order to expand detention capacity, though, ICE needs money. And though the Republican tax and spending act known as the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d provides $45 billion for that purpose, those dollars have not yet started to flow.",
      "Once they do, there may still be obstacles.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose purview includes ICE, has instituted a new guideline at ICE that requires any expenditure over $100,000 to be personally approved by her, which may also slow new construction, according to a private prison industry executive. (As NBC News has previously reported, Noem instituted a similar rule at FEMA, which she also oversees.)",
      "In a statement to NBC News about the approvals, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the department is \u201crooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and is reprioritizing appropriated dollars.\u201d",
      "\u201cSecretary Noem is delivering accountability to the U.S. taxpayer, which Washington bureaucrats have ignored for decades at the expense of American citizens,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "But a current DHS official, three former DHS officials and the private prison industry executive all told NBC News that while tent facilities are faster to build, they cost more in the long run.",
      "The federal government\u2019s cost per immigrant in a typical brick-and-mortar single adult detention center is roughly $125-$165 per night, according to one of the former DHS officials and the private prison industry executive. But the cost per detainee in a tent facility can be more than double that because of the added expenses related to providing things like food, laundry, air conditioning and running water in the remote areas where tent facilities are being built.",
      "Security is also a logistical challenge because it is easier for detainees to escape soft-sided structures, so tent facilities typically need more security staff on site.",
      "In the past, tent facilities have been used by Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Health and Human Services to hold migrants who had just crossed the border. But those facilities are intended to hold people only for short periods of time. CBP is only allowed to hold people for 72 hours for processing, after which they are either released, returned to Mexico or sent to ICE. And the Department of Health and Human Services prioritizes sending children to family members or other U.S. adult sponsors as quickly as possible.",
      "The Biden administration housed children who came across the border without guardians in tents at Fort Bliss in 2021. Whistleblowers decried the conditions inside and said the facility was mismanaged.",
      "Now, though, the administration envisions holding immigrants in tent facilities for the period between when they are arrested and when they are deported, which can span six months or even longer in some cases.",
      "That idea was first put to the test after Trump decided in the first weeks of his new term that he wanted to use the U.S. naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, as a facility with capacity to hold 30,000 immigrants.",
      "Many people even within the administration were surprised by the decision and Trump\u2019s announcement of it, but they immediately moved to implement his plan. By March, though, as NBC News has previously reported, there was a recognition within the administration that it was not truly workable, and attention started shifting to places like Fort Bliss. As of mid-May, Guant\u00e1namo had only held a total of 500 immigrants, and never more than 200 at any one time.",
      "In response to questions regarding the use of soft-sided facilities, McLaughlin told NBC News that DHS is \u201cpursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity\u201d and \u201ccalling on more states and local governments to help expand detention capacity.\u201d",
      "Problems at Fort Bliss",
      "DHS had asked the Department of Defense to look into alternative locations for detention centers, including Fort Bliss, in February, shortly after the administration moved on from the plan to hold 30,000 people at Guant\u00e1namo, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News at the time.",
      "The effort since then to get even 1,000 new beds up and running at Fort Bliss has been fraught with challenges.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, ICE detention is not supposed to be punitive. Under court settlements, the facilities ICE uses must meet certain standards, providing for instance air conditioning, running water and access to daily showers and hot meals. Part of the challenge of building at Fort Bliss, a 1.12 million-acre Army base in a desert location, is that Camp East Montana, the immigrant detention site there, requires its own sewage, plumbing and electrical systems, meaning contractors must work to bring in infrastructure such as portable showers.",
      "The project has been the subject of at least two investigations by the Government Accountability Office for potentially improper bidding. A contract to build the facility was first put out for bid after DHS started looking into Fort Bliss in February, awarded to a company, then canceled by late April. A public posting about the cancelation cited an executive order signed by Trump dealing with \u201cradical transparency\u201d and \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d",
      "The contract went out for bid again weeks later, this time offering it as two separate projects: One for building the facility, and one for running it. That offer was pulled before it was awarded; it is unclear why.",
      "Finally in late July, it was awarded under a Navy contract program meant for small businesses, and construction began.",
      "One of the former ICE officials told NBC News that running the contract through the Navy program guaranteed quick funding, but meant the work didn\u2019t have the direct supervision by ICE that it would have under the typical process. Instead, while it is a Navy contract, the Army is in charge of ensuring workplace safety while the facility is built for ICE. The value of the contract for building the facility reportedly totals $1.2 billion; public records show the Army having contributed about $232 million of that.",
      "The Acquisition Logistics Company, which has been serving as the top contractor overseeing the project, has come under scrutiny recently. According to public records, Acquisition Logistics is a small business run by Kenneth Wagner, 77, out of his single-family home in Virginia. Prior to this contract, the company\u2019s largest contract, according to public records, appears to have been worth $16 million.",
      "The company\u2019s website currently presents little information aside from an address and a header saying \u201cSite maintenance in progress.\u201d Attempts to reach Wagner were unsuccessful \u2014 his voicemail was full, and an email sent to an address previously listed on the website bounced back.",
      "An archived copy of the site says the company was founded in 2008 as a \u201cveteran-owned, small disadvantaged business specializing in the entire acquisition-logistics lifecycle.\u201d It also touted work it said it had done for the Marine Corps, the FAA, the Army and the National Park Service. A call to the company\u2019s chief operating officer was not returned.",
      "After the contract was awarded to Acquisition Logistics, one of the companies that did not win, Gemini Tech Services, lodged a protest, but construction moved forward. On Monday, Gemini Tech Services filed a complaint in federal court.",
      "The complaint is sealed, but a source familiar with it told NBC News that the company is seeking an immediate injunction to stop construction.",
      "Beyond questions about the contracting process at Fort Bliss, there has also been tragedy. On July 21, 38-year-old Hector Gonzalez, who was employed by Disaster Management Group, one of multiple subcontractors on the project, died in a workplace accident.",
      "\u201cHector was a beloved husband, father, son, brother and co-worker and he will be greatly missed. Our support and prayers are with his entire family,\u201d said DMG spokesperson Tom McNicholas, who confirmed Gonzalez\u2019s death.",
      "The accident is currently under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, according to agency statements. DMG has since posted a job opening for a site safety manager out of El Paso tasked with overseeing accident-prevention plans and documenting safety incidents.",
      "Asked by NBC News about Gonzalez\u2019s death, DHS did not specifically comment on the matter, and referred all contracting questions regarding Camp East Montana to the DOD.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of a GAO protest for the Acquisition Logistics contract. We cannot discuss specifics because the issue is currently in litigation. However, we can confirm that this protest is unrelated to the recent death, which is under investigation,\u201d an Army spokesperson said."

This option has a straight leg fit and 30-inch inseam with a hem that sits at or just below the ankle (for people who are 5\u201910\u201d or under).

      "How I picked the best meal delivery services",
      "I consulted with our experts about which features to consider when shopping for meal kit delivery services. Here are the most important ones to remember:",
      "Serving size: Keep in mind how many people you\u2019re looking to feed, and make sure the service offers multiple servings (if you need). A single-serve pre-prepared meal is likely best if you\u2019re only feeding yourself. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, look for a customizable plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings).Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, look for services that offer a variety of options to fit those dietary needs.Customizability: Are you a picky eater or someone who gets easily bored of eating the same meals? Look for meal delivery services that provide a weekly rotating menu with several meal options, as well as customizable features like portion size and the amount and type of protein in each meal.Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services is based on the quality of meals and ingredients, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the specific meal plan. Keep in mind that more budget-friendly services may not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your kit. Most will also let you pause plans or skip weeks as needed.",

      "We\u2019ve tested nearly a dozen meal delivery services, many of which are listed below. To pick the best ones, we looked at the following factors:",
      "Serving size: We considered how many people we\u2019re feeding, and whether the service accommodates multiple servings. For example, a few editors are feeding themselves plus a partner or families, while others are only cooking for one.Prep time: We looked at how long it took to cook or heat up meals, and whether it was worth it for a busy schedule (all of the services we recommend have easy-to-follow recipes and take less than an hour to make, or under 10 minutes to heat up). Price: We tried options across various price points, though most fall within the $10-$12 per meal range.Dietary restrictions: We tried services that catered to different diets, including gluten-free and pescatarian, and how that food actually tasted.Shipping and packaging: We considered how meals are packaged, how that packaging helps (or hinders) meal preparation and whether the shipping is quick, easy and painless.",

      "CookUnity is a favorite among several members of our NBC Select staff. You can choose from multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive per week, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals. The service provides a rotating menu of ready-made options each week, or you can let CookUnity pick them out for you based on your preferences (like your choice of protein) or any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free. You can also flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu.",
      "\u201cI started using CookUnity because I felt like I was spending so much money on groceries but still eating boring food everyday like sandwiches and salads,\u201d says former NBC Select social commerce editor Sadhana Daruvuri. \u201cNow, I can enjoy a variety of delicious meals while still spending about the same amount I\u2019d spent on groceries before.\u201d",
      "NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown is also a CookUnity fan and gets six meals delivered each week, so dinner is taken care of most days. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a time in my life when I am able to cook dinner every night but that\u2019s not the case right now \u2014 I\u2019ve tried switching up how I shop, rearranging my kitchen and meal prepping, all in hopes of cutting down on how much I spend on takeout but nothing worked until I got CookUnity,\u201d she says. Brown loves browsing and picking her meals each week: \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says.",
      "It\u2019s also a favorite of NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin: \u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 the meals show up at my door at the beginning of the week, and knowing all I need to do to cook dinner is pull the wrapper off a meal and warm it up makes my evenings totally stress-free,\u201d she says. However, Malin notes there is some more prep work involved than other services she\u2019s tried. \u201cI did have to take out some components of meals before I microwaved them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was a bit tricky and caused me to do more dishes \u2014 normally, I\u2019d reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in,\u201d she says.",

Before ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your tastes, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to make. The customizability makes this a standout service for our experts, who emphasize that you can easily choose the amount and type of protein in each meal. Ben Leonard, a chef and food educator with more than 15 years of experience, says the service is best for \u201cfamilies, kids or people with any dietary restrictions\u201d due to its variety of meal selections and customizable features.",

The service provides a rotating weekly menu of over 30 pre-made meals and caters to a number of dietary needs and preferences, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals to 18 meals per week. Factor also lets you schedule a complimentary consultation with a registered dietitian to answer nutrition questions or determine if a Factor subscription is the right choice for you.",
      "\u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. She especially likes that chefs design the meals but dietitians approve them, and the fact that they don\u2019t cater to just one special diet. \u201cI think a lot of people want to try eating plans like keto and vegan, but don\u2019t know where to begin \u2014 meal options like this let them explore something new without overcommitting and discover if a diet suits their taste preferences, their individual dietary needs and their budget before diving too deep,\u201d she says.",

She says she enjoys the selection of juices and smoothies and the convenience of thawing one at a time.

      "You can customize your weekly meal settings by selecting from six preferences: Quick & Easy, Pescatarian, Family-Friendly, Fit & Wholesome, Veggie and Chef\u2019s Choice/Meat & Veggie. The service appeals to several dietary restrictions, which impressed our NBC Select editors. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by how many HelloFresh meals fit my gluten-free and pescatarian diet, although you definitely have a lot more options if you don\u2019t have dietary restrictions,\u201d says Malin, who tried the service for a week. \u201cOverall, cooking the meals was straightforward and the portion sizes were filling.\u201d",

      "Both Resnick and Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommend Sunbasket as their top choice for healthy meal kits. \u201cIt has a variety of options that can be modified for carnivores and strictly plant-based eaters alike,\u201d says Moskovitz. Most of Sunbasket\u2019s packaging is also recyclable or compostable, using sustainable material like recycled and virgin craft paper and 100% shredded recycled paper filling, according to the brand.",

      "Technically, Hungryroot isn\u2019t a meal kit service. Instead, the NBC Select editor-favorite service is a grocery delivery method that offers a lot of the same benefits and customizations as other meal kits on this list \u2014 you take an initial quiz on your preferences and dietary needs, and Hungryroot creates a personalized grocery plan. In addition to delivering fresh food for the week, it also sends you specific recipes based on the groceries you order. You can also edit your delivery every week in case you want a specific ingredient or food item.",
      "With the ability to choose the type of meal you want (breakfast, lunch or dinner) and to customize the groceries you get, Hungryroot essentially \u201callows you to be a bit more adventurous and cook from the hip, or also follow the recipes exactly,\u201d says Leonard.",
      "How to shop for a meal delivery service",
      "The biggest factors to consider when shopping include the price per meal/serving, the quality of the ingredients, the amount of time you\u2019re willing to dedicate and your own cooking ability.",
      "The price of meal kit delivery services varies based on several factors, including the quality of meals and ingredients you\u2019re getting, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the meal plan you choose. More budget-friendly services like EveryPlate and Dinnerly will typically cost around $5 per serving, while most other popular services like HelloFresh will cost anywhere between $8 and $11 per serving. If you\u2019re looking at more premium or diet-specific services like Sunbasket and Green Chef, they will cost you approximately $12 to $15 per serving.",
      "Take advantage of trial offers, says Daniel Shumski, a recipe developer and cookbook author. \u201cSo many meal kits and delivery services offer great introductory prices \u2014 it\u2019s worth trying around to find one that fits your taste and budget,\u201d he says.",
      "The time you\u2019re willing to allocate to preparing, cooking and plating your food can help determine which meal delivery service is right for you. If you\u2019re choosing a plan that sends you all the ingredients, you should be prepared to take the time needed to prepare each dish, says Christine Wansleben, owner and culinary director at Mise En Place, which offers cooking classes, private events and more. You\u2019ll also need to ensure you\u2019re cooking the meals as soon as possible since the ingredients can be easily perishable, she adds.",
      "For those who don\u2019t have as much time during the week, ready-to-eat meal delivery services are typically the best option.",
      "Generally, meal delivery services have specific rules and procedures in place to ensure their ingredients are high-quality and trustworthy, according to the experts we talked to. But if you\u2019re extremely particular about the freshness and origin of your ingredients, you should likely skip these services and shop on your own.",
      "For those looking to meet specific nutritional goals, Moskovitz recommends paying attention to the individual ingredients in each meal plan, the nutrition facts and the portion sizes. \u201cDon\u2019t just assume that because it\u2019s homemade or marketed as \u2018healthy\u2019 that it\u2019s the healthiest option for you,\u201d she says.",
      "Certain meal delivery services will offer a variety of options for those with dietary restrictions. However, Resnick notes there\u2019s one caveat: Those with medical issues, such as shellfish allergies or celiac disease, should be mindful of possible cross-contamination.",
      "\u201cCompanies are usually forthright about shared equipment, but eaters with food intolerances should exercise caution,\u201d she says. \u201cThat said, for special diets that are usually choice-based, such as veganism or low carb, I think these services are an excellent choice.\u201d",
      "Before committing to a specific plan, you should consider when you\u2019ll be able to receive these meals to avoid ingredients spoiling or not getting delivered, according to Resnick. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery \u2014 if you know you won\u2019t be there, most services will let you skip a week (but keep in mind there is usually a cutoff time to select this option).",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Meal kits are usually less expensive than dining out or ordering delivery from a local restaurant, according to our NBC Select staff reviewers. However, it all depends on the specific meal delivery service you choose; some are more expensive than others because of premium meal options, organic ingredients and delivery rate, experts say.",
      "There are plenty of benefits to meal delivery services, including saving you time at the grocery store (or avoiding a trip altogether) and meal planning. Plus, it avoids buying too much of an ingredient that will probably go bad in a few days.",
      "\u201cMeal delivery services and kits offer the ability to eat fresh food without wasting anything or having leftovers you don\u2019t want,\u201d says Resnick.",
      "They\u2019re also a great option for culinary beginners because they offer a great opportunity to learn and try out new skills in the kitchen. \u201cI appreciate that they offer people who don\u2019t cook well a hands-on way to learn, and that they allow those who are averse to prep work the ability to avoid it while still eating fresh food,\u201d says Resnick.",
      "Meet our experts",
      "At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.",

    "story": [
      "The teacher accused of fatally stabbing an Arkansas couple while they were hiking with two of their daughters pleaded not guilty to two capital murder charges on Thursday.",
      "Andrew James McGann, a 28-year-old elementary school teacher, was arrested last month, accused of stabbing Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, to death and charged with two counts of capital murder.",
      "McGann hardly spoke and showed little emotion during the arraignment, which lasted around 30 minutes, according to NBC affiliate KNWA-TV.",
      "Authorities said that McGann made statements to investigators \"indicating that he had committed these heinous acts\" and that his DNA was found at the crime scene.",
      "In a brief statement, the Washington County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office said that \"the state continues to pursue the death penalty\" in McGann\u2019s case.",
      "McGann's lawyers from the county public defender's office declined to comment.",
      "The Brinks were hiking in Devil\u2019s Den State Park, which lies in the northwest corner of Arkansas, with their young children, who are 7 and 9 years old, authorities say.",
      "Investigators believe that Clinton was attacked first, while Cristen brought the kids to safety. Authorities said she then \"returned to help her husband\" before being attacked herself. The kids were not injured in the attack, and officials said last month that they do not believe they were targets.",
      "A motive for the attack remains unknown.",
      "Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar said last month that officials \"have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspect and our victims.\"",
      "McGann evaded authorities for several days after the Brinks were found dead. He was arrested in a Springdale, Arkansas, barbershop while getting his hair cut, roughly 30 miles from Devil's Den.",
      "Officials said McGann recently moved to Arkansas for a new job at an elementary school after teaching in various schools throughout Oklahoma. He was recently hired to teach within Springdale Public Schools in Arkansas, but had not started the new role, according to a district administrator.",
      "McGann passed background checks for his employment by Oklahoma's Education Department and for the two districts in the state where he taught.",
      "Some parents of McGann's former students said they raised concerns that he was not properly teaching their children. Others said they worried he was \"grooming\" female students.",
      "\"In early May, late April, other parents start telling me that he was having special lunches during the lunch break, where all the kids would go to the cafeteria, but then he would ask some of the special girls to stay in his classroom and have lunch with him, which was weird,\" parent Lindsay Camp Polyak previously told NBC News. \"Other moms alleged that he had encouraged some girls to sit in his lap.\"",
      "Polyak added that her son told her that McGann would give candy and other prizes to female students, and that he \"loves to play tag. He plays tag at recess every day with the girls.\"",
      "The Lewisville Independent School District in Texas, one of the districts where McGann taught and where Polyak's son is a student, said in a message to the school community that an internal investigation \"did not find any evidence of inappropriate behavior with a student.\""

It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Alahverdian's defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.",

      "In 2022 \u2014 two years after an online obituary stated that Alahverdian died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2014 Alahverdian was arrested in Scotland under the name Arthur Knight.",
      "Speaking with a British accent and appearing in a wheelchair, he denied that he was Alahverdian and claimed that he was an Irish orphan who had become a businessman.",
      "In his opening statement, the prosecutor in the Salt Lake County case said that Alahverdian admitted his true identity under oath last year. He accused Alahverdian of raping a 24-year-old woman in 2008 after a whirlwind romance and engagement.",
      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",
      "Alahverdian\u2019s defense lawyer, MacKenzie Potter, compared the allegations to an \u201cold puzzle from the thrift store,\u201d saying that \u201cnot all the pieces are there.\u201d",
      "The victim\u2019s story had changed over time, Potter said, and it can\u2019t be verified.",
      "Alahverdian, who was raised in Rhode Island\u2019s foster youth system and later became an outspoken aide in that state\u2019s legislature, was previously accused or convicted in other assault and sex crimes cases involving women with whom he was in relationships.",
      "In a case in Massachusetts in 2010, a woman he was married to at the time told authorities he held her down, grabbed her neck, struck her in the face, and refused to let her leave their home following an argument over a crying baby.",
      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

      "When she first saw the clip of him from that July 2023 episode, Swift asked around to see if he\u2019d ever tried to attend a meet-and-greet or connect at another show. Since she rarely scrolls social media and doesn\u2019t check her DMs, she found his approach refreshingly bold.",

As she walks, her cat in her arms, she briefly passes a sign reading \"A12,\" potentially hinting at her Aug. 12 announcement.",

      "Then, days after the cancellation announcement, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved an $8 billion deal, which merged Paramount Global with Skydance Media. The agreement places government conditions on the network\u2019s news division.",

      "Despite the company's response, some of Colbert's supporters have pointed to the timing surrounding the announcement.",
      "Just days before the July 17 taping, Colbert called a $16 million settlement between CBS and the Trump Administration a \u201cbig fat bribe\u201d in his opening monologue. The network agreed to the settlement after the White House filed a lawsuit over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d episode with Harris, claiming the interview was deceptively edited.",
      "In response to Trump\u2019s allegations, CBS released a statement in October 2024, saying the claims were \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment,\u201d the network wrote at the time, inviting Trump on the show for an interview during his 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Then, days after \u201cThe Late Show\u201d announcement, the FCC approved a merger between Paramount Global with Skydance Media. The $8 billion deal went into effect Aug. 7.",

      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC\u2019s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination. And Skydance\u2019s commitment to enhancing local news and reporting\u2014coverage valued by the public \u2014 will also inure to the benefit of the American people,\u201d the statement said, in part.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat who voted against the merger, called the conditions laid out in the deal a \u201cnever-before-seen forms of government control over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment \u2014 actions that violate both the First Amendment and the law.\u201d",

      "Colbert poked fun at Trump\u2019s comments during his Aug. 7 opening monologue, saying, \u201cTo be fair, I think we\u2019re all equally untalented. I just want to say thank you for watching, sir, and thank you for agreeing to be in our new promo.\u201d",
      "In the same monologue, Colbert jokingly opened the door for a new opportunity on streaming, saying, \u201cNetflix, call me I\u2019m available in June.\u201d He later added, \u201cI will also entertain offers from Amazon.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "For 25 years, \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d has been taking children on educational adventures, teaching them problem-solving skills and words from new languages.",
      "Known for her pink shirt, purple backpack, interactive map and sidekick monkey Boots, the fearless little girl has become an icon in the world of children\u2019s storytelling.",
      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d premiered on Aug. 14, 2000, running for eight seasons and quickly became one of the most-watched preschool shows. For over two decades, Dora has crossed social, racial and language barriers, seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+ around the globe and through syndication, according to Nickelodeon.",
      "Not only beloved by many kids and families, the show is also critically acclaimed. Over the years, it's received countless accolades, including an Emmy, Peabody, ALMA, NAACP awards and Television Critics Association awards, among others. She also became the first Latina character to be featured as a giant balloon in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2005.",
      "Dora's impact has exceeded creators' Chris Gifford and Valerie Walsh Valdes' expectations, they tell TODAY.com. And for the actors who've been able to embody the dynamic bilingual Dora, they add that it's been an honor and a source of pride.",
      "Dora's Origin Story",
      "The creators say they worked with little kids in an attempt to figure out who Dora was.",
      "\u201cThere were a couple of iterations before Dora was Dora. She was Tess. She was almost a motion capture. She had a little mouse that was Boots that lived in her pocket,\u201d Walsh Valdes tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut there were some things that stayed the same throughout, like the essence of her character. We tried to hold on to that.\u201d",
      "Gifford adds that originally Dora was not Latina. They had first toyed with the idea of the lead character being a cat, a bunny or a little red-headed girl.",
      "\u201cAnd when Nickelodeon came to us with this idea of like, \u2018Could you make (the character) Latina?\u2019 Our first reaction was, \u2018Oh, boy, what a great idea!\u2019\u201d he says, noting the growing Latino population in the U.S. \u201cAnd the representation is not there on air.\u201d",
      "The two and their teams recall bringing in Latino writers, cultural content supervisors like Carlos Cort\u00e9s, experts in language, in music and dance, as well as traveling to Latin America to immerse themselves in the culture.",
      "They noted that when they connected with \u201cseasoned writer\u201d Eric Weiner, he brought on a whole new perspective.",
      "\u201cAnd in doing that, I think that\u2019s when the character came to be who she was,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cBecause it was about using a second language to make friends, to solve problems, to build bridges.\u201d",
      "When the pilot came out, Walsh Valdes and Gifford shared it with a group of children to get their reactions.",
      "\u201cThey went bonkers,\u201d Walsh Valdes recalls. \u201cWhen the executives saw kids screaming and shouting and playing backpack and stuff, all resistance melted away.\u201d",
      "The Many Iterations of Dora the Explorer",
      "Over the years, a number of talented stars have been given the opportunity to voice and bring the character to life in live-action film adaptations.",
      "At just 7 years old, Kathleen Herles became the first Dora as she voiced the character from 2000 to 2007. She returned to the franchise in the new 2024 iteration \u201cDora,\u201d this time as the little girl\u2019s mom, Mami.",
      "As she told TODAY in 2024, returning to the franchise \u2014 and this time as Dora\u2019s mom \u2014 was \u201ca full-circle moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cDora was such a big part of my childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional to even have the opportunity to do this. I feel so blessed and it\u2019s amazing to see Diana (Zerme\u00f1o) take on such an iconic role.\u201d",
      "The new voice of Dora, Diana Zerme\u00f1o, also told TODAY that she grew up watching \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d because when she was younger, she didn\u2019t speak a lot of English.",
      "\u201cSo it was really nice to have a show where the main character also spoke Spanish and I didn\u2019t have to put the dubbing on,\u201d the young actor said.",
      "There\u2019s also been a slew of spin-offs, including \u201cGo, Diego! Go!\u201d which follows Dora\u2019s cousin, Diego, and his friend, Jaguar, as well as \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d",
      "Dora has even taken over the big screen in the 2019 live-action \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold,\u201d starring Isabela Merced as 16-year-old Dora. Eva Longoria, Eugenio Derbez, Michael Pe\u00f1a and Danny Trejo co-starred.",
      "\u201cDora, to me, is iconic. She represents all of Latin America. I\u2019m really proud of my work in the movie because,\u201d Merced tells TODAY.com about her experience. \u201cI remember what headspace I was in, I was just having fun. And that, to me, is what Dora is.\u201d",
      "The 24-year-old actor adds that Dora reminds \u201cpeople to be young and have curiosity. She\u2019s an explorer, she has curiosity. That\u2019s what Dora taught me: to ask questions, and always be on the lookout to make the most out of every situation.\u201d",
      "Most recently, the Latina heroine was brought to life by Samantha Lorraine in the new live-action film, \u201cDora and the Search for Sol Dorado,\u201d which debuted July 2 on Paramount+ and Nickelodeon.",
      "The film, now streaming, once again sees 16-year-old Dora, her older cousin Diego (Jacob Rodriguez), and friends trek through the dangerous Amazonian jungle, searching for the ancient treasure of Sol Dorado and preventing it from falling into enemy hands.",
      "Lorrain tells TODAY.com that she grew up watching \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d \u201cwhich is such a fantastic thing to say out loud and realize where we are in this moment.\u201d",
      "She remembers \u201chaving my Dora shirt on\u201d and watching the show.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who I would be if I didn\u2019t watch it because it\u2019s so significant,\u201d Lorrain says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge part of my life, and I\u2019m so grateful for that.\u201d",
      "Breaking Barriers With Representation and Dora's Lasting Message",
      "\u201cThere was never a moment that I didn\u2019t know Dora in some way, shape or form,\u201d actor Jacob Rodriguez, who portrays Diego in the \u201cSearch for Sol Dorado,\u201d says.",
      "And for many newer generations that is true. With 25 years of Dora, kids who grew up watching \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d are now sharing the show with their children.",
      "\u201cThis is maybe the third generation of \u2018Dora\u2019 fans. There\u2019s been so many kids who\u2019ve gone through this, and now young adults are having their own kids, and they\u2019re becoming \u2018Dora\u2019 fans,\u201d says Walsh Valdes. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we learned in research this time around. It\u2019s like being a proud parent. I\u2019m so happy that this gets to continue and spread.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., as a Latina, Spanish is seen as her \u201csuperpower,\u201d Gifford says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seen as a way to problem solve, as a way to make friends, as a way to build bridges and achieve your goals,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important and I think it sends a really good message.\u201d",
      "While Dora's Spanish lessons are known in the U.S., Doras around the world teach English. Still, the message of adventure, friendship and authenticity stays the same.",
      "\u201cSomehow that little girl resonated in a really strong way, and continues to in all the different iterations that Dora takes. There\u2019s something timeless about that,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cI think it has to do with being open to all people. There\u2019s an acceptance that Dora shows. She\u2019s always true to who she is.\u201d",
      "The creators add that there are so many universals to Dora, \u201ccertainly bilingualism in other parts of the world is very accepted.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeeing a character move between two languages isn\u2019t so unusual for them,\u201d Walsh Valdes notes. \u201cBut having that magic backpack... was a game changer.\u201d",
      "The love for Dora may be universal and for the creators and stars, they have felt it deeply.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I understood the impact and the importance of the show as a kid as much as I do now,\u201d Herles told TODAY. \u201cTo hear everyone\u2019s stories of their memories of the show, with tears in their eyes and telling me how much they loved the show, how much the show meant, it really brings a new perspective to what I did and what I brought to life.\u201d",
      "Dora will always be needed, the creators say, explaining, \u201cShe is so loving and accepting and she really connects with the viewer and listens to the viewer.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cWith all the noise out there, she is a break from that, and it makes a little kid feel like they\u2019re heard, they\u2019re special.\u201d"

    "summary": "Russia's Vladimir Putin said President Donald Trump is making \"sincere\" efforts to end the war in Ukraine ahead of their summit in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers \"to inform you about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration \"is making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

      "LONDON \u2014 A new book touting explosive revelations about the life of Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew has left the embattled duke facing a renewed wave of damaging headlines.",
      "The unauthorized biography, \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York\" by Andrew Lownie, was published Thursday.",
      "It centers on Andrew\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and covers his finances and dealings with foreign governments, as well as the timeline of his ties with Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 the late financier and convicted sex offender who has been the subject of fervent attention in both Britain and the United States in recent weeks.",
      "NBC royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said Thursday that the good news for Andrew and the royal family may be that the impact of this renewed focus will be blunted by the reality that his reputation is already at \u201crock bottom.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible other people might well be taking some of the heat off Andrew,\u201d she said, referring to politicians in the U.S.",
      "Publisher HarperCollins says Lownie, a historian, drew on four years of research and interviews with more than 100 people who haven\u2019t spoken before in writing the 448-page book. The majority spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Excerpts have been splashed across Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, and a poll released this week found that two-thirds of Britons want the disgraced younger brother of King Charles III to be stripped of his remaining royal titles.",
      "An earlier YouGov survey found Andrew remains by far the most unpopular royal, with just 5% of respondents saying they held a positive view of him.",
      "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, formerly known as Meghan Markle, was one place above Andrew, at 20%, with heir to the throne Prince William topping the rankings on 74%.",
      "A representative for Andrew and Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment about both the book and the polling.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.",
      "He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died by suicide in April this year, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court ruled that Andrew had been \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with Yang Tengbo as it lifted an anonymity order protecting Tengbo's identity. Tengbo had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K.",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "His public standing has remained little changed since a disastrous interview about his ties to Epstein on the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight\u201d program in November 2019.",
      "Despite this simmering anger and growing pressure, McAndrew said she doesn't think the king will take the drastic step of removing Andrew's royal titles. But, she said, William might act differently when he ascends the throne.",
      "\"He\u2019s much less sentimental as a personality. And the royal family (and future monarch peculiarly) ultimately must exist to protect the monarchy,\" she said.",
      "The royal family will have to consider whether taking new action against Andrew could run the risk of him retaliating publicly. They may feel it is better, McAndrew said, \"to let sleeping dogs lie.\""

    "summary": "Arab governments that have been advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their response to the suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war.",
    "story": [
      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "\u201cJD Vance Netflix password is \u2018password,\u2019\u201d said one handmade sign at a protest near where the Vances are vacationing some 100 miles west of the capital, London.",
      "A second sign declared that Vance \u201cclaps when the plane lands,\u201d referring to a practice mocked by some Britons who see it as very un-British overenthusiasm. Others held placards quoting Vance when he said he \u201cnever liked\u201d President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cCotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,\u201d another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year\u2019s presidential race.",
      "In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance\u2019s motorcade.",
      "Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was \u201cgetting bored\u201d with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by \u201ca disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.\u201d",
      "Nestled among the rolling hills that rise up from meadows of the upper River Thames, the Cotswolds\u2019 picture-postcard towns and villages have been popular with holidaymakers for centuries.",

      "But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \u201cillicit international trafficking,\u201d claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How it was found",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth.",
      "It was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private galley in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.",
      "Why Niger is investigating",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger\u2019s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite\u2019s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \u201cakin to illicit international trafficking.\u201d",
      "Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \u201cprecious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide\u201d in an effort to ensure their traceability.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement sent to The Associated Press the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.",
      "\u201cAs with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\u201d the statement read.",
      "Authorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.",
      "What international law says",
      "Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 rare minerals, like meteorites, can qualify as cultural property.",
      "However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\u201d she told the AP.",
      "Paul Sereno, a paleontologist who has spent years uncovering dinosaur fossils in Niger\u2019s Sahara, is campaigning to return the country\u2019s cultural and natural heritage \u2014 including meteorites.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not in the colonial area anymore,\u201d he added.",
      "Some countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks."

Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "A man accused of faking his own death and fleeing the United States to avoid sexual assault allegations was convicted of rape in Utah on Wednesday, prosecutors said.",
      "A Salt Lake County jury found Nicholas Alahverdian, who has been identified and charged by authorities in Utah as Nicholas Rossi, guilty after three days of testimony. Deliberations began on Wednesday.",
      "He will be sentenced on Oct. 20, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office said. He faces five years to life in prison.",
      "\"We are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place,\" Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a statement. \"We appreciate her patience as we worked to bring the defendant back to Salt Lake County so that this trial could take place and she could get justice. It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Alahverdian's defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.",
      "Alahverdian faces a second rape trial in nearby Utah County scheduled for September.",
      "In 2022 \u2014 two years after an online obituary stated that Alahverdian died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2014 Alahverdian was arrested in Scotland under the name Arthur Knight.",
      "Speaking with a British accent and appearing in a wheelchair, he denied that he was Alahverdian and claimed that he was an Irish orphan who had become a businessman.",
      "In his opening statement, the prosecutor in the Salt Lake County case said that Alahverdian admitted his true identity under oath last year. He accused Alahverdian of raping a 24-year-old woman in 2008 after a whirlwind romance and engagement.",
      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",
      "Alahverdian\u2019s defense lawyer, MacKenzie Potter, compared the allegations to an \u201cold puzzle from the thrift store,\u201d saying that \u201cnot all the pieces are there.\u201d",
      "The victim\u2019s story had changed over time, Potter said, and it can\u2019t be verified.",
      "Alahverdian, who was raised in Rhode Island\u2019s foster youth system and later became an outspoken aide in that state\u2019s legislature, was previously accused or convicted in other assault and sex crimes cases involving women with whom he was in relationships.",
      "In a case in Massachusetts in 2010, a woman he was married to at the time told authorities he held her down, grabbed her neck, struck her in the face, and refused to let her leave their home following an argument over a crying baby.",
      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

Putin has described the fall of the USSR as a historic tragedy, and believes the Baltic states, which are now members of the E.U. and NATO, should be brought back within his sphere of influence.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s calls are a show of European unity behind Ukraine and other Russian neighbors who fear its next move. E.U. leaders will hold separate telephone discussions before and after the call with Trump, the latter including Canada, indicating the level of coordination between them.",
      "European powers say that there must be a ceasefire before peace talks can begin \u2014 something rejected by Russia \u2014 and that negotiations cannot happen without Ukraine.

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",

      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report after months of delay Tuesday. The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "Frustrated by the bloodshed, pressure is mounting on the United States and the international community to take better control of chaotic food distribution sites.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing not only divisiveness, but hatred between us, and that\u2019s not a good thing for the future,\u201d said Rabbi Erez Sherman of Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. \u201cSo how do we not solve it? How do we work on that?\u201d",
      "But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians.",
      "\u201cIsrael has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that\u2019s really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinian civilians who have been caught in the crossfire throughout this entire war because of Hamas\u2019 actions should not be suffering,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week.",
      "At least 859 people have been killed near sites operated by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, a controversial American- and Israeli-backed organization, the United Nations said.",
      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in a rally organized by IfNotNow, a group that opposes the war in Gaza Strip, in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",
      "\u201cIt says anyone who has the power to speak out and chooses not to do so is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization, said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",

      "Advanced units have pushed farther into Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region, creating two narrow, 10-mile prongs near the battlefield hot spot town of Pokrovsk, according to watchdogs including Ukraine's Deep State and Washington's Institute for the Study of War, two of the top open-source teams tracking the war's battlefield developments.",
      "Expert observers supportive or at least sympathetic to Kyiv are deeply worried that these forays could expand into a full-scale breakthrough for the Kremlin. Already claiming he is winning this war, and refusing to stop fighting unless Ukraine surrenders, Putin could use such a development to lobby for an even more favorable peace deal in Alaska.",
      "\u201cGuys. We are in trouble here,\u201d Rima Ziuraitis, an American enlisted as a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces, posted to X. \u201cWhile Putin and Trump keep everyone distracted, Russia has broken through our lines in Pokrovsk. The situation is critical.\u201d",
      "Though small, the Russian breakthroughs represent a far quicker land grab than either side has managed in months. The concern for Ukraine is that Russia would be able to expand outward into poorly defended parts of Donetsk. The advance may have also cut off a crucial resupply highway to Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfortress\u201d city of Kramatorsk, according to those watching the troop movements.",

      "The next 24-48 hours will likely be \u201ccrucial\u201d in whether Ukraine is able to stanch the Russian advance before Moscow reinforces these advanced units, he posted to X earlier. \u201cClearly the Ukrainians have a crisis on their hands,\u201d he wrote.",

      "It added that he \u201cprimarily shipped eastern box turtles and three-toed box turtles, native U.S. species which feature colorful markings \u2014 a prized feature in the domestic and foreign pet market, particularly in China and Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "The creatures are also in high demand in Asian markets like  mainland China and Thailand, where people consider turtles from other countries and continents as desirable exotic pets, according to the Association for Asian Studies.",
      "Both are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).",
      "The animals Lin smuggled from mid-2023 to late 2024 were valued at $1.4 million, the Department of Justice said.",
      "Lin faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000 or twice the gain or loss from the illegal activity when he is sentenced on Dec. 23, according to the DOJ.",
      "\u201cAs part of his plea, Lin also agreed to abandon any property interest in the reptiles seized during the investigation,\u201d the department said.",
      "In a similar case in March, another Chinese national, Sai Keung Tin, also known as Ricky Tin, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for smuggling more than 2,100 eastern box turtles, the DOJ said at the time.",
      "The animals were also hidden in socks and packed in boxes labeled as almonds and chocolate cookies. Authorities estimated at the time that each turtle could have been sold for $2,000, bringing the total value of the smuggled reptiles to $4.2 million."

      "The choice of Alaska for talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is being seen as symbolic by some Russian commentators, who are framing it as a nod to historic ties and a chance for closer relations in future.",
      "It appears that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not been invited to the summit about the war in his homeland and representatives from Europe have also been excluded, fueling Kyiv\u2019s worst fears that its future might be decided without its input.",
      "But Moscow\u2019s media and political elite have praised the choice of venue \u2014 a territory the United States purchased from the then-Russian Empire 158 years ago \u2014 framing it as a reminder that the U.S. and Russia are geographically close to one another and suggesting it could strengthen relations between the two nations.",
      "\u201cRussia and the United States are close neighbors, bordering each other,\u201d Putin\u2019s aide on foreign affairs, Yuri Ushakov, said on in an audio message shared by the Kremlin on Telegram last week.",
      "Russia's former ambassador to the U.S. added that it seemed \u201cquite logical for our delegation to simply fly across the Bering Strait and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held specifically in Alaska.\u201d",
      "Vladimir Dzhabarov, a Russian senator, also called the location \u201cvery wise,\u201d in an interview Tuesday with the state-owned news channel Russia24. He added that it was \u201cvery far from Ukraine,\u201d which is around 5,000 miles away, and \u201cvery far from, unfortunately, Europe, which is now largely hostile to us.\u201d",
      "Russian commentators also praised the choice of Alaska.",
      "Among them is Alexander Bobrov, who in an editorial for the state-controlled Russian broadcaster RT on Monday wrote that the summit was \u201cmore than just a meeting between two leaders,\u201d and a \u201creturn to the logic of direct dialogue without intermediaries.\u201d",
      "The summit in Alaska \u2014 where Russian Orthodox churches still dot the landscape and names of places such as Nikolaevsk and Voznesensk speak to their shared history \u2014 could help build ties across the Bering Strait, which separates the two countries, Bobrov said.",
      "\u201cAlaska\u2019s story began as Russian, continued as American \u2014 and now has the chance to become a shared chapter, if both sides choose to see it as an opportunity rather than a threat,\u201d he added, referring to Russia's sale of Alaska to the U.S. in 1867 for $7.2 million to avoid losing the territory to Britain and to raise funds.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment about Russian praise for Alaska.",
      "While the state invokes a historic cooperation between the two nations, Ukraine and Europe have urged both superpowers to include Kyiv in any discussions to end the war.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that any decisions taken without Ukraine were \u201cdecisions against peace,\u201d adding, \u201cThey will not achieve anything.\u201d",
      "Asked Monday if the Ukrainian president was invited to the Alaska summit, Trump said Zelenskyy \u201cwasn\u2019t a part of it\u201d and while he had participated in numerous meetings during the course of the war, little had come of them.",
      "\u201cI would say he could go, but he\u2019s gone to a lot of meetings. You know, he\u2019s been there for three and a half years \u2014 nothing happened,\u201d Trump added.",
      "European leaders, meanwhile, are set to hold a videoconference Wednesday to coordinate negotiations to end the war ahead of a separate call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a spokesperson for the German government told Reuters on Tuesday.",
      "Sidelined from the Trump-Putin tete-a-tete, a joint statement by European Union leaders Sunday welcomed Trump\u2019s efforts \"towards ending Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine,\u201d but stressed that \u201ca path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.",
      "The Kremlin\u2019s larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at a great cost in troops, while it bombards Ukrainian cities.",
      "Overnight into Tuesday, Russian drone strikes killed two civilians and injured 13 more across multiple Ukrainian regions, officials in the country said."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has agreed to once again delay the deadline when tariffs on Chinese imports would rise as discussions between the two sides continue.",
      "The new deadline would be Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cAll other elements of the Agreement will remain the same,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In a statement accompanying an executive order, the White House said the administration would be holding \u201congoing negotiations\u201d with China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, to \u201cresolve trade disputes and strengthen economic ties.\u201d",
      "\u201cEach round of negotiations with the Chinese has built on each other, further strengthening economic cooperation,\u201d the White House added.",
      "A joint government statement carried by Chinese state media said China would adopt and maintain all necessary measures to suspend or remove non-tariff measures.",
      "For companies and consumers, another pause means continued uncertainty as President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff regime enters its fifth month.",
      "Last week, import taxes went into effect for dozens of countries. Prices have ticked up in the United States while existing tariffs on imports from China and others work their way into the economy, with companies eating much of the higher costs and consumers absorbing some. Trump has downplayed inflation concerns and lauded the tens of billions of dollars in federal revenue from the levies.",
      "This is the second time the Trump administration has delayed imposing even higher tariffs on China, which is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners. In 2024, the United States imported more than $438 billion worth of Chinese goods, including everything from clothing to electronics to toys.",
      "While there is no deal in hand, there has been movement on a few fronts. Just days ago, Trump authorized American tech companies Nvidia and AMD to resume selling some of their artificial intelligence semiconductors to China. China has also reportedly eased some restrictions on exports of rare earth metals. Those were key issues for both sides.",
      "Trump\u2019s back-and-forth with China over tariffs started just days after he re-entered office. In early February, he imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China, which quickly retaliated with higher tariffs of its own. Then, on April 2, Trump said he would slap a 34% tariff on China.",
      "A week later, after China hiked its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, Trump said on Truth Social: \u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.\u201d That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to a total of 145% versus 125% in Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods, amounting to a mutual trade embargo.",
      "Seeking to defuse the tension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva in early May. Following those talks, both countries lowered their tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, to 30% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. goods.",
      "Just weeks later, Trump said on Truth Social that \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\u201d U.S. officials later said that China was \u201cslow rolling\u201d the delivery of rare earths.",
      "Bessent and Greer met again with their counterparts, namely Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, in London in mid-June. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also joined those talks, which yielded positive language.",
      "\u201cThe two largest economies in the world have reached a handshake for a framework,\u201d Lutnick said at the conclusion of the London talks. Since that meeting, the details of that framework agreement have not been released or published by either government.",
      "A full-fledged trade deal with China remains elusive despite at least seven days of face-to-face talks this year between high- ranking officials on both sides.",
      "\u201cBeijing will be happy to keep the U.S.-China negotiation going, but it is unlikely to make concessions,\u201d said William Yang, a senior Northeast Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group who is based in Taiwan.",
      "\u201cChina believes momentum is on its side because Trump has a stronger desire to sign a deal with Beijing so that he can claim victory and secure a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the fall,\u201d Yang said.",
      "Such a summit could take place around the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, which both leaders might attend."
