      "The new action-sports league being launched by Shaun White will air on NBC and stream on Peacock beginning next year.",
      "White announced earlier this year that he was putting together The Snow League, a four-stop circuit that will feature halfpipe snowboarding and freeskiing. On Tuesday, the league and NBC revealed that the first event is set for March 7-8 in Aspen, with the rest of the schedule still to be announced.",
      "White plans on getting 20 men and 16 women in each contest for a prize pool of more than $1.5 million over the first season. A list of athletes who have committed to the league is expected later this year.",
      "The debut in Aspen will come 11 months before the start of the Winter Olympics in Italy, also set to be carried by NBC and its streaming service, Peacock.",
      "White, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who retired after the 2022 Games in Beijing, said a key reason for starting the league was to bring together the world's top action-sports stars, who often divide time between a number of circuits, including the Dew Tour and stops on the Grand Prix and X Games tours.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we really want to be that premier thing, where it\u2019s amazing to go to the Olympics and win a medal, but this is like winning Wimbledon or the NBA finals. It\u2019s almost more prestigious,\u201d White said in an interview earlier this year.",

      "Nearly 35 years after the Pixies enlisted the late Steve Albini for their 1988 debut studio album \u201cSurfer Rosa,\u201d bassist Kim Deal reunited with the acclaimed audio engineer before his death for another debut \u2014 eight of the 11 tracks on Deal\u2019s first sol...",
      "When the Pixies set out to make their 1988 debut studio album, they enlisted Steve Albini to engineer \u201cSurfer Rosa,\u201d the seminal alternative record which includes the enduring hit, \u201cWhere Is My Mind?\u201d That experience was mutually beneficial to both parties \u2014 and was the beginning of a decades-long friendship between the prickly Albini and Kim Deal, the band\u2019s bassist at the time.",
      "Nearly 35 years later \u2014 and just before the acclaimed audio engineer died in May at age 61 \u2014 Deal turned to Albini once again for what would be their final collaboration, this time for another debut. Eight of the 11 tracks on Deal\u2019s first solo studio album, \u201cNobody Loves You More,\" were produced by both Albini and Deal \u2014 the ideal partnership of his experimentation and her musical skill.",
      "Deal\u2019s music has always been a reflection of both the rugged exterior needed to be a woman at the forefront of the '90s alternative rock scene as well as a tenderness that subverts the indifference often characterizing that same scene.",
      "Those features, ostensibly at odds with one another, culminate in \u201cNobody Loves You More,\u201d thanks to her poignant lyricism and the unique instrumentation woven throughout the record. At its heart, this is still a rock album \u2014 one that Deal is uniquely suited to make.",
      "The album\u2019s final track, \u201cA Good Time Pushed,\u201d musically and lyrically captures the fine line between doom and joy. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d she repeats, in what is perhaps an effort to convince herself that she is.",
      "Although the continuity is there between this album and the music of the Pixies and Deal's band The Breeders, aspects of it are unequivocally distinct.",
      "The resounding brass instruments on the title track and \u201cCoast,\u201d along with the orchestra featured on \u201cSummerland,\" are a departure from the traditional rock instrumentation that many listeners have come to associate with the 63-year-old.",
      "As the album title suggests, much of the songs on \u201cNobody Loves You More\u201d are also lyrically earnest and romantic. \u201cAre you mine?/Are you my baby?/I have no mind/For nothin but love,\u201d Deal croons on the doo-wop-inspired \u201cAre You Mine?\u201d",
      "There are anomalies \u2014 like in the drum- and synth-heavy \u201cBig Ben Beat,\u201d which is evocative of rocker Kim Gordon\u2019s electronic pivot in 2024's \u201cThe Collective.\" That one was produced only by Deal, not Albini.",
      "As a whole, \u201cNobody Loves You More\u201d is varied \u2014 and as distinctly American as the myriad locations which inspired it, from the Massachusetts island of Nantucket (the breezy sounds of \u201cCoast\u201d) to the Florida Keys (\"Summerland\") to Deal's hometown of Dayton, Ohio.",
      "Fans of the Pixies and the Breeders will find a lot to enjoy here \u2014 it is both familiar and different.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge ordered prosecutors Tuesday not to use papers taken from the jail cell of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs until he rules on defense claims that they are trial preparation materials protected by attorney-client privilege.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian made his ruling at a Manhattan federal court hearing after lawyers fiercely disputed the circumstances and relevance of the seizure of 19 pages that were photographed by an investigator inside the cell of the music mogul.",
      "Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, is accused of coercing and abusing women for years with the aid of a network of associates and employees.",
      "The seizure came during what the government has described as a multi-day sweep of all cells at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, intended to remove any weapons or contraband as an anti-violence measure.",
      "Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said he may ask the judge to dismiss the indictment or force a recusal of prosecutors if the judge rules that the materials were obtained and used improperly.",
      "Combs, who hugged his lawyers when he first entered the courtroom, carried a stack of papers as he was led away at the end of the hearing.",
      "Agnifilo said he was unaware that the papers in Combs' cell had been photographed by an investigator with the Bureau of Prisons and turned over to prosecutors until he saw them cited in written arguments opposing his $50 million bail proposal. A bail hearing is set for Friday.",
      "He said two references to the papers were made as prosecutors argued that Combs has continued to commit crimes since his September arrest.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs orchestrated social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool, tried to publicly leak materials he thought would be helpful to his case and contacted potential witnesses through third parties.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Slavik said the seized materials were scrutinized by independent government lawyers who are walled off from the prosecution to determine if they were protected by attorney-client privilege.",
      "They were not discussed with defense lawyers because some of them were deemed to pertain to a covert and continuing investigation of Combs, she said.",
      "Slavik also said prosecutors had no contact with jail officials beforehand and gave no instructions regarding any search of Combs' cell.",
      "Some of the photographed pages contained a to-do list and inspirational quotes along with comments about birthdays, according to Slavik, while two excerpts pertained to Combs paying and finding damaging material about potential witnesses.",
      "Agnifilo said, however, that even things that seem unrelated to the case are protected by attorney-client privilege. For instance, he said, attorneys have discussed with Combs prospective witnesses they might call.",
      "\u201cEvery single thing\u201d in the seized papers is subject to attorney-client privilege because Combs discussed them with lawyers, Agnifilo said.",
      "\u201cThe government now knows potential defense witnesses for a May 5 trial,\u201d he added. \u201cThis has been a complete government failure.\u201d",
      "The judge asked each side to submit written arguments in the coming weeks."

      "Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. He said his father died at a Tokyo hospital due to old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a bestseller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad,\" a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children, and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "In his prose poem with that title, in which a boy is opening a Coke can, he wrote: \u201cIf, for instance, he saw the infinite universe that started or ended at the tip of his can, he was totally unaware of it. One might be able to opine that he named every bit of the unknown about to swallow him with all the vocabulary he could muster, which included his future vocabulary that was yet dormant in his subconscious.\u201d",
      "In his debut poem that catapulted him to stardom, he is more sparse:",
      "\u201cBecause the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,\u201d is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.",
      "When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

    "summary": "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook &ldquo;Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,&rdquo; has died",
    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "story": [
      "After almost a year of testimony, prosecutors in Atlanta rested their case against the two remaining defendants in a gang and racketeering trial that had included rapper Young Thug before he pleaded guilty",
      "ATLANTA -- After almost a year of testimony in a sweeping gang and racketeering indictment against Young Thug and an initial other 27 defendants, prosecutors rested their case Tuesday in the longest trial in Georgia's history.",
      "Both Deamonte Kendrick, also known as Yak Gotti, and Shannon Stillwell told the judge Tuesday they would not testify in their own defense. Both earlier rejected plea offers after over a week of negotiation.",
      "Defense lawyers indicated that they would ask Fulton County Superior Court Judge Paige Reese Whitaker to direct the jury to issue a verdict of not guilty against Kendrick and Stillwell on Wednesday, which requires the lawyers to argue that no reasonable person could find that the state had proved Kendrick and Stillwell guilty.",
      "If Whitaker rejects the request for a directed verdict, lawyers are also likely Wednesday to argue about instructions to jurors about what they must find to convict Kendrick and Stillwell.",
      "Jurors will return on Thursday and could begin deliberation before the end of the week.",
      "Young Thug, the 33-year-old Atlanta-born Grammy winning artist whose given name is Jeffery Williams, pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges in October after negotiations with prosecutors broke down. That left the sentence up to Whitaker, who let him walk free by sentencing him to time served and 15 years of probation with hefty restrictions, including a ban from the metro Atlanta area for the first 10 years except for certain occasions.",
      "The slow-moving trial has been fraught with problems from the start. Jury selection took nearly 10 months, and Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville, the original judge, was removed from the case in July after defense attorneys filed a recusal motion based on a secretive meeting he held with prosecutors and a state witness.",
      "Whitaker took over the case and often lost patience with prosecutors for what she once called \u201cpoor lawyering.\u201d She and defense attorneys scolded prosecutors for not sharing evidence in advance.",
      "More than 175 witnesses testified throughout the trial. Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others co-founded a violent criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they say is affiliated with the national Bloods gang.",
      "At Young Thug's plea hearing, defense attorney Brian Steel said that Young Thug was \u201cfalsely accused\" and the evidence against him was weak. He also condemned the use of rap lyrics during the trial.",
      "Steel said he thought they were winning the trial and wanted to stick it out to a jury verdict, but Young Thug wanted to go home to his family instead of sitting through the rest of the trial, which felt like \u201chell.\u201d",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including Atlanta rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Twelve others are to be tried separately. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case."

      "Australian writer Richard Flanagan has won Britain\u2019s leading nonfiction book prize, a decade after being awarded the Booker Prize for fiction",
      "LONDON -- Australian writer Richard Flanagan completed an unprecedented literary double on Tuesday, winning Britain\u2019s leading nonfiction book prize a decade after being awarded the Booker Prize for fiction.",
      "Flanagan was awarded the 50,000 pound ($63,000) Baillie Gifford Prize for his genre-bending memoir \u201cQuestion 7,\u201d which combines autobiography, family history and the story of the development of the atomic bomb.",
      "Flanagan won the Booker Prize in 2014 for \u201cThe Narrow Road to the Deep North,\u201d a novel that drew on his father\u2019s experiences as a World War II prisoner of the Japanese military.",
      "Baillie Gifford Prize director Toby Mundy said that for the same writer to win the leading U.K.-based fiction and nonfiction awards was \u201ccompletely unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Journalist Isabel Hilton, who chaired the judging panel, said Flanagan had written a \u201cmeditative symphony of a book\u201d that weaves together \u201cenormous traumatic events of the 20th century \u2026 with an extraordinary personal narrative.\u201d",
      "Hilton said Flanagan\u2019s fiction background was evident in the book\u2019s inventiveness and \u201cnarrative beat.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the book benefitted from that novelist\u2019s eye,\u201d she said.",
      "Flanagan was not on hand to receive the trophy in person at a ceremony in London. Organizers said he was trekking in the Tasmanian rainforest.",
      "In a recorded message, Flanagan called the threat from climate change existential, and said he wouldn't accept the prize money unless the finance firm that sponsors the prize draws up a plan to end its investments in fossil fuel companies.",
      "Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford has faced protests from environmental groups over its investments in fossil fuel businesses and firms linked to Israel\u2019s defense sector. Amid the controversy, the company stopped sponsoring several British book festivals, including one of the lagrest, the Edinburgh International Book Festival.",
      "That has prompted a backlash from others in the culture world, who say it starves the arts of much-needed funding.",
      "Baillie Gifford partner Peter Singlehurst criticized the campaigners\u2019 demands, saying \u201cpurity is illusory.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is being demanded is something we cannot do,\u201d he told attendees at the ceremony. \u201cThe literary community must either accept us as they find us, or not at all.\u201d",
      "Mundy said the nonfiction prize hoped to renew Baillie Gifford\u2019s sponsorship, which ends in 2026.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been exemplary sponsors and I think exemplary supporters of the literary culture of this country,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- The former members of One Direction reunited Wednesday for the funeral of bandmate Liam Payne.",
      "Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson joined friends and family at the service for 31-year-old Payne, who died after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last month.",
      "A horse-drawn carriage carried the coffin to St. Mary\u2019s Church in Amersham, 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of London. Undertakers carried the dark blue casket with silver handles, topped with white roses, into the 800-year-old church for the private service.",
      "The funeral location was not made public in advance to prevent a large crowd from gathering, though dozens of local people and fans still gathered nearby.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I was a massive fan of One Direction, so I almost felt like a little piece of the child in me was gone,\" said 20-year-old Tara Lloyd, who works at the nearby Amersham Hospital.",
      "The crowd fell silent when Payne\u2019s parents, Geoff and Karen, emerged from a car to stand beside the carriage, which was topped with floral tributes reading \u201cSon\u201d and \u201cDaddy.\u201d Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear, with the singer Cheryl Tweedy.",
      "Among the mourners was Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy, actor and presenter James Corden, former soccer player Robbie Keane and music mogul Simon Cowell who put One Direction together.",
      "After the service, Cowell embraced Payne\u2019s parents outside the church, before the late singer's coffin was driven away in a black hearse.",
      "One Direction formed in 2010 after the five teenagers auditioned for \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d as solo acts and were brought together by Cowell, a judge on the show. With their loyal fan base of \u201cDirectioners\u201d they became one of the most successful boy bands of all time.",
      "After the group split in 2016, Payne embarked on a solo career which failed to match the success of One Direction. He was also open about struggling with his mental health and alcohol amid the pressures of fame.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina said that Payne had traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system when he fell to his death from the third-floor balcony of his room at the Casa Sur Hotel  in the Argentine capital on Oct. 16. They have charged three people over his death, with \u201cabandonment of a person followed by death\u201d and \u201csupplying and facilitating the use of narcotics.\u201d",

      "The title of Father John Misty's sixth studio album, \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d is a reference to cremation, and the first song proposes \u201ca corpse dance.\u201d Religious overtones mix with the undercurrent of a midlife crisis atop his folk chamber pop. And for those despairing recent events, some lyrics seem topical.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always the darkest right before the end,\u201d Misty sings on \u201cScreamland,\u201d a power ballad full of desperation and overdriven amplifiers. His advice: \u201cStay young, get numb, keep dreaming.\u201d",
      "\u201cScreamland\u201d is one of eight songs on \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d Misty\u2019s jaundiced, smart, cynical, droll, druggy, opaque, arch, theatrical take on life \u2013 and death. The album will be released Friday, Nov. 22.",

      "Misty can be verbose or concise: Three song titles are complete sentences. Incongruous but colorful couplets come in waves, seeking answers while unsure of the question.",
      "Misty frames his wordsmithery in cinematic rock noir arrangements as dense as the lyrics. A marvelous string section underpins the lush sound, darting and swooping amid thundering drums and a pounding piano.",
      "Tempos tend toward slow, matching Misty\u2019s melodrama. But \u201cShe Cleans Up\u201d is delightfully jagged art rock, with slashing guitars and sax, and \u201cI Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All\u201d pairs a sweet groove and sour outlook.

Perfectly played by Thomasin McKenzie, Purdy is both vulnerable and strong, learning through the process to be a better human. James Norton plays Edwards with charm, self-doubt and calm spirit.",

IVF may have become common and uncontroversial over the last decades, but back in the late '70s it was experimental and shunned.

No matter. \u201cThis fight is ours. We don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Purdy says. The film also celebrates the brave would-be mothers who volunteered their bodies to be poked and prodded at the edge of science.",
      "Our hero researchers try to argue to the skeptical world in vain that IVF is simply a way for science to help those in need, like glasses for the shortsighted or dentures for those with teeth decay. It's remarkable to return to this debate now when science's great achievements today may be under threat, like fluoridated water.",
      "Director Ben Taylor keeps the story small and intimate, a series of vignettes adding up to almost like a play. It features moments of quiet and polite bravery, and small conversations over a pint of ale \u2014 a reminder of the power of performances and that changing the world doesn't need a muscle-bound bro with X-ray vision.",
      "It's held together by a superb soundtrack with witty selections like \u201cYes We Can Can\u201d by Lee Dorsey, \u201cNobody But Me\u201d by The Human Beinz and \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d by George Harrison, each song encapsulating the moment in time, like pearls on a strand.",
      "\u201cJoy\u201d is not all joy. There is frustration and loss and tears along the way, but it is a triumphant film about the way humans can make the world better and how a baby's cry can be a priceless gift.",
      "\u201cJoy,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for \u201cthematic material brief strong language, some sexual references and surgery images.\u201d Running time: 115 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

But he's also working to set up a more forceful administration in this term, and in his eyes, many of those people happen to intersect with celebrity.",
      "The trend was not lost on Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, who posted on social media after the Oz nomination: \u201cWe are becoming the world\u2019s first nuclear-armed reality television show.\u201d",
      "For good measure, Himes added: \u201cJust spitballing here, but what if the Attorney General and the Secretary of HHS fight each other in an octagonal cage?\u201d That was a reference to Trump's affinity for the UFC fighters who do battle in the octagon.",
      "Choosing TV personalities isn't that unusual for the once-and-future president: A number of his first-term choices \u2014 John Bolton, Larry Kudlow, Heather Nauert and Mercedes Schlapp, were all on TV \u2014 mostly also on Fox. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a confrontational first-season member of Trump's NBC show \u201cThe Apprentice,\" was briefly at the White House before she was fired.",
      "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who ran Trump\u2019s 2016 transition team until he was fired, said that eight years ago, Trump held \u201cApprentice-like interviews at Bedminster,\u201d summoning potential hires to his club in New Jersey.",
      "On a call on Tuesday organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Christie said this year\u2019s Cabinet choices are different than 2016\u2019s but it\u2019s still \u201cDonald Trump casting a TV show.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s casting,\u201d Christie said.",
      "Trump has readily highlighted the media experience of his choices as he's announced them. He said Duffy, a former lawmaker and onetime cast member of MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World,\" was \u201ca STAR on Fox News.\u201d",
      "Hegseth, a military veteran, \u201chas been a host at FOX News for eight years, where he used that platform to fight for our Military and Veterans,\u201d Trump said. He also noted that Hegseth's book \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d spent nine weeks on The New York Times \u201cbest-sellers list, including two weeks at NUMBER ONE.\u201d",
      "As for Oz, Trump said: \u201cHe won nine Daytime Emmy Awards hosting \u2018The Dr. Oz Show,\u2019 where he taught millions of Americans how to make healthier lifestyle choices.\"",
      "It's also true that those seeking positions in Trump's orbit often take to the airwaves to audition for an audience of one. Tom Homan, Trump's choice for \u201cborder czar,\u201d is a frequent Fox contributor. Ohio Sen. JD Vance was chosen as Trump's running mate in part because of how well he comes across on air.",
      "Trump's choice to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, upped his profile when he took to Fox News to argue that a pre-election appearance on NBC's \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was a violation of the \u201cequal time\u201d rule governing candidate appearances on television.",
      "The White House-to-cable news pundit pipeline tends to cut across administrations of both parties, to some extent. President Joe Biden had three MSNBC contributors on his transition team and his former press secretary went to the network after she left the White House. Biden, though, looked to career diplomats, longtime government workers and military leaders for key posts like the Defense Department.",
      "Trump's affinity for Fox News is well-documented, though the romance cooled for a time after Fox made an early call of Arizona for Biden in 2020, a move that infuriated Trump and many of the network\u2019s viewers. Trump suggested viewers should migrate to other conservative news outlets.",
      "While the Arizona call ultimately proved correct, it set in motion internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "But Trump is still an avid watcher \u2014 the network provides Trump a window into conservative thinking, with commentary from Republican lawmakers and thinkers who are, often, speaking directly to the president-elect.",

      "Comcast will spin off many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, with people increasingly swapping out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast will spin off many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, with people increasingly swapping out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site would also become part of the new company.",
      "Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the potential shift last month as it released quarterly earnings before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over he past 12 months ending September 30. That's about 5.5% of Comcast's total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "But there is a shrinking pool of cable subscribers as millions cut the cord and rely increasingly on streaming platforms for entertainment.",
      "\u201cLike millions of US consumers, Comcast finally cut the cord by divesting itself of most of its cable TV channels,\u201d said Paul Verna, principal analyst at market research company eMarketer. \u201cThe benefits are clear to Comcast. It\u2019s dropping money-losing assets from a technology and media empire that will retain its lucrative (internet service provider) business, theme parks, broadcast networks, and Peacock streaming service.\u201d",
      "But how this new spin-off company will fare independently is less promised, he adds \u2014 pointing again to cable's \u201chemorrhaging subscribers and ad revenues\" overall.",
      "Mark Lazarus, current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group, will serve as the new entity\u2019s chief executive officer. Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "\"As a standalone company with these outstanding assets, we will be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns in this incredibly dynamic media environment across news, sports and entertainment,\" Lazarus said Wednesday.",
      "Comcast expects the new company to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, were essentially flat Wednesday.",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid subscribers to its streaming Peacock channel jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Peacock was launched in 2020, and after a confusing, glitchy start, has taken off recently, boosted in part by the platform\u2019s success and popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.",
      "Peacock streamed all 329 medal events and over 5,000 hours of coverage during the Games, with viewers streaming more than 23 billion minutes of Olympic coverage, led by Peacock. That's a 40% increase over all previous Summer and Winter Olympics combined, Comcast said.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",
      "The company expects to open its Epic Universe theme park in Orlando in May of next year.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cWicked\u201d lovers, prepare your pink outfits \u2013 and your green ones",
      "It\u2019s the ultimate celebrity redemption tour, two decades in the making. In the annals of pop culture, few characters have undergone an image makeover quite like the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Oh, she may have been vengeful and scary in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d But something changed \u2014 like, REALLY changed \u2014 on the way from the yellow brick road to the Great White Way. Since 2003, crowds have packed nightly into \u201cWicked\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Gershwin Theatre to cheer as the green-skinned, misunderstood Elphaba rises up on her broomstick to belt \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d that enduring girl-power anthem.",
      "How many people have seen \u201cWicked\u201d? Rudimentary math suggests more than 15 million on Broadway alone. And now we have \u201cWicked\u201d the movie, director Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish, faithful, impeccably crafted (and nearly three-hour) ode to this origin story of Elphaba and her (eventual) bestie \u2014 Glinda, the very good and very blonde. Welcome to Hollywood, ladies.",
      "Before we get to what this movie does well (Those big numbers! Those costumes!), just a couple thornier issues to ponder. Will this \u201cWicked,\u201d powered by a soulful Cynthia Erivo (owner of one of the best singing voices on the planet) and a sprightly, comedic, hair-tossing Ariana Grande, turn even musical theater haters into lovers?",
      "Tricky question. Some people just don\u2019t buy into the musical thing, and they should be allowed to live freely amongst us. But if people breaking into song delights rather than flummoxes you, if elaborate dance numbers in village squares and fantastical nightclubs and emerald-hued cities make perfect sense to you, and especially if you already love \u201cWicked,\u201d well then, you will likely love this film. If it feels like they made the best \u201cWicked\u201d movie money could buy \u2014 well, it\u2019s because they kinda did.",
      "Much credit for that goes to Chu, who has said he spent so many years working on \u201cWicked\u201d that three of his five children were born during that span. Chu clearly has musical theater in his DNA, as we already knew from \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d His actors don\u2019t break awkwardly into composer Stephen Schwartz\u2019s famous pop-show tunes: they run headlong into them, and sometimes blow the roof off with them.",
      "Another question: Will people be turned off when they see \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d at the end, after two hours and 40 minutes, realizing they must wait a year for Part 2? Also tricky. Surely this COULD have been one movie. But then, how would they have followed \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d which brings down the Act 1 curtain (and the house) in the show? It\u2019s hard to imagine just continuing with the plot.",
      "Yes, the plot: We begin with Grande\u2019s Glinda descending on Munchkinland in her glistening bubble, which since 1939 has been upgraded with a comfy sofa, to announce that, indeed, the wicked witch is dead.",
      "But someone challenges Glinda: Is it true you were her friend? Well, er, yes, Glinda replies carefully. Their paths did cross \u2014 back at school.",
      "Cue opening day at Shiz University. Glinda \u2014 well, for now, Galinda \u201cwith a ga\u201d \u2014 an aspiring sorcery major, arrives in her pink suit looking like mix of Grace Kelly and Elle Woods. She already has a fan base and a private suite.",
      "Also arriving is Elphaba there to help her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode) settle in. The students are horrified at her green skin. But when imperious Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), dean of sorcery at Shiz, gets a glimpse of Elphaba\u2019s unharnessed magical powers, the green girl becomes her prized student.",
      "Elphaba hopes her sorcery lessons will lead to a meeting with the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, whose glorified head is carved into the campus and who, she secretly hopes, will grant her wish to be \u201cde-greenified.\u201d She sings of this wish in \u201cThe Wizard and I,\u201d a lovely number introducing Erivo\u2019s uniquely supple vocals.",
      "Another upbeat number, \u201cWhat is this Feeling?,\" introduces the \u201cloathing, unadulterated loathing\u201d between Elphaba and Glinda, forced to room together. These early songs have a zippy appeal, and the best is \u201cDancing Through Life,\u201d a bang-up dance number that showcases the rakish charm of local prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey of \u201cBridgerton,\u201d dripping with charm) who proudly urges fellow students to join him in his shallowness.",
      "\u201cLife\u2019s more painless, for the brainless,\u201d sings Bailey, accompanied by acrobatic dancers on huge, coordinated \u201ctornado wheels\u201d in a fabulous library. \u201cLife Is fraught less, when you\u2019re thoughtless.\u201d Fiyero will develop into something different in Part 2. For now, he woos Glinda and strikes up a friendship with Elphaba.",
      "But \u201cWicked\u201d is about female friendship, and the sudden, surprising bond between polar opposites Glinda and Elphaba \u2014 chirpy vs. deep, pink-clad vs. black-clad. In the delightful makeover song \u201cPopular,\u201d Galinda's tour de force, Grande swings from the chandelier, kicks like a can-can dancer, and gallivants around a to-die-for bedroom set that includes pink-sequined shoes popping out of nowhere.",
      "Erivo\u2019s tour de force? That would be \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d the show\u2019s huge signature song, coming as the mood has changed into something far more ominous. Both young women are in the Emerald City, where they \u2014 or at least, Elphaba, have discovered that the wizard is not powerful and beneficent, but, more like, well, Jeff Goldblum \u2014 charming and weak, with a big, dark secret.",
      "\u201cSo if you care to find me,\u201d belts out Elphaba, having discovered the power of her broomstick, \u201cLook to the western sky.\u201d Where, exactly, is she going?",
      "Hold that thought. For exactly one year.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d a Universal Studios release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material.\" Running time: 160 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- An Iowa-based group that strives to alleviate world hunger and awards an annual prize honoring individuals for their efforts to improve food availability, on Tuesday announced a leadership change as the group works to expand its international focus.",
      "Mashal Husain, chief operating officer of The World Food Prize Foundation, will become president, replacing Terry Branstad, the former U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa governor, who will retire, the organization announced in a news release.",
      "The food prize was founded by Normal Borlaug, an Iowa native awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his part in the \u201cGreen Revolution,\u201d which dramatically increased agricultural production and reduced the threat of starvation in much of the world.",
      "Husain, who was born in Pakistan and later lived in Tanzania, Thailand and the Philippines, said her international background was in keeping with Borlaug's work and the foundation's efforts to expand its efforts in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world. She has worked at the foundation for 16 years.",
      "\u201cI grew up all over the world and many of these places are places where Normal Borlaug spent a lot of his time, so I feel a deep connection to him,\u201d Husain said in an interview. \u201cHaving lived all over the world, I've witnessed poverty and hunger. I've been surrounded by it since I was a little girl.\u201d",
      "As part of an effort to expand its efforts in other countries, the foundation has created a new chief executive position. The new hire will, among other duties, enhance connections with international leaders in agriculture, food security, nutrition and sustainable development.",

      "The prizewinners speak in the fall at a weeklong gathering of lectures, meetings and networking in Des Moines.",
      "The foundation's work comes as some people are more skeptical about issues surrounding science and food production, but Husain said their work would hew to Borlaug's belief in innovation and promoting big ideas.",
      "\u201cWorld hunger is not a political issue. It's a moral right,\u201d Husain said. \u201cDr. Borlaug always said food is the moral right of those who are born into this world.\u201d"

      "Here's a look at a television doctor who became a politician and is now designated to lead an agency that touches nearly all Americans in some way.",
      "Trained as a heart surgeon, Oz rose to prominence on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before spinning off his own series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\" in 2009.",
      "The program aired for 13 seasons and made Oz a household name.",
      "Oz stopped doing surgeries in 2018 but his physician license remains active in Pennsylvania through the end of this year, according to the state's online database.",
      "Oz is an author of New York Times bestsellers, an Emmy-winning TV show host, radio talk show host, presidential appointee, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.",
      "He also guest hosted the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d game show and helped save a dying man at Newark Liberty International Airport.",

      "He attended a private high school in Delaware and Harvard University as a college undergraduate, also playing football there, and served in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.",
      "Oz dispensed nutritional and lifestyle advice on his show, portraying himself as a trusted doctor capable of explaining health matters in an engaging and approachable way. But his show also blurred the line between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.",
      "He repeatedly promoted products of questionable medical value and was named in lawsuits that alleged he made misleading claims on the show. Several of the companies he has promoted are structured as multilevel marketing businesses whose practices have repeatedly drawn the attention of federal regulators.",
      "Oz had a net worth between $100 million and $315 million, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed in 2022, which gives dollar values in ranges but does not provide specific figures.",
      "Oz ran for U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2022, one of the highest-profile races of that year's midterms. Though he was a longtime resident of New Jersey and worked in New York City, Oz ran in Pennsylvania, citing ties to the state through his wife's parents.",
      "His campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity. Its logo looked just like his TV show logo. His themes \u2014 \u201ca dose of reality\u201d or \u201cthe doctor is in\u201d \u2014 spun off his TV doctor reputation.",
      "He ran in a crowded Republican primary and won Trump's eagerly sought endorsement.",
      "\u201cWomen, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\u201d Trump said when he endorsed Oz.",
      "Following a court battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Oz narrowly won the primary over McCormick by 951 votes but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.",
      "Oz told The Associated Press in a 2022 interview that he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005 when he asked Trump to use his golf course for an event for Oz\u2019s children\u2019s charity. Trump agreed. After that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Oz interviewed Trump about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "In a 2016 appearance on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d Trump said his wife, Melania Trump, was \u201ca big fan\u201d of the show.",
      "Trump appointed Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during his first term.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate to lead CMS, Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid, children\u2019s health insurance and the Affordable Care Act, better known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d The programs cover more than 160 million people, from newborns to nursing home residents.",
      "CMS also plays a central role in the nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion health care economy, setting Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers.

      "Transgender Day of Remembrance is marked every Nov. 20 and began in 1999 to honor Rita Hester, a trans woman who was killed in Massachusetts.",
      "The day marks the end of Transgender Awareness Week, which is used to raise public knowledge about the transgender community and the issues they face.",
      "The Williams Institute at UCLA Law estimates that 1.6 million people in the U.S. ages 13 and older identify as transgender. And it says transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violence, including rape and assault.",

      "At least 36 transgender people have died from violence in the 12 months since the last Day of Remembrance, the Human Rights Campaign said in its annual report. Since 2013, the organization has recorded the deaths from violence of 372 victims who were transgender and gender-expansive \u2014 which refers to someone with a more flexible range of gender identity or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system.",

      "A South Dakota judge has dismissed a lawsuit that an anti-abortion group filed in June targeting an abortion rights measure that voters went on to reject",
      "A South Dakota judge dismissed a lawsuit that an anti-abortion group filed in June targeting an abortion rights measure that voters rejected this month.",
      "In an order dated Friday, Circuit Court Judge John Pekas granted Life Defense Fund's motion to dismiss its lawsuit against Dakotans for Health, the measure group.",
      "In a statement, Life Defense Fund co-chair Leslee Unruh said: \u201cThe people have decided, and South Dakotans overwhelmingly rejected this constitutional abortion measure. We have won in the court of public opinion, and South Dakotans clearly saw the abortion lobby\u2019s deception.\u201d",
      "Dakotans for Health co-founder Rick Weiland said he had expected the lawsuit to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cThe Life Defense Fund\u2019s accusations were part of a broader, failed effort to keep Amendment G off the ballot and silence the voices of South Dakota voters,\u201d Weiland said in a statement. \"But make no mistake \u2014 this dismissal is just one battle in a much larger war over the future of direct democracy in South Dakota.\u201d",
      "Life Defense Fund's lawsuit had challenged petitions that got the measure on the ballot, saying they contained invalid signatures and circulators committed fraud and various wrongdoing. The anti-abortion group sought to invalidate the ballot initiative and bar the measure group and its workers from doing ballot-measure work for four years.",

      "Women's health advocates in Africa are worried that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will again invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that cuts off U.S. government funding for groups that offer abortion-related services",
      "EPWORTH, Zimbabwe -- Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. \u201cI am too young to be a baby-making machine,\" she said. \"At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.\u201d",
      "But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world\u2019s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable.",
      "As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion.",
      "The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced.",
      "As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.",
      "The money \u2014 much of it intended for Africa \u2014 covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention.",
      "Women\u2019s health advocates are \u201cuneasy\u201d following Trump\u2019s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries.",
      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t regained all the loss we suffered,\u201d said Siraha, the organization\u2019s director.",
      "\u201cYou need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,\u201d she said.",
      "Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated.",
      "Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said.",
      "MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,\u201d Chinogwenya said.",
      "However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but \u201cto quiet their guidelines on access to abortion\u201d to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island.",
      "In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO.",
      "\u201cOrganizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,\u201d read part of the 2019 assessment report. \u201cUltimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.\u201d",
      "The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe\u2019s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities.",
      "Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women\u2019s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years.",
      "Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we want is the freedom to space our births.\u201d"

      "Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",
      "The sudden rise in cases of polio, which is an infection caused by a virus that mostly affects children under 5, has hampered the country's yearslong efforts to make it a polio-free state.",
      "The latest case was detected in Tank, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where militants often target polio workers and police assigned for anti-polio campaigns, according to a statement by the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication. Pakistan has reported 50 such cases this year, it said.",
      "Most polio cases this year were reported in the restive southwestern Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces bordering Afghanistan, where 23 confirmed cases have surfaced, according to data from the World Health Organization. That\u2019s up from six cases in 2023.",
      "Hamid Jafari, the WHO director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said last week the forced repatriation of Afghans from Pakistan was a major setback to polio eradication and has led to a \u201cmassive and unpredictable movement\u201d of people within the two countries and across borders.",

      "A judge has struck down Wyoming\u2019s overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy in line with voters in yet more states voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state\u2019s first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \u201cwill undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\u201d Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn\u2019t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won\u2019t be necessary with this ruling."

      "In a statement late Tuesday, the U.N. health agency said it had approved the mpox vaccine made by Japanese company KM Biologics for use in children over 1 year of age as a single dose.",
      "Earlier this month, the charity Save the Children said that cases among children younger than 18 had increased by more than 130% in Congo, noting there were now more than 25,000 suspect cases.",
      "The charity said that children were almost four times more likely than adults to die from the newest form of mpox first detected in eastern Congo earlier this year. Mpox, related to smallpox, mostly causes symptoms including fever, rash, lesions and fatigue.",
      "\u201cChildren are especially vulnerable to mpox,\u201d Save The Children's Dr. Katia Vieira de Moraes LaCasse said in a statement. \u201cThey explore by touch and taste, don't always understand health guidance and have weaker immune systems than adults.\u201d",
      "Scientists have previously noted that mpox appears to be disproportionately affecting children in Congo and Burundi, which account for more than 90% of all mpox cases in Africa's current outbreak.",
      "WHO had previously approved the mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic for people 18 and over, but said that the shot could be used in younger populations, if doctors thought the benefits might outweigh potential risks, given the lack of data in children and other groups including pregnant women.",

      "Experts say people shopping for health insurance right now should look beyond price when searching for coverage for next year",
      "Everyone likes a good deal, and health insurance bargains abound this time of year. But buyers should look beyond price when searching for a plan.",
      "Shoppers also should consider doctor networks and coverage limits to avoid getting stuck with big bills after care.",
      "Millions of Americans are looking for 2025 coverage now during annual enrollment windows for Medicare Advantage plans and individual insurance. Plus, many employers are telling their workers about their coverage plans for next year too.",
      "Insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans are dangling coverage with $0 premiums, and individual insurance marketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act offer tax credits to help with the premium or cost of coverage.",
      "Here are other factors to consider beyond price.",
      "This is the annual amount a patient pays for many covered services before the insurer starts paying a portion of the bill. Plans with low premiums can come with deductibles well over $1,000 for individuals and a few thousand dollars for families.",
      "Shoppers should look at the size of the individual deductible and understand where it applies. Regular visits to a specialist can lead to some hefty patient bills.",
      "Deductibles are different from copayments or copays. Those are flat amounts that a patient pays for a covered service or doctor visit. Copays typically do not count toward paying off a deductible.",
      "Insurers form networks of covered doctors and health systems. Some plans may provide no coverage for care sought outside those networks.",
      "The federal government\u2019s website for finding insurance plans makes it easy to filter for covered doctors and hospitals when looking for plans, said Emily Bremer, president of a St. Louis-based independent insurance agency, The Bremer Group.",
      "Bremer says shoppers should think about more than whether their doctors are in the network. They also should also consider which hospital system they would want to visit if a big emergency happens.",
      "Insurance plans come with formularies, or lists of covered drugs, that vary by plan. Those lists often group drugs in tiers with different costs for the patient.",
      "Shoppers should check to see how a plan will cover the regular prescriptions they already take.",
      "Don\u2019t immediately rule out the plan if the bill would be too high. Help may be available. Drugmakers often have coupons or discount programs that can cover patient costs as long as the drug has coverage, Bremer said. Websites like GoodRx also may be an option for getting a price break.",
      "\u201cIf you take a lot of stuff and see a lot of doctors \u2026 it can be really hard to find one perfect plan that\u2019s going to cover everything,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you have to make choices.\u201d",
      "This is the portion of a bill the patient is responsible for after meeting the deductible. It\u2019s a percentage that can vary. Usually plans with lower premiums leave patients with bigger coinsurance.",
      "Coinsurance payments can hurt, so it\u2019s important to know the percentage and the risk you face.",
      "For instance, a childbirth by cesarean section may generate a $25,000 bill. A patient responsible for a $1,000 deductible and then 20% of the remaining bill through coinsurance could pay $5,800 of that total.",
      "\u201cMost people will focus on the deductible and forget about the coinsurance, and they should not,\u201d Bremer said. \u201c(It) can really sneak up on you when you have a large claim.\u201d",
      "People with low incomes may qualify for help with some of these out-of-pocket expenses through cost-sharing reductions found in the ACA marketplaces.",
      "Health insurers will start handling all costs for covered, in-network care once you reach a plan\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum for patient spending. That can vary by plan.",
      "For coverage sold on the ACA marketplace, that annual maximum cannot be more than $9,200 for individuals and $18,400 for families next year.",
      "Those who reach this level of spending may only see temporary relief. Patient spending totals that count toward that out-of-pocket maximum generally reset at the start of every calendar year or if you switch plans during the year.",

      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",
      "KDADS spokesperson Cara Sloan-Ramos said the department and Gov. Laura Kelly are committed to reducing wait times.",
      "Republican state Rep. Stephen Owens, chair of the House committee handling criminal justice issues, was pleased that the state could settle the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been aware of this issue and have been working on solutions,\" Owens said Tuesday."

    "summary": "North Carolina Republicans have advanced legislation that would weaken the powers of the incoming governor, attorney general and schools superintendent",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina Republicans have advanced legislation that would weaken the powers of the incoming governor, attorney general and schools superintendent",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republicans advanced extensive legislation Tuesday that would weaken the powers of the incoming governor, attorney general and schools superintendent \u2014 all Democrats who were elected two weeks ago \u2014 and shift election board appointments to the GOP state auditor.",
      "The final 131-page measure, which also includes setting aside additional funds for Hurricane Helene relief, became public roughly an hour before the GOP-controlled House met to debate it during a lame-duck General Assembly session this week. The House voted largely along party lines Tuesday night for the measure, which the Republican-controlled Senate was expected to take up on Wednesday.",
      "With Republicans likely to lose their veto-proof majority in the next two-year session following electoral losses in the House, this week could be the last best chance for them to enact legislation containing sharp partisan changes. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper leaves office at year's end and will be succeeded by Democrat Josh Stein.",
      "Currently the State Board of Elections' five members are appointed by the governor based on recommendations by the Democratic and Republican parties. The governor's party always holds three of the seats. Republican legislators have tried for years to wrest away those appointment powers but have been thwarted by courts. Judges have blocked for now a 2023 law that would move board appointment authority from the governor to the General Assembly.",
      "Even with litigation pending, Tuesday's measure would move the independent state board to the State Auditor's Office starting next summer. At that time the new auditor \u2014 Republican Dave Boliek, who was elected this month \u2014 would make appointments. These changes likely would mean Republican control of the board.",
      "In a likely response to complaints about slow vote-counting this month, the bill also would require in 2025 that county election boards count all provisional ballots by three days after Election Day.",
      "Some counties did not complete this year's provisional ballot count until days after last Friday's canvassing date. The measure also would move up the deadline by which some people who lack a photo identification card while voting must show they have one for their ballot to count.",
      "GOP Rep. Grey Mills, a House elections committee chairman, said the state auditor is the best place to house the elections board, given that the post is known for conducting investigations and reviews. And the election counting changes will create more efficiency.",
      "\u201cOur voters expect us to be able to provide the election results in a timely fashion,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI truly believe that this language will do this.\u201d",
      "State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said that board staff were not consulted about the legislation and it \u201cmay make it impossible for the county boards of elections to adequately ensure every eligible ballot cast is counted, especially in high turnout elections.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s bill contains additional Helene-related provisions and locates an additional $227 million from the state\u2019s reserves but orders the money to remain unspent for now. It does give $50 million more to help Cooper\u2019s administration address a shortfall to complete housing projects still left over from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.",
      "State lawmakers previously set aside over $900 million toward Helene relief and recovery in two measures approved this fall and signed by Cooper. Cooper has asked for legislators to provide much more, and quickly.",
      "Democrats from western North Carolina said Republicans were more interested in power grabs than helping businesses and residents damaged by Helene. Republicans used a procedure by which Democrats could not offer amendments.",
      "\u201cThis bill makes it pretty clear that the body is prioritizing political priorities over the very real need for rapid assistance in the western part of our state,\u201d Buncombe County Rep. Eric Ager said. Three Republicans from the west ended up voting no on the bill \u2014 a development that could scuttle a potential Cooper override.",
      "Rep. Donny Lambeth, a Forsyth County Republican who only handled the spending provisions, said lawmakers are receiving Helene spending requests daily.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work still that needs to be done ... and still, quite frankly, a lot of money that\u2019s going to have to be spent,\u201d Lambeth said.",
      "The legislation also would immediately weaken the governor's authority to fill vacancies on the state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court by limiting choices to three candidates offered by the political party of the outgoing justice or judge.",
      "Stein, who is currently attorney general, is being succeeded by fellow Democrat Jeff Jackson. The bill would limit the attorney general in part by barring him in litigation that challenges a law's validity from taking legal positions contrary to the General Assembly. Stein has recently declined to defend in court portions of laws that restrict surgical abortions and abortion pills.",
      "\u201cInstead of stepping up, the Republicans in the General Assembly are grabbing power and exacting political retribution,\u201d Stein said Tuesday on the social platform X.",
      "And the bill also will prevent the superintendent of public instruction \u2014 a post that is switching party control in January, to Democrat Mo Green \u2014 would now be barred from appealing decisions by a state board that reviews charter school applications.",
      "The Republican attempt to erode Democrats' powers recalls similar measures passed in late 2016 that were designed to weaken Cooper, who was about to succeed Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. Those bills led to loud demonstrations in the Legislative Building and dozens of arrests.",
      "__",

Another anesthesiologist who had worked there died while treating herself for dehydration using an IV bag from the facility, prosecutors said.",
      "The surgical center staff concluded that these cases suggested a pattern of intentional adulteration of IV bags used at the center.",

Most people infected don\u2019t have symptoms, but in severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that 1 in 200 polio cases results in permanent paralysis, usually of the legs.",

      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:18:20 -0500",
    "summary": "There&rsquo;s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein held what he called \u201cvery constructive talks\u201d with Lebanese officials in Beirut on Tuesday about a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "\"Today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,\u201d Hochstein said, a day after Hezbollah reportedly gave a positive response to a U.S. draft proposal to end the 13-month war, which the Lebanese group launched to support Hamas in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. proposal could see Israeli ground forces leave Lebanon and Hezbollah militants withdraw away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese army troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to a buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday hit a Lebanese army base in the southern town of Sarafand, killing three soldiers, the army said \u2013 the second deadly strike on Lebanese soldiers in as many days. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military.",
      "Israeli strikes and combat in Lebanon have killed more than 3,500 people and wounded 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The war has displaced nearly 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population.",
      "On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign farmworkers, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles.",
      "In Gaza, health authorities say Israel's war against Hamas has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.",

      "Here's the Latest:",
      "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 The U.N. humanitarian office says thousands of Palestinians in areas of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces are struggling to stay alive because there have been virtually no food or humanitarian aid deliveries for more than 40 days.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric delivered the grim report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs known as OCHA on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cOCHA reports that all attempts by the U.N. to support people in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and parts of Jabaliya \u2013 all of which remain under siege \u2013 have been either denied or impeded,\u201d he said.",
      "So far in November, Dujarric said OCHA reports that 27 out of 31 planned humanitarian missions were rejected by Israel and the other four were severely impeded. That means they were prevented from accomplishing all the critical work they set out to do, he said.",
      "\u201cThe result is that bakeries and kitchens in North Gaza governorate have shut down, nutrition support has been suspended, and the refueling of water and sanitation facilities has been completely blocked,\u201d Dujarric said.",
      "An Israeli ground and air offensive in the north has severely restricting access to its three hospitals which are desperately short of medical supplies, blood and fuel, he said.",
      "Israel blocked attempts by U.N. partners to send in an international emergency medical team to help, he said.",
      "On Sunday, Dujarric said, OCHA supported a mission led by the U.N. World Health Organization that was able to deliver 10,000 liters of fuel to Kamal Adwan Hospital and transfer some 17 patients, three unaccompanied children and nearly two dozen caregivers to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.",
      "Food and medical supplies were also supposed to be delivered to Kamal Adwan but Dujarric said, \u201cour partners say the team was forced to offload the food at an Israeli military checkpoint before reaching the hospital, and only some of the medical supplies could be delivered to the facility.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the U.N. believes Israel is trying to force the estimated 75,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south by denying the aid deliveries, Dujarric replied: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intentions of the Israeli government and the Israeli policy. We\u2019re just seeing the result of it and trying to deal with it.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration says the first meeting of a U.S.-Israel panel to look into reports of civilian harm and damage from the war in Gaza will meet in early December, missing by more than a month a U.S. call for the channel to be set up by the end of October.",
      "State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the upcoming meeting had been agreed to after much discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials on specific incidents and reports of civilian casualties involving American-made or -supplied weapons.",
      "Miller told reporters that \u201cthe purpose of this channel is to inform the ongoing work that the State Department has to make assessments about the use of U.S.-provided weapons.\u201d",
      "He said the information gathered through that channel will inform U.S. policy decisions about any response to potential violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict.",
      "In October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to top Israeli officials warning them that the Biden administration might limit the provision of some U.S. weapons systems to Israel, a close ally, if action to improve humanitarian conditions was not taken within 30 days.",

      "Key will be the resolution\u2019s demand for Lebanon\u2019s armed forces to deploy throughout the south, which Hezbollah largely controls, to assert the country\u2019s sovereignty, Lacroix said.",
      "The resolution calls for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to support the implementation of the resolution\u2019s provisions, and Lacroix says he stressed the importance of \u201cgenuine political will\u201d to achieve that.",
      "The undersecretary-general for peace operations said he also stressed the importance of UNIFIL\u2019s freedom of movement, which is sometimes limited, and the need to clarify restrictions on peacekeepers entering private property.",

      "The approval of the document demonstrates Putin\u2019s readiness to tap his nuclear arsenal to force the West to back down as Moscow presses a slow-moving offensive in Ukraine as the war reached its 1,000th day.",

      "He said Beijing firmly opposes what he described as certain Western countries' interference in China's internal affairs and their attempts to smear Hong Kong's rule of law.",
      "The European Union called the sentencing \u201canother unprecedented blow\u201d against the city's fundamental freedoms, democratic participation and pluralism.",
      "The bloc said in a statement that its members are deeply concerned about the politically motivated prosecution of people engaging in peaceful political activity. It said such activities should be legitimate in any political system that respects basic democratic principles.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said the activists' plan was to undermine, destroy or overthrow the city's political system.",
      "The government said the case was handled strictly in accordance with the law.",

      "Taiwan presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo said democracy is not a crime and condemned the Chinese government for using what she called unjust procedures to suppress the political participation and freedom of speech of Hong Kong pro-democracy figures.",
      "The sentencing \"not only breaks the promises of \u201850 years unchanged\u2019 and \u2018high degree of autonomy,\u2019 but further proves that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is unfeasible,\" she said in a statement.",

      "In Washington, D.C., the chairs of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission said the sentences violate international law and called for wide condemnation. Rep.

    "story": [
      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein says an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d after meeting with officials in Lebanon",
      "BEIRUT -- A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday.",
      "However, there was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis.",
      "Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration\u2019s pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah\u2019s allies in the Lebanese government said the militant group had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both its fighters and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon.",
      "The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to conduct military operations against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday hit a Lebanese army base in the southern town of Sarafand, killing three soldiers, the army said \u2013 the second deadly strike on Lebanese soldiers in as many days. The Israeli military did not immediately comment. At least 41 soldiers have been killed by Israeli bombardment the past month, according to the Lebanese army.",
      "Hochstein said he held \u201cvery constructive talks\u201d with Lebanon\u2019s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cSpecifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,\u201d the envoy told reporters after the two-hour meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. ... It is now within our grasp.\u201d",
      "Berri said the \"situation is good in principle,\u201d although some technical details remain unresolved. The Lebanese side was waiting to hear the results of Hochstein's talks with Israeli officials, he told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.",
      "The United Nations humanitarian office says virtually no food or humanitarian aid has been delivered to northernmost Gaza for more than 40 days because of the Israeli military's siege there.",
      "Experts say famine may already have set in in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.",
      "So far in November, OCHA reports that 27 out of 31 planned humanitarian missions to the north were rejected by Israel and the other four were severely impeded, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday. Devastated towns like Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and parts of Jabaliya remain cut off, he said.",
      "Asked whether the U.N. believes Israel is trying to force the estimated 75,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south by denying the aid deliveries, Dujarric replied: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intentions of the Israeli government and the Israeli policy. We\u2019re just seeing the result of it and trying to deal with it.\u201d",
      "Israel says it puts no restrictions on the quantity of aid entering Gaza and that it is working to increase the amount. This month, it opened a new crossing into central Gaza. So far it has reported a few dozen trucks entering through it.",
      "The flow of aid is at nearly the lowest level of the entire 13-month war. So far this month, Israel says it let into Gaza an average of 88 trucks a day \u2013 less than half the highest rate of the war, in April, which aid groups say was still too low.",
      "From the aid that does enter, only about half actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions and fears of theft often prevent the agency from collecting truck cargos at the border, according to UNRWA, the U.N. agency with the biggest role in the humanitarian operation.",
      "The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps.",
      "On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found.",
      "Nora Muhanna, also displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. \u201cFrom the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.N. said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the war began. It did not say who was behind the theft.",
      "Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an \u201calternative, unfamiliar route\u201d after the aid was brought through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were robbed near the crossing itself.",
      "Israel accuses criminal gangs and Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group.",
      "Al-Aqsa TV, operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young Bedouins who operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions.",
      "The Hamas-run government had a police force that maintained public security before the war, but they have vanished in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent looting and price-gouging in markets.",
      "But the biggest problem is not theft \u2013 it\u2019s the low amount of aid Israel allows into Gaza, said Tamara Alrifai, communications director for UNRWA.",
      "\u201cTake aid into a war zone a few trucks at a time, what do we expect a displaced, hungry and traumatized population to do?\u201d she said.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of them believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed almost 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September.",
      "Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded almost 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles, and tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from homes near the border.",

    "story": [
      "Iraq has begun its first nationwide population census in decades in a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions",
      "BAGHDAD -- Iraq began its first nationwide population census in decades Wednesday, a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions.",
      "The act of counting the population is also contentious. The census is expected to have profound implications for Iraq\u2019s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning.",
      "Minority groups fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system.",
      "The count in territories such as Kirkuk, Diyala and Mosul -- where control is disputed between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government in the north -- has drawn intense scrutiny.",
      "Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning, said agreements on how to conduct the count in the disputed areas were reached in meetings involving Iraq\u2019s prime minister, president and senior officials from the Kurdish region.",
      "\u201cResearchers from all major ethnic groups \u2014 Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Christians \u2014 will conduct the census in these areas to ensure fairness,\u201d he said.",
      "The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region.",
      "The new census \u201ccharts a developmental map for the future and sends a message of stability,\u201d Planning Minister Mohammed Tamim said in a televised address.",
      "The census will be the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq\u2019s demographic, social, and economic landscape, offiials say. Some 120,000 census workers will survey households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days.",
      "The Interior Ministry announced a nationwide curfew during the census period, restricting movement of citizens, vehicles and trains between cities, districts and rural areas, with exceptions for humanitarian cases.",
      "Shops were closed in Baghdad on Wednesday and streets were empty except for checkpoints set up to enforce the curfew. In some neighborhoods, people sat in chairs on the sidewalks drinking tea and talking to the census workers.",
      "Among them was Aqeel Al-Rubaie, a father of three who provided his information to the workers.",
      "\u201cThe census is important, but I do not trust politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may exploit the census for political conflict.\u201d",
      "Census worker Ali Amer, wearing a brown jacket with the logo of the Ministry of Planning, said people asked him, \u201cWill the census cause us harm? And what kind of harm?\u201d He said he tried to reassure them.",
      "The count will be carried out using the \u201cde jure\u201d method, in which people are counted in their usual area of residence, Saleh said.",
      "That means that people internally displaced by years of war will be counted in the areas where they have since settled, not in their original communities. The census will not include Iraqis residing abroad or those forcibly displaced to other countries.",
      "Saleh estimated Iraq\u2019s population at 44.5 million and said the Kurdish region\u2019s share of the national budget \u2014 currently 12% \u2014 is based on an estimated population of 6 million. The census will also clarify the number of public employees in the region.",
      "By order of Iraq\u2019s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian.",
      "\u201cThis approach is intended to prevent tensions and ensure the census serves developmental rather than divisive goals,\u201d Saleh said. The census will be monitored by international observers who will travel across Iraq\u2019s provinces to assess the data quality, he said.",
      "Hogr Chato, director of the Irbil-based Public Aid Organization, said the census will reshape the map of political thinking and future decision making.",
      "\u201cEven though some leaders deny it, the data will inevitably have political and economic implications,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also fair to allocate budgets based on population numbers, as areas with larger populations or those impacted by war need more resources.\u201d",
      "Chato said he believes the delays in conducting the census were not only due to security concerns but also political considerations. \u201cThere was data they didn\u2019t want to make public, such as poverty levels in each governorate,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahead of the census, leaders in Iraq\u2019s various communities urged people to be counted.",
      "In Baghdad\u2019s Adhamiyah district, Abdul Wahhab al-Samarrai, preacher at Imam Abu Hanifa Mosque, urged citizens to cooperate with the census.",
      "\u201cThis is a duty for every Muslim to ensure the rights of future generations,\u201d he said in a Friday sermon the week before the count.",

      "A similar opposition action on Tuesday resulted in an hourslong standoff.",
      "The collapse in Novi Sad has triggered a wave of protests against the populist authorities and arrests of several activists who have taken part. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption led to sloppy renovation work at the station and consequently to the roof collapse.",
      "Serbia's Interior Minister Ivica Dacic on Wednesday warned protesters in a statement that police \u201cwon't tolerate disruption of public law and order, threats to the security of the country and state institutions, as well as attacks on police.\u201d",

      "The authorities have promised a thorough investigation and Serbia\u2019s construction minister, Goran Vesic, resigned shortly after the tragedy. Populist President Aleksandar Vucic has said more resignations will follow, and on Wednesday a former construction minister now in charge of trade, Tomislav Momirovic, also said he was stepping down.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies, simplifying the rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes.",
      "The Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on Wednesday published details of the updated liturgical book, which Francis approved April 29 and which replaces the previous edition that was last published in 2000.",
      "Francis turns 88 in December and, despite some health and mobility problems, appears in fine form. On Wednesday, he presided over a spirited general audience that featured children who spontaneously rushed the stage.",
      "While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that will elect their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites became seemingly necessary after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022.",
      "The Vatican had to work out a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years, and a few months later Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Monsignor Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the papal funeral rites to simplify them.",
      "In that 2023 interview with Mexican Televisa broadcaster N+, Francis also revealed that he had decided he would be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, not in the grottoes underneath St. Peter\u2019s Basilica where most popes are buried.",
      "Ravelli said the new reform simplifies the funeral rites, including eliminating the requirement that the pope be placed on an elevated bier in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing. Rather, he will be on view in a simple coffin, and the burial no longer requires the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The simplification, Ravelli was quoted as saying, is meant \u201cto emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.\u201d",
      "Since his 2013 election, Francis has eschewed the pomp often associated with the papacy to emphasize his role as the bishop of Rome and a servant of the \u201cchurch of the poor.\u201d The Argentine Jesuit lives in the Vatican hotel, not the Apostolic Palace, and travels in small Fords or Fiats, not fancy SUVs.",
      "His desire to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "After every trip, Francis goes to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s president said Wednesday that the government is investigating an alleged ransomware hack of her administration\u2019s legal affairs office after what appeared to be samples of personal information from a database of government employees were posted online.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. defense chief says the Biden administration will give Ukraine antipersonnel land mines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it will give Ukraine antipersonnel mines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances, marking the second major shift on U.S. military support for Kyiv in days.",
      "After allowing Ukraine to use longer-range American missiles to launch strikes deeper into Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the shift in Washington\u2019s policy on antipersonnel land mines for Ukraine was needed to counter changing Russian tactics.",
      "The war, which reached its 1,000-day milestone on Tuesday, has largely been going Russia\u2019s way. Moscow's bigger army is slowly pushing Ukraine\u2019s forces backward in the eastern Donetsk region, while Ukrainian civilians are being maimed and killed by Russian drones and missiles often fired from inside Russia.",
      "Individual ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading the Russian battlefield advance, so Ukraine has \u201ca need for things that can help slow down that effort,\u201d Austin said during a trip to Laos.",
      "The announcement comes two months before Donald Trump replaces Joe Biden in the White House. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war and has criticized the amount the U.S. has spent on supporting Ukraine.",
      "Biden administration officials say they are determined to help Ukraine as much as possible before he leaves office, and they announced Wednesday that the U.S. intends to cancel half of the debt \u2014 some $4.6 billion \u2014 Ukraine owes to the country. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said U.S. lawmakers were informed of the move this week, and that he doesn't expect them to pass a resolution of disapproval to try to stop the loan forgiveness because of the bipartisan support for Ukraine in the current Congress.",
      "The steps taken to help Ukraine \u2014 along with unconfirmed reports Wednesday of Ukraine firing a certain British cruise missile at Russia for the first time \u2014 were likely to vex Moscow.",
      "The U.S. and some other Western embassies in Kyiv closed for the day Wednesday in response to the threat of a potentially major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital.",
      "Humanitarian groups have long criticized the use of antipersonnel mines because they present a lingering threat to civilians. Amnesty International called the U.S. decision \u201creckless\u201d and a \u201cdeeply disappointing setback.\" And Norway\u2019s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, called it \u201cvery problematic\u201d because Ukraine is a signatory to an international convention opposing the use of land mines.",
      "Austin pointed out that Ukraine already makes its own antipersonnel mines, and that the U.S. has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines. He also tried to allay concerns about the new mines the U.S. is giving Kyiv, saying they are not persistent, meaning troops can control when they would self-detonate.",
      "\u201cThat makes it far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own,\u201d Austin said.",
      "The mines are are electrically fused and powered by batteries so that when the battery runs out, they won\u2019t detonate. They can become inert in anywhere from four hours to two weeks.",
      "Russia already uses land mines in Ukraine, but those don\u2019t become inert over time.",
      "The United States also sought commitments from the Ukrainians on the use of the mines to limit harm to innocent civilians, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine would use the mines in its own country and would not put them in civilian populated areas.",
      "The mines are contained in a $275 million package of new military assistance from the Biden administration, according to a different U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid package hasn't been formerly announced. Also included in the package are High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, as well as 155 mm and 105 mm artillery rounds, Javelin anti-armor munitions, and other equipment and spare parts.",
      "The war has taken on a growing international dimension with the arrival of North Korean troops to help Russia on the battlefield \u2014 a development that U.S. officials said prompted Biden\u2019s policy shift on allowing Ukraine to fire longer-range U.S. missiles into Russia and that angered the Kremlin.",
      "Britain had been quietly pressing the U.S. to ease restrictions on how Western-supplied missiles are used, and unconfirmed news reports Wednesday said Ukraine had fired British-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles at Russia for the first time. British and Ukrainian officials didn't confirm the reports.",
      "Officials with France's military and president\u2019s office, meanwhile, declined to say whether Ukraine is using French long-range SCALP missiles to strike targets in Russia, citing France's military secrecy policy. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for such a step for months.",
      "After the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to attack Russia with longer-range American-made ATACMS missiles, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal, with the new doctrine announced Tuesday permitting a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.",
      "That could potentially include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S.",
      "The American diplomatic mission in Kyiv said Wednesday that it had received a warning about a potentially significant Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital and was staying closed for the day. It anticipated a quick return to regular operations. The Spanish, Italian and Greek embassies also closed for the day, but the U.K. government and France said that their embassies remained open.",
      "Western leaders dismissed the Russian reaction to the U.S. missile decision as an attempt to deter Ukraine\u2019s allies from providing further support to Kyiv, but the escalating tension weighed on stock markets after Ukraine fired ATACMS missiles for the first time at a target inside Russia.",
      "Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia been stockpiling powerful long-range missiles, possibly in an upcoming effort to crush the Ukrainian power grid as winter approaches.",
      "Military analysts say the U.S. decision on the range over which American-made missiles can be used isn't expected to be a game-changer, but it could help weaken the Russian war effort, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.",
      "\u201cUkrainian long-range strikes against military objects within Russia\u2019s rear are crucial for degrading Russian military capabilities throughout the theater,\" it said.",
      "Meanwhile, North Korea recently supplied additional artillery systems to Russia, according to South Korea. It said that North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the front lines.",
      "Ukraine struck a factory in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region that makes cargo drones for the armed forces in an overnight attack, according to Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation branch of Ukraine\u2019s Security Council.",
      "He also claimed Ukraine hit an arsenal in Russia\u2019s Novgorod region, near the town of Kotovo, located about 680 kilometers (420 miles) behind the Ukrainian border. The arsenal stored artillery ammunition and various types of missiles, he said.",
      "It wasn't possible to independently verify the claims.",

      "Spain will grant residency and work permits to about 300,000 migrants in the country illegally each year for the next three years",
      "MADRID -- Spain will grant residency and work permits to about 300,000 migrants living in the country illegally each year for the next three years, the country's migration minister said Wednesday.",
      "The policy will take effect next May and aims to expand the country's aging workforce. Spain has remained largely open to receiving migrants even as other European nations seek to tighten their borders to illegal crossings and asylum seekers.",
      "Spain needs around 250,000 registered foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, Migration Minister Elma Saiz said in an interview on Wednesday. She contended that the legalization policy is not aimed solely at \u201ccultural wealth and respect for human rights, it\u2019s also prosperity.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we can say Spain is a better country,\u201d Saiz told national broadcaster Radio Nacional de Espa\u00f1a.",
      "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has often described his government's migration policies as a means to combat the country's low birthrate.",
      "The new policy, approved Tuesday by S\u00e1nchez's leftist minority coalition government, simplifies administrative procedures for short and long-term visas and provides migrants with additional labor protections. It extends a visa previously offered to job-seekers for three months to one year.",
      "In August, S\u00e1nchez visited three West African nations in an effort to address irregular migration to Spain\u2019s Canary Islands.",
      "The archipelago off the coast of Africa is seen by many as a step toward continental Europe with young men from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and elsewhere embarking on dangerous sea voyages there seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability at home.",
      "By mid-November, some 54,000 migrants had reached Spain this year by sea or land, according to the country's Interior Ministry. The exact number of foreigners living in Spain illegally is not clear.",
      "Many such migrants make a living in Spain's underground economy as fruit pickers, caretakers, delivery drivers, or other low-paid but essential jobs often passed over by Spaniards.",
      "Without legal protections, they can be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Saiz said the new policy would help prevent such abuse and \"serve to combat mafias, fraud and the violation of rights.\"",
      "Spain's economy is among the fastest-growing in the European Union this year, boosted in part by a strong rebound in tourism after the pandemic.",
      "In 2023, Spain issued 1.3 million visas to foreigners, according to the government.",

    "story": [
      "Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister has approved an anticipated comprehensive military operation against separatist groups in the country's restive southwest",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's Prime Minister on Tuesday approved a long-awaited \u201ccomprehensive military operation\u201d against separatist groups in the restive southwest, more than a week after an outlawed group killed 26 people in a suicide bombing at a train station, officials said.",
      "The announcement by Shehbaz Sharif to launch the operation \"against terrorist organizations\" operating in Balochistan came after a meeting of the government's security committee in Islamabad, the capital. On Nov. 9, a suicide bomber with the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army group blew himself up at a train station in Quetta, killing 26 people, most of them soldiers.",
      "In a statement, Sharif's office said the BLA and other groups will be targeted buit didn't say when the operation would begin. The office blamed the groups for \u201ctargeting innocent civilians and foreign nationals to scuttle Pakistan\u2019s economic progress by creating insecurity at the behest of hostile external powers.\"",
      "In recent months, Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have witnessed a surge in militant violence, most blamed on the outlawed BLA and TTP groups. The train station attack in Quetta was the deadliest since August, when separatists killed more than 50 people in multiple coordinated attacks on passengers buses, police and security forces across Balochistan.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country\u2019s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.",
      "The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The BLA wants a halt to all Chinese-funded projects and for Chinese workers to leave Pakistan to avoid further attacks.",
      "Also Tuesday, a suicide car bomber targeted a security post in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to Irfan Kahn, a local police official. Kahn said gunshots were heard and and ambulances had arrived at the scene of the attack. He provided no further details, and it was not immediately clear how many people were killed or wounded in the attack.",
      "The attack came a day after Pakistani security forces raided a militant hideout in the northwestern district of Tirah, sparking a shootout in which at least 10 insurgents were killed and several others were wounded.",

      "As tens of thousands of marchers thronged the streets in New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington, the column of people, flags aloft, had the air of a festival or a parade rather than a protest",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- As tens of thousands crowded the streets in New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington, on Tuesday, the throng of people, flags aloft, had the air of a festival or a parade rather than a protest.",
      "They were marching to oppose a law that would reshape the county\u2019s founding treaty between Indigenous M\u0101ori and the British Crown. But for many, it was also a celebration of a resurging Indigenous language and identity that colonization had once almost destroyed.",
      "\u201cJust fighting for the rights that our t\u016bpuna, our ancestors, fought for,\u201d Shanell Bob said as she waited for the march to begin. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our tamariki, for our mokopuna, so they can have what we haven\u2019t been able to have,\u201d she added, using the M\u0101ori words for children and grandchildren.",
      "What was likely the country\u2019s largest-ever protest in support of M\u0101ori rights \u2014 a subject that has preoccupied modern New Zealand for much of its young history \u2014 followed a long tradition of peaceful cross-country marches that have marked turning points in the nation's story.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going for a walk!\u201d one organizer proclaimed from the stage as crowds gathered at the opposite end of the city from the nation\u2019s Parliament. People had traveled from across the nation over the past nine days.",
      "For many, the turnout reflected growing solidarity on Indigenous rights from non-M\u0101ori. At bus stops during the usual morning commute, people of all ages and races waited with M\u0101ori sovereignty flags. Some local schools said they would not register students as absent. The city\u2019s mayor joined the protest.",
      "The bill that marchers are opposing is unpopular and unlikely to become law. But opposition to it has been widespread, which marchers said indicated rising knowledge of the Treaty of Waitangi\u2019s promises to M\u0101ori among New Zealanders \u2014 and a small but vocal backlash from those who are angered by the attempts of courts and lawmakers to keep them.",
      "M\u0101ori marching for their rights is not new. But the crowds were larger than at treaty marches before and the mood was changed, Indigenous people said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s different to when I was a child,\u201d Bob said. \u201cWe\u2019re stronger now, our tamariki are stronger now, they know who they are, they\u2019re proud of who they are.\u201d",
      "As the marchers moved through the streets of Wellington with ringing M\u0101ori haka \u2014 rhythmic chants \u2014 and waiata, or songs, thousands more holding signs lined the pavement in support.",
      "Some placards bore jokes or insults about the lawmakers responsible for the bill, which would change the meaning of the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi and prevent them from applying only to M\u0101ori \u2014 whose chiefs signed the document when New Zealand was colonized.",
      "But others read \u201cproud to be M\u0101ori\u201d or acknowledged the bearer\u2019s heritage as a non-M\u0101ori person endorsing the protest. Some denounced the widespread expropriation of M\u0101ori land during colonization, one of the main grievances arising from the treaty.",
      "\u201cThe treaty is a document that lets us be here in Aotearoa so holding it up and respecting it is really important,\u201d said Ben Ogilvie, who is of P\u0101keh\u0101 or New Zealand European descent, using the M\u0101ori name for the country. \u201cI hate what this government is doing to tear it down.\u201d",
      "Police estimated that 42,000 people tried to crowd into Parliament\u2019s grounds, with some spilling into the surrounding streets. People crammed themselves onto the children's slide on the lawn for a vantage point; others perched in trees. The tone was almost joyful; as people waited to leave the cramped area, some struck up M\u0101ori songs that most New Zealanders learn at school.",
      "A sea of M\u0101ori sovereignty flags in red, black and white stretched down the lawn and into the streets. But marchers bore Samoan, Tongan, Indigenous Australian, U.S., Palestinian and Israeli flags, too. At Parliament, speeches from political leaders drew attention to the reason for the protest \u2014 a proposed law that would change the meaning of words in the country\u2019s founding treaty, cement them in law and extend them to everyone.",
      "Its author, libertarian lawmaker David Seymour \u2014 who is M\u0101ori \u2014 says the process of redress for decades of Crown breaches of its treaty with M\u0101ori has created special treatment for Indigenous people, which he opposes.",
      "The bill\u2019s detractors say it would spell constitutional upheaval, dilute Indigenous rights, and that it has provoked divisive rhetoric about M\u0101ori \u2014 who are still disadvantaged on almost every social and economic metric, despite attempts by the courts and lawmakers in recent decades to rectify inequities caused in large part by breaches of the treaty.",
      "It is not expected to ever become law, but Seymour made a political deal that saw it shepherded through a first vote last Thursday. In a statement Tuesday, he said the public could now make submissions on the bill, which he hopes will experience a swell of support.",
      "Seymour briefly walked out onto Parliament\u2019s forecourt to observe the protest, although he was not among the lawmakers invited to speak. Some in the crowd booed him.",
      "The protest was \u201ca long time coming,\u201d said Papa Heta, one of the marchers, who said M\u0101ori sought acknowledgement and respect.",
      "\u201cWe hope that we can unite with our P\u0101keh\u0101 friends, Europeans,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, there are those that make decisions that put us in a difficult place.\u201d"

      "Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. He said his father died at a Tokyo hospital due to old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a bestseller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad,\" a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children, and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "In his prose poem with that title, in which a boy is opening a Coke can, he wrote: \u201cIf, for instance, he saw the infinite universe that started or ended at the tip of his can, he was totally unaware of it. One might be able to opine that he named every bit of the unknown about to swallow him with all the vocabulary he could muster, which included his future vocabulary that was yet dormant in his subconscious.\u201d",
      "In his debut poem that catapulted him to stardom, he is more sparse:",
      "\u201cBecause the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,\u201d is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.",
      "When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

      "Germany\u2019s foreign minister has vowed that her country will not be intimidated by Russia\u2019s new nuclear deterrent policy as it had in the past",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Germany\u2019s foreign minister vowed on Tuesday that her country would not be intimidated by Russia\u2019s new nuclear deterrent policy, saying the mistakes of the past would not be repeated.",
      "Annalena Baerbock told a news conference in Poland that Berlin will now heed the warnings of partners that border Ukraine. She was attending a meeting of foreign ministers of Poland, Germany, France and Italy on the 1,000th day since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Baerbock said Germany and its partners \u201cwill not be intimidated\u201d while \u201cPutin is playing with our fear.\"",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t just start doing this 1,000 days ago. He started back in 2014,\" Baerbock said.",
      "\"And Germany in particular made the mistake back then, especially politically, of allowing itself to be intimidated by this fear and, above all, not listening to its partners, especially our Eastern European partners, who made it clear at the time: We must not rely on promises from the Kremlin. We must invest in our own security and protection.\u201d",
      "President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed a revised nuclear doctrine declaring that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country.",
      "It follows U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles.",
      "Baerbock said Putin is seeking to divide Europe, but was \"bitterly mistaken.\u201d",
      "The foreign ministers held talks about stepping up Europe\u2019s military support for Ukraine as well as ties with the United States under Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump says he expects Europe to make a greater effort for its own defense in the face of Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said the meeting \u201cagreed that Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security, and that includes a more balanced sharing of the burdens among NATO members.\"",
      "The ministers said their meeting was an expression of unity and solidarity with Ukraine. They observed a minute of silence in memory of the Ukrainian victims.",
      "Also attending the meeting was the European Union\u2019s upcoming chief of diplomacy, Kaja Kallas. For \u201clogistical reasons,\u201d Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha could not attend in person, Sikorski said.",
      "The meeting was prompted by Russia\u2019s intensified missile strikes on Ukraine and by Trump\u2019s presidential election win and the changes in trans-Atlantic relations it may bring, Sikorski added."

      "Germany\u2019s defense minister says officials have to assume that damage to two data cables under the Baltic Sea was caused by sabotage",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's defense minister said Tuesday officials have to assume damage to two data cables under the Baltic Sea, one of which ends in Germany, was caused by sabotage \u2014 though he said they have no proof at present.",
      "Damage was detected Monday to the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) from Finland's capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Another cable between Lithuania and Sweden was also damaged.",
      "Speaking in Brussels, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat, and that Europe needs to take a broad approach to defense. He said the damage to the two cables was \u201ca very clear sign that something is afoot.\"",
      "\u201cNo one believes these cables were severed by mistake, and I also don't want to believe versions that it was anchors that by chance caused damage to these cables,\u201d he said at a regular meeting of European Union defense ministers.",
      "\u201cSo we have to state \u2014 without knowing in concrete terms who it came from \u2014 that this is a hybrid action. And we also have to assume \u2014 without already knowing it, obviously \u2014 that this is sabotage.\u201d",
      "The foreign ministries of Finland and Germany had already said Monday evening that the damage raised suspicion of sabotage.",
      "They said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that \u201cour European security is not only under threat from Russia\u2018s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.\u201d",
      "The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d be safeguarded.",
      "On Tuesday, Swedish police said they had launched a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage regarding the two cable breaches, though they said the classification of the suspected offense \u201cmay change.\u201d"

      "Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai is testifying in his defense at his landmark national security trial",
      "HONG KONG -- Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai denied in his landmark national security trial on Wednesday he had asked then U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against the city and China during the territory's anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "He testified about his meetings with former U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including Taiwan ex-President Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong\u2019s last British governor, Chris Patten.",
      "The media tycoon, who also describes himself as a businessman and social activist, said he never tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong or China through the people he met overseas or ask them to take action against them.",
      "Lai\u2019s case is widely seen as a measure of media freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "Lai testified in English that he asked Pence to voice his support for Hong Kong during a 2019 visit to the U.S. But he said he did not ask the U.S. government to take any action, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me.\u201d",
      "During the same trip Lai also met with Pompeo and had a similar discussion about the situation in Hong Kong, he said.",
      "When Lai\u2019s lawyer, Steven Kwan, asked him whether he had requested the U.S. to do something at that meeting, Lai said \u201cnot to do something but to say something. To voice out its support for Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "Beijing promised to retain the former British colony\u2019s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. But critics say that promise has become threadbare under the rubric of maintaining national security.",
      "Authorities have used a Beijing-imposed national security law to prosecute many of Hong Kong\u2019s leading activists, including Lai and 45 democracy advocates who were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law.",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \u201cunder the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\u201d",
      "They pointed to Lai\u2019s meetings with Pence, Pompeo and U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement.",
      "Dozens of people stood in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong, who said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,\u201d said Wong, 64.",
      "Upon entering the court, Lai waved and smiled at his family members, who sat next to the city\u2019s Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen.",
      "During the hearing, Lai said that he had introduced former U.S. officials Paul Wolfowitz and Jack Keane to Tsai, whom he called a friend.",
      "Lai said Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then President Donald Trump's administration, and knew he was \u201csupportive of Trump.\" She thought he was familiar with the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said.",
      "He said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S., because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people.",
      "But Lai rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence, saying it was a \u201ccrazy\u201d idea and he never allowed his staff or the newspaper to mention it.",
      "He said he broke into the media world \u201cto participate in delivering freedom.\"",
      "\u201cThe more you know, the more you are free,\u201d he said, adding that the core values of Apple Daily were the core values of the people of Hong Kong, including the rule of law, freedom and the pursuit of democracy",
      "In May 2020, a month before the security law took effect, Lai took up the role of executive chairman of Next Digital, the parent company of Apple Daily.",
      "The trial will continue on Thursday.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. governments and independent U.N. human rights experts have called for Lai\u2019s release.",
      "Asked before his reelection this month whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai\u2019s release, Trump said: \u201c100%, I will get him out.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said that mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai\u2019s detention to Xi in a meeting during the Group of 20 summit in Brazil.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s security minister Chris Tang maintained the prosecution was based on facts.",
      "Lai\u2019s son, Sebastien Lai, said on Friday that his father\u2019s treatment in prison is \u201cinhumane.\u201d \u201cMy father is now 77 and has spent nearly four years in a maximum-security prison in solitary confinement,\u201d he said in the statement released by Britain-based law firm Doughty Street Chambers.",
      "On Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned some members of the law firm for what it called spreading misinformation. It said the separation of Lai from other inmates \u201chas been made at his own request\u201d and was approved by prison authorities. It added judges remain independent and partial when handling national security cases.",
      "Chinese foreign ministry's spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Wednesday that Lai is a major mastermind in the rise of anti-China sentiments in Hong Kong and a \u201cpawn of anti-China forces.\u201d He said China firmly opposes the interference of certain countries in its internal affairs.",
      "On the eve of the court hearing, some U.S. lawmakers gathered with the younger Lai in a restaurant near the U.S. Capitol in Washington in a show of support for the publisher.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in the U.K. has risen sharply to a six-month high in October, cementing market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing rates this year",
      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. rose sharply to a six-month high in October and back above the rate targeted by rate-setters at the Bank of England, official figures showed Wednesday, cementing market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing costs this year.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said higher domestic energy bills pushed up consumer price inflation up to 2.3% in the year to October from the three-year low of 1.7% recorded the previous month. Stubbornly high inflation in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy, didn't help either.",
      "The increase, which was above forecasts for a more modest increase, took inflation above the bank's target rate of 2%.",
      "Earlier this month, the bank decreased its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 after inflation fell to its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "However, Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey cautioned that rates wouldn't be falling too fast over the coming months, partly because last month's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done. Rate-setters will meet once more this year, on Dec. 19, by which time they will be armed with more monthly inflation readings.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-9.",
      "Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England.",
      "In her budget, British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could push inflation higher than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The global inflation outlook has also become more uncertain since Donald Trump was reelected U.S. president. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, and thereby keeping interest rates higher than they otherwise would have been.",
      "\u201cWhile we think the Bank of England will continue to cut rates in 2025, the pace of rate cuts is expected to be slower than previously anticipated, and rates may stay elevated for longer,\u201d said Monica George Michail, an economist at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a think tank that now reckons inflation will push above 3% in early 2025.",
      "\u201cThis outlook reflects forecasted inflationary pressures stemming from the recently announced budget, in addition to heightened global uncertainty, particularly surrounding the Trump presidency,\u201d she added."

      "Residents of the Hawaii town devastated by last year's wildfire are awaiting the return of one of the nation's most prestigious basketball tournaments with mixed feelings",
      "HONOLULU -- Three generations of TJ Rickard\u2019s family lost their homes in the deadly Maui wildfire more than a year ago, and he and his extended family still have not rebuilt. That leaves Rickard, a high school basketball coach, conflicted about next week's return of the storied Maui Invitational college tournament.",
      "Like many, Rickard is excited to have top-drawer basketball played in Lahaina\u2019s humble arena, but he worries people will think it's business as usual in his hometown. In truth, he says, Lahaina is still struggling after the fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes.",
      "\u201cNot even a minute drive away from where they play, there\u2019s houses that are burned down that are still waiting to be rebuilt,\u201d said Rickard, the boys head coach at Lahainaluna High School.",
      "Many residents are excited about the local exposure to high-caliber competition and the economic boost the Maui Invitational will bring. But there\u2019s also a fear that travelers might show disrespect by wandering into the Lahaina burn zone and taking photos of the devastation, or trigger unpleasant memories with questions about that catastrophic day.",
      "\u201cPeople are in a weird state right now over here because there\u2019s so much displacement and loss of community,\u201d said Jon Conrad, Lahainaluna's athletic director. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly sensitive and slightly charged environment.\u201d",
      "Boosters coming to Lahaina should know \u201cit\u2019s been a year and more, but things are still a little raw,\" Conrad said.",
      "The Maui Invitational will bring eight of the NCAA\u2019s best men\u2019s teams \u2014 including two-time defending champion UConn \u2014 to Lahaina\u2019s 2,400-seat gymnasium for three days.",
      "Last year, organizers moved the tournament to Honolulu instead of intruding on Lahaina when many survivors were still living in hotels and charred rubble littered properties. This year, they decided to bring the 40-year-old event back after meeting with the governor's office, the Hawaii Tourism Authority and Maui's mayor, said Tom Valdiserri, executive vice president of KemperSports LIVE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our home and we want to be there. And Maui is our ohana, frankly,\u201d Valdiserri said, using the Hawaiian word for family.",
      "Reconstruction is progressing slowly. The Army Corps of Engineers has fully cleared all residential lots and 91% of commercial lots of fire debris. Maui County has issued 133 building permits after receiving 291 applications. One property has been finished.",
      "Rickard\u2019s experience shows how challenging housing is even 15 months after the fire. The blaze burned down his grandparents' house and the in-law unit on their property where Rickard lived with his wife and dog. His parents\u2019 house a few lots away got torched. The blaze claimed a cousin's house across the street and another cousin's place the next street over. A great-aunt who lived down the road lost her house, too.",
      "Rickard now lives in an apartment a 45-minute drive away that's paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His relatives are living with friends or other family.",
      "Maui officials hope the tournament will help rebuild the tourism industry, which took a massive hit. In 2022, the last year the Maui Invitational was held in Lahaina, the competition brought 6,500 visitors and $24 million in spending to Maui, KemperSports LIVE said.",
      "University of Hawaii researchers said last month that fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in Lahaina's tourism industry still do. Those with jobs are working fewer hours, their report said.",
      "Rebuilding helps Javier Barberi cope with the disaster. His company, Hana Hou Hospitality, reopened a popular beachfront restaurant that was spared by the flames \u2014 Mala Ocean Tavern \u2014 eight months after the fire. He and his partners overhauled another restaurant and launched it as a new establishment called Coco Deck. To him, the tournament's return is a sign of hope.",
      "\u201cLike, hey, we used to have this. It was gone. Now it\u2019s back,\" Barberi said. \"That restaurant was gone. Now it\u2019s back. That house was gone, now it\u2019s being rebuilt. To see these things happen, it starts to bring things back to normal and bring Maui back.\u201d",
      "Jason Donez, general manager of Leilani's restaurant, remembers his daughter Lola meeting Mike Krzyzewski, Duke's head coach at the time, at a free-throw contest in 2018. The Hall of Fame coach told the 12-year-old she had a nice shot, she should stick with it and he would see her in college one day, Donez said.",
      "Today, Lola Donez is a freshman guard at Cal.",
      "Being around the teams helped her \u201cdream big,\u201d her father said.",

      "Many of these affordable luxuries can be tucked into a stocking, but they also make great presents for a co-worker, mail carrier, nephew or teacher. As a slightly compulsive and obsessive gift giver, matching the right edible treat to the recipient is my jam (another great gifting option!).",
      "All of these items cost under $50, but make a big splash.",
      "Let\u2019s go!",
      "Two Chinese American friends took the flavors of their favorite childhood treats and transformed them into sweet spreads, ready to be slathered on toast, apples or just eaten with a spoon. Rooted Fare sells spreads like Crunchy Black Sesame Butter (inspired by tang yuan, a Lunar New Year dessert ), Pineapple Cake Cashew Butter, and Chinese Almond Cookie Butter. $15 per jar.",

      "Chef Patricia Quintana has created a line of salsas, sauces, dressings and condiments that preserves the heritage of traditional Mexican cooking. Treat someone to a jar of Achiote sauce or Pineapple Habanero Salsa (and hope you get invited over for the ensuing meal). $15 to $20 per jar.",
      "Ever heard of Secret Aardvark sauces? You might be tempted to spread the word. This Caribbean/Tex-Mex line of condiments has a big following for what they call their \u201cflavor that kicks you in the mouth.\u201d There are many choices, including Drunken Jerk Jamaican Marinade, and Aardvark Habanero Hot Sauce. $10 each, with combo packs starting at $20.",

      "I can\u2019t think of a food gift I\u2019m happier to see than a high-quality bottle of oil or vinegar, two of the most-used ingredients in my kitchen. Bona Fortuna's selection of Sicilian olive oils is fresh and fragrant, and their aged balsamic vinegars are thick, sweet and rich. The Invecchiato 7-Year Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, for instance, sells for $44.95; Forte Extra Virgin Olive Oil from $10.95 to $39.95.",
      "Metafora olive oil comes in a beautiful bottle and is a nice introduction to Portuguese olive oil. $40.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:50:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Target has reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items",
    "story": [
      "Target has reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items",
      "NEW YORK -- Target on Wednesday reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
      "The Minneapolis retailer fell short of Wall Street expectations for the quarter, and its profit and sales outlook for the final three months of the year also disappointed industry analysts. Costs related to a U.S. dockworkers\u2019 strike in October also dragged on Target's results at a time when Americans are spending more selectively, the company said.",
      "\u201cWe encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures that impacted our bottom-line performance,\u201d Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said.",
      "The weak August through October period at Target stood in stark contrast to the third quarter of low-price rival Walmart, which reported another quarter of stellar sales Tuesday and released optimistic projections for the holiday season.",
      "Target's outlook was particularly concerning because the discount merchandiser reduced prices on more than 2,000 products for the holidays and rolled out a Thanksgiving dinner deal that put the cost of the holiday meal below last year's total.",
      "Target\u2019s shares plummeted more than 21% in afternoon trading Wednesday, while Walmart's share rose nearly 3%, closing at $86.60 on Tuesday.",
      "The disappointing quarter at Target may have reflected the financial circumstances and mood of U.S. consumers in the months before Election Day. Even as the overall inflation rate came down, voters told pollsters they were unhappy with the state of the economy when the costs of housing, food and other essentials remained so high compared to before the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Customers are \u201cbeing very patient, shopping for promos, looking for great value on those essential items that they need for their pantry,\u201d Cornell told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cAnd they\u2019re shopping very conservatively and have been in discretionary categories throughout the year.\u201d",
      "That consumer sentiment wasn't aligned in Target\u2019s favor. Groceries account for about 60% of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business, according to the Arkansas-based company\u2019s most recent annual report. Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing and accessories because less than a quarter of its sales come from food and beverages.",
      "\u201cAll these things undermine the Target model, which partly relies on a robust consumer who is comfortable loading their cart with things that they want but do not absolutely need,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData, said.",
      "Walmart\u2019s size also makes it difficult for its competitor to prevail on price. Walmart operates nearly 5,000 stores in the U.S. and generated annual sales of $611.3 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2024. In contrast, Target operates 1,900 stores and generated sales of $107.4 billion in the latest fiscal year.",
      "And even if Target has prices that are lower than or equal to Walmart's on some items, it has always battled a perception of being more expensive, Saunders said.",
      "Their marketing slogans reinforce that perception: Target's is \u201cExpect More. Pay Less.\u201d Walmart's is \u201cEvery Day Low Prices.\u201d",
      "Target recorded its lackluster quarterly sales even as it has moved aggressively to cut prices. For the summer, it lowered prices on thousands of necessities ranging from diapers to milk. By the end of December, the company said it will have reduced the prices of over 10,000 items during the year.",
      "Analysts also say that Target has faced stiffer competition from Walmart when it comes to discretionary items like home goods and apparel. Over the past few years, Walmart has added mannequins in its fashion departments and spruced up its fashion selection with more stylish items.",
      "While Target has refreshed its food offerings, Walmart recently launched Bettergoods, its biggest store-label food brand in 20 years in terms of the breadth of items, seeking to appeal to younger customers who are not loyal to grocery brands and want chef-inspired foods that are more affordably priced. The colorfully packaged products include pistachio nut butter and smokey vanilla ground coffee.",
      "Walmart said it's been gaining market share, especially among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online shopping services, which included curbside order pickups, and its paid membership shipping program, Walmart +, also have helped attract wealthier customers.",
      "In response, Target has tried to step up its game. In April, it unveiled a paid membership program called Target Circle 360, which comes with unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 and free two-day shipping for all orders.",
      "Saunders noted that Target has also struggled with operational issues.",
      "Target, like other retailers, had to reroute some merchandise when 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for the first time since 1977. For Walmart, the walkout seemed to cause a hiccup. But the strike took a toll on Target's profits as it struggled with inventory buildup in its warehouses.",
      "Target posted net income of $854 million, or $1.85 per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 2, far short of the $2.30 analysts were looking for, according to FactSet, and down from $971 million, or $2.10 per share, in the year-ago period.",
      "Sales rose to $25.67 billion, up from $25.4 billion last year, but fell shy of Wall Street expectations.",
      "Target said that it now expects its earnings per share to be in the range of $1.85 to $2.45 for its fiscal fourth quarter. That\u2019s below the $2.65 per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "The retailer reported that its comparable sales \u2014 those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months \u2014 rose 0.3% during the third quarter. That\u2019s below the 2% gain posted in the second quarter. The increase in the April-June period reversed months of declines, including a 3.7% drop in the first quarter and a 4.4% decline during the company\u2019s final quarter of 2023.",
      "There were some bright spots. Target said quarterly customer traffic increased 2.4%. Target executives said that translates to 10 million more sales transactions from a year ago. Digital comparable sales also increased 10.8%, reflecting a 20% increase in same-day delivery.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from other countries will create challenges for Target and other retailers. Retailers have warned they would be forced to pass the costs of higher tariffs on to shoppers.",
      "\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to what will happen, and we\u2019ll use our agility to adjust accordingly, \u201d Cornell told reporters Tuesday."

      "The treasury role has been at the center of an unusual high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely. Trump has yet to decide on one of the top remaining vacancies in his proposed cabinet.",
      "The major remaining nominees for the role are Bessent, former Federal Reserve board governor Kevin Warsh, Apollo Global Management Chief Executive Marc Rowan, and Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, Trump's former Japan ambassador.",
      "Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. On the campaign trail, Trump portrayed the taxes on imports as both a negotiating tool to hammer out better trade terms and as a way to generate revenue to fund tax cuts elsewhere.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick gave full-throated support for Trump's tariffs plan in a CNBC interview in September. \u201cTariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker,\" he said.",

He also selected Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former television talk show host and heart surgeon, to head the agency that oversees health insurance programs for millions of older, poor and disabled Americans, and named Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department.",
      "McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s initial term from 2017 to 2019 and twice ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut.",
      "McMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009 and has spent years on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. She\u2019s seen as a relative unknown in education circles, though she has expressed support for charter schools and school choice.",
      "\u201cLinda will use her decades of Leadership experience, and deep understanding of both Education and Business, to empower the next Generation of American Students and Workers, and make America Number One in Education in the World,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",

      "After her time in the Trump administration, McMahon became the chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank created by Trump supporters and former officials who have been preparing for his return to government. McMahon has also been chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC.",

      "\u201cDr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention, so we get the best results in the World for every dollar we spend on Healthcare in our Great Country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe will also cut waste and fraud within our Country\u2019s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation\u2019s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.\u201d",

      "If confirmed by the Senate, Oz would be responsible for the programs \u2014 Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that more than half the country relies on for health insurance.",
      "Medicaid provides nearly-free health care coverage to millions of the poorest children and adults in the U.S., while Medicare gives older Americans and the disabled access to health insurance. The Affordable Care Act is the Obama-era program that offers health insurance plans to millions of Americans who do not qualify for government-assisted health insurance, but do not get insurance through their employer.",
      "Trump has said he wants to overhaul the Affordable Care Act but has said he only has \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d for how that redesign would operate. During his first term in office, he tried unsuccessfully to scrap the program altogether. Last month, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson promised that health care reform would be a big part of Trump's second term agenda.",
      "During his campaign for senate, Oz promised to expand Medicare Advantage, the privately run version of Medicare that has become increasingly popular but also a source of widespread fraud.",

Oz has been accused of hawking dubious medical treatments and products on his defunct TV show. And during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, he pressured government officials to make hydroxychloroquine widely available, despite unresolved questions about its safety and effectiveness.",

      "VANG VIENG, Laos -- Two Australian tourists are being treated in Thailand for suspected severe alcohol poisoning after consuming tainted drinks in neighboring Laos, Australian media reported Tuesday.",
      "The two 19-year-old women were on a backpacking vacation in Laos when they became ill in the tourist town of Vang Vieng, The Age newspaper in the women\u2019s hometown of Melbourne reported.",
      "Duong Duc Toan, manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel, said Tuesday that staff were told by other guests that the two women were unwell after they failed to check out as planned on Nov. 13, and they arranged transport to a hospital for them.",
      "He said that two days earlier the women had joined more than 100 other guests for free shots of Lao vodka offered by the hostel as a gesture of hospitality. He said no other guest reported any issue, adding that the women had then gone for a night out, returning in the early hours of the morning.",
      "Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that it was providing consular assistance to two Australians and their families in Thailand, but couldn't provide further information for privacy reasons.",
      "\u201cOur thoughts are with them at this deeply distressing time,\u201d the office said.",
      "They were then transported to Thailand and are being treated at hospitals in Bangkok and Udon Thani, The Age reported. Their parents have flown in to be with them.",
      "It wasn't clear what the two drank, but methanol is sometimes used as the alcohol in mixed drinks at disreputable bars and can cause severe poisoning or death.",
      "Australian media also reported that two Danish tourists died after consuming tainted alcohol in Vang Vieng at the same time as the Australian women, but it was not immediately possible to confirm details.",
      "Asked about media reports, Denmark\u2019s Foreign Ministry told The Associated Press that \u201ctwo Danish citizens have passed away in Laos\u201d but that it could not provide specifics for \u201creasons of confidentiality in personal matters.\u201d",
      "Vang Vieng is a tourist town particularly popular among backpackers seeking partying and adventure sports. Businesses appeared to be going on as usual Tuesday evening in the surrounding neighborhood of the hostel bustling with bars and food stalls.",
      "Jasmine Antonius, a Dutch tourist who has been in Vang Vieng for three days, said that she tried to become more careful with drinks after she heard about the case.",
      "\u201cI think sometimes you\u2019re not really watching how your drinks are being made,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel now it\u2019s a wake up call for many people since this happened. So I hope people would take more precaution because it\u2019s really sad.\u201d",
      "It wasn't immediately possible to verify reports that other tourists were also poisoned in the same incident.",
      "Toan, the hostel manager, said he hoped the investigation would clear its name, but for now the hostel has stopped giving free shots to its guests."

      "TOKYO -- Japan racked up a trade deficit in October for a fourth straight month as a weak yen and rising energy prices kept import costs high.",
      "The trade deficit, which amounts to a nation\u2019s imports subtracted from its exports, totaled 461 billion yen ($3 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday.",
      "Exports grew 3.1% in October from a year earlier, picking up pace over recent months, as shipments of equipment for semiconductor production increased.",
      "But imports, up 0.4% from a year earlier, were still bigger than exports.",
      "A major uncertainty over trade is looming because of the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president, in part because he favors sharp increases in tariffs.",
      "Exports are a chief engine of growth for Japan, the home of Toyota Motor Corp., although such manufacturers have moved production and investment abroad.",
      "New Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been busy meeting the leaders of Asian nations, as well as Europe and South America, to forge economic and trade relations, as well as security ties. Ishiba, who has yet to meet Trump, was recently in Brazil for the Group of 20 summit.",
      "A weakening currency, which tends to accompany trailing growth, is another worry for Japan. The U.S. dollar has been trading at about 155 Japanese yen recently, up from 140-yen levels a year ago.",
      "Inflation and rising energy prices are pushing up import costs, while slowing global demand dampens exports.",
      "But the recent fall in overseas demand is believed to be partly due to temporary disruptions like a typhoon, while the drop in exports is related to auto production disruptions in Japan.",
      "By region, exports rose to the rest of Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong. Exports to the U.S. slipped slightly.",

      "Here are some things to know about Duffy.",
      "Duffy, 53, is an attorney who represented Wisconsin in the House for nine years after he was elected as part of the tea party wave in 2010. He served from 2011 to 2019, when he resigned, citing a need to care for his large family. In the House, Duffy was a member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairman of its subcommittee on housing and insurance.",

      "When he first ran for Congress, Duffy was largely considered an underdog. He attracted national attention for campaign ads in which he wore a red flannel shirt and chopped trees. He told voters he came from a \u201clong line of lumberjacks\u201d and would bring his axe to Washington.",

      "Edmunds\u2019 car experts have four recommendations, including one that you\u2019d never guess could be just as enjoyable to drive in the winter snow as it is on dry summer roads. They\u2019re listed below in alphabetical order and are capped to stay under $40,000. All prices include the destination charge.",

Its turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine provides 310 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque is plenty for powering through snow drifts or towing up to 7,700 pounds.",

Only the Grand Touring trim level slides in under our $40,000 price cap, but it\u2019s well equipped with leather upholstery, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors.

      "The chief executive of Delta Air Lines says the incoming Trump administration will be a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d for airlines after what he called government \u201coverreach\u201d under President Joe Biden",
      "The chief executive of Delta Air Lines says the incoming Trump administration will be a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d for airlines after what he calls government \u201coverreach\u201d under President Joe Biden.",
      "The airline industry has chafed under consumer-protection regulations imposed by the Biden administration. And Delta is facing a federal investigation into its slow recovery from a global technology outage this summer.",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian made the comment as he and fellow Delta executives prepared to host Wall Street analysts at an investor day Wednesday in Atlanta.",
      "Bastian noted that President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to reform the federal government and reduce its size.",
      "The airline executive said Trump promised \u201cto take a fresh look at the regulatory environment, the bureaucracy that exists in government, the level of overreach that we have seen over the last four years within our industry. I think that will be a breath of fresh air.\u201d",
      "Southwest Airlines CEO Robert Jordan struck a similar tone after a speech last week in Dallas.",
      "\u201cI think there is a general thought that the new administration could be a little more business-friendly,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWe are hopeful for a DOT (Department of Transportation) that is maybe a little less aggressive in terms of regulating or rule-making.\u201d",
      "Delta used its investor day to build support for the company, which reported a profit of $2.6 billion in the first nine months of this year after earning an industry-leading $4.6 billion last year.",
      "The airline stood by its previous forecast that adjusted profit in the fourth quarter will be between $1.60 and $1.85 per share. The company said its 2025 revenue will rise by a mid-single-digit percentage over 2024. Analysts expect a 6% increase, according to a FactSet survey.",
      "Consumer advocates are wary of a second Trump administration, fearing that it could try to roll back a rule requiring automatic refunds after canceled flights and another that requires airlines to advertise the full price of fares upfront, including mandatory fees and taxes.",
      "On Monday, the airline industry trade group praised Trump's pick for transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin and reality-TV star who is a co-host of \u201cThe Bottom Line\u201d on Fox Business. Duffy lobbied for U.S. airlines and their unions during a dispute with Persian Gulf carriers.",
      "But Accountable.US, a watchdog nonprofit group, said putting Duffy in charge of the department that oversees airlines was a sign that Trump is \"putting his friends and their corporate special interests ahead of American consumers.\u201d",
      "Bastian did not specify which Biden regulations he considered overreach, but Delta and other carriers are suing the Transportation Department to kill a rule requiring greater transparency over fees that the carriers charge their passengers.",
      "The group Airlines for America said the rule would confuse consumers by giving them too much information. An appeals court panel blocked enforcement of the rule while the airlines' lawsuit goes ahead.",
      "Airlines also oppose an inquiry that the administration recently launched into their frequent-flyer programs. Delta has received more than $2.4 billion in revenue from its loyalty program so far this year.",
      "But the hardest blow against Delta could come from a Transportation Department investigation into the airline's slow recovery from a technology outage in July. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said investigators were focusing on whether Delta\u2019s treatment of passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights violated federal consumer-protection rules.",
      "Southwest Airlines reached a $140 million settlement after a Transportation Department investigation into a similar but larger breakdown in service in December 2022.",
      "Delta initially said it was cooperating with the investigation. In October, Delta sued CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity provider whose faulty upgrade to Microsoft computers triggered the outage."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 03:14:16 -0500",
    "summary": "This year, Russian missile attacks have knocked out about 50% of Ukraine's power generation, a major threat as winter looms",
    "story": [
      "This year, Russian missile attacks have knocked out about 50% of Ukraine's power generation, a major threat as winter looms",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, pulls out a piece of paper with bar charts showing how much new electricity his company has brought online this year in the country versus how much Russian bombs have destroyed.",
      "Total electricity goes up, then down, then up, then down \u2014 capturing the company's constant rebuilding each time Russian missile attacks take out a facility, which include wind and solar farms and thermal (coal or gas-fired) generating stations. The Russian strikes are part of a campaign to target energy infrastructure to reduce power in Ukraine as winter looms.",
      "\u201cWhat other choice do we have?\u201d said Timchenko during an interview on the sidelines of this year's U.N. climate talks, taking place in Azerbaijan. \u201cSit and wait and pray that they don't hit us, or do our job and bring lights back to our people?\u201d",
      "The nearly three-year-long Russia-Ukraine war, which has left large swaths of Ukraine destroyed, has accelerated a transition to clean energy. At Ukraine's pavilion at COP29, on display is a large smashed solar panel, destroyed in an attack this year.",
      "Russian forces continue to make small but steady gains in capturing Ukrainian territory at a time when there are questions about how much the United States, which has been providing weapons and money, will continue to support the country once President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could quickly end the war if elected, although he hasn't said how.",
      "Whatever the future, the decentralized nature of some clean energies, in particular wind and solar, has allowed Ukraine to quickly restore power in ways that would be impossible with Ukraine's more traditional energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants.",
      "In centralized systems, all power is generated and sent to the grid over transmission lines from the same area. That means if the plant goes down, say in an attack, a large section of grid, or even the entire grid, comes to a halt. By contrast, wind and solar installations are usually more scattered, so less of the system goes down with one hit, and if the solar is on rooftops, the impact can be even more limited.",
      "Attacks on two DTEK solar farms last spring is a good example. They destroyed many solar panels and some of the transformers, which step up voltage for long distances or step it down for use in homes. Replacing the transformers and swapping out destroyed panels allowed the farms, which generate 400 megawatts, to be back up in seven days.",
      "Timchenko said an attack on a thermal generating station, which experienced a similar amount of damage, took three to four months to rebuild.",
      "\u201cThat's the difference between centralized and so-called decentralized generation. It's much more resistant and difficult to destroy,\u201d said Timchenko.",
      "Geoffrey Pyatt, assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, said that Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have evolved. In 2022 and 2023, they focused on transformers.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians were incredibly efficient in working around those attacks. So Putin changed his tactics beginning in March to go after generation capacity,\" said Pyatt, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Since then, about 50% of Ukraine's total power generation has been knocked out, leaving mostly nuclear, some hydropower and large new renewable projects, like a wind farm being built by DTEK, he added.",
      "Renewable and other infrastructure projects are financed by partnerships between governments and businesses, spreading out the risk, since there is no guarantee that something built isn't destroyed by missiles. In June, turbine maker GE Vernova and manufacturer Honeywell announced plans to partner with DTEK for major wind and battery storage projects in Ukraine.",
      "Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer for GE Vernova, said that developing public-private partnerships was key to lowering risk and making investment more attractive. Ukraine's resistance was also an inspiration, Martella told a panel on Ukrainian renewables at COP29.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re humbled by the fact that Ukraine has done something no one has ever done before, which is to maintain the grid in a war-torn environment,\u201d said Martella.",
      "Pyatt, a former ambassador in Ukraine, said he has seen widespread support for Ukraine's energy systems in the G7, a group of leading industrialized nations.",
      "While making clear he couldn't speak for the incoming Trump administration, Pyatt said he believed support for Ukraine in the energy sector would \u201ccontinue in any scenario.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you start to get big American companies like GE and Fluxus and Honeywell involved in energy reconstruction, and there\u2019s going to be billions of dollars of energy reconstruction,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "British farmers have descended on Parliament to protest a tax hike they say will deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to struggling family farms",
      "LONDON -- With banners, bullhorns and toy tractors, thousands of British farmers descended on Parliament on Tuesday to protest a tax hike they say will deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to struggling family farms.",
      "U.K. farmers are rarely as militant as their European neighbors, and Britain has not seen large-scale protests like those that have snarled cities in France and other European countries. Now, though, farmers say they will step up their action if the government doesn\u2019t listen.",
      "The flashpoint is the government\u2019s decision in its budget last month to scrap a tax break dating from the 1990s that exempts agricultural property from inheritance tax. From April 2026, farms worth more than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) face a 20% tax when the owner dies and they are passed on to the next generation.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s mad,\u201d said Olly Harrison, co-organizer of a protest that flooded the streets around Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s Downing Street office. He said many \u201cwant to take to the streets and block roads and go full French.\u201d",
      "Organizers urged protesters not to bring farm machinery into central London, though a handful of tractors drove past Downing Street festooned with signs saying \u201cthe final straw\u201d and \u201cno farmers, no food.\u201d",
      "They were cheered by a crowd that police estimated at 13,000. Some held signs proclaiming \u201cStand with a farmer, not Starmer.\u201d",
      "Children on toy tractors looped round Parliament Square after a rally addressed by speakers including former \u201cTop Gear\u201d TV host and celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson. Another 1,800 farmers were invited into Parliament for a \u201cmass lobby\u201d organized by the National Farmers\u2019 Union.",
      "\u201cThe human impact of this policy is simply not acceptable, it\u2019s wrong,\" NFU President Tom Bradshaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s kicking the legs out from under British food security.\"",
      "Volatile weather exacerbated by climate change, global instability and the upheaval caused by Britain\u2019s 2020 departure from the European Union have all added to the burden on farmers. Many feel the Labour Party government\u2019s tax change, part of an effort to raise billions of pounds to fund public services, is the last straw.",
      "\u201cFour out of the last five years, we\u2019ve lost money,\u201d said Harrison, a fifth-generation farmer who grows cereal crops near Liverpool in northwest England. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s kept me going is doing it for my kids. And maybe a little bit of appreciation on the land allows you to keep borrowing, to keep going. But now that\u2019s just disappeared overnight.\u201d",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left government says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farms -\u2013 about 75% \u2014 will not have to pay inheritance tax, and various loopholes mean that a farming couple can pass on an estate worth up to 3 million pounds ($3.9 million) to their children tax-free. The 20% levy is half the 40% inheritance tax paid on other land and property in the U.K.",
      "Starmer spokeswoman Camilla Marshall said the tax decision had been \u201cdifficult\u201d but was not being reconsidered.",
      "Supporters of the tax say it will recoup money from wealthy people who have bought up agricultural land as an investment, driving up the cost of farmland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become the most effective way for the super rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax,\u201d Environment Secretary Steve Reed wrote in The Daily Telegraph, adding that high land prices were \u201crobbing young farmers of the dream of owning their own farm.\u201d",
      "But the farmers\u2019 union says more than 60% of working farms could face a tax hit. And while farms may be worth a lot on paper, profits are often small. Government figures show that income for most types of farms fell in the year ending February 2024, in some cases by more than 70%. Average farm income ranged from about 17,000 pounds ($21,000) for grazing livestock farms to 143,000 pounds ($180,000) for specialist poultry farms.",
      "The last decade has been turbulent. Many British farmers backed Brexit as a chance to get out of the EU\u2019s complex and much-criticized Common Agricultural Policy. Since then, the U.K. has brought in changes such as paying farmers to restore nature and promote biodiversity, as well as for producing food.",
      "Some farmers have welcomed those moves, but many feel goodwill was squandered through bureaucratic bungling \u2014 by previous Conservative governments as well as Starmer's Labour administration \u2014 alongside a failure of subsidies to keep up with inflation and new trade deals with countries including Australia and New Zealand that have opened the door to cheap imports.",
      "National Farmers\u2019 Union Deputy President David Exwood said the government has \u201ccompletely blown their trust with the industry.\u201d",
      "Heidi Fermor, who helps run her family\u2019s fruit, vegetable and arable farm in southeast England, said she was attending her first protest because government officials had \u201cno idea\u201d about the reality of farmers\u2019 lives.",
      "\u201cFarming is hard. We\u2019re very privileged, we have a lovely life, but it\u2019s hard,\" she said. \"We want to farm for life, for future generations, not just for today.\u201d"

      "Damage was detected Monday to the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) from Finland's capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Another cable between Lithuania and Sweden was also damaged.",
      "Speaking in Brussels, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat, and that Europe needs to take a broad approach to defense. He said the damage to the two cables was \u201ca very clear sign that something is afoot.\"",
      "\u201cNo one believes these cables were severed by mistake, and I also don't want to believe versions that it was anchors that by chance caused damage to these cables,\u201d he said at a regular meeting of European Union defense ministers.",
      "\u201cSo we have to state \u2014 without knowing in concrete terms who it came from \u2014 that this is a hybrid action. And we also have to assume \u2014 without already knowing it, obviously \u2014 that this is sabotage.\u201d",
      "The foreign ministries of Finland and Germany had already said Monday evening that the damage raised suspicion of sabotage.",
      "They said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that \u201cour European security is not only under threat from Russia\u2018s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.\u201d",
      "The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d be safeguarded.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hal Steinbrenner wants his relationship with Juan Soto to be similar to his friendship with Aaron Judge and Gerrit Cole, and the New York Yankees owner emphasized the team's commitment to continually improve its roster if the star free-agent outfielder stays in the Bronx.",
      "Steinbrenner said the Yankees delegation at Monday\u2019s meeting included team president Randy Levine, general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone and senior adviser for baseball operations Omar Minaya.",
      "\u201cWe had a good meeting. It was a very honest back-and-forth dialogue, a couple hours long,\" Steinbrenner said Wednesday.",
      "Asked how confident he was about keeping Soto, Steinbrenner said: \u201cNo idea. We'll be in the mix. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe listen to our fans, right? Our fans really enjoyed having him in New York,\u201d Steinbrenner added. \"He is definitely a significant part of why we got to the World Series. So, I\u2019ve got ears. I know what\u2019s expected of me.\"",
      "The meeting lasted about two hours and took place at a hotel near Newport Beach, California, near the office of Soto's agent, Scott Boras, a person familiar with the session said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because those details were not announced.",
      "Soto was acquired from San Diego last December and the Yankees reached the World Series for the first time since 2009.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t get to know each other that well,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cI was told that he is someone that when he\u2019s in the clubhouse, he is in a zone like no other, and with players like that I just don\u2019t like interrupting that process and pulling somebody aside, dragging them into Boone's office and having conversations. But we did talk about that in California and should he be back next year, I made it clear that the kind of relationship I would like is the kind of relationship I have with Gerrit (Cole) and with Aaron Judge.\u201d",
      "Soto also is meeting with other teams and financial talks likely won't start until next week. The Yankees entered the postseason with a $311 million payroll, second behind the Mets at $332 million.",

There\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Steinbrenner. \u201cYear after year after year after year, payrolls similar to this year and the luxury taxes they produce are not sustainable, not feasible, and that\u2019s the case for the vast majority of owners, maybe all the owners, year after year after year. It doesn\u2019t mean in any given year I can\u2019t do what I want to do. We\u2019ve got the ability to sign any player we want to sign.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course it's a concern,\" Steinbrenner said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s going to hurt a little bit no matter where it goes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did not play a clean World Series. I think we all know that,\u201d Steinbrenner said of the five-game loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. \u201cBut those fundamentals got us to the World Series. Our play for the most part was solid during the course of the year. That's why we won a pennant for the first time in 15 years, but no doubt in the World Series they just played better than us.\u201d",
      "The loss to the Dodgers remained on his mind.",
      "\u201cIt stung. It still stings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you\u2019re that close and you don\u2019t get there, it stays with you for a while.\u201d",
      "After Cole exercised his right to opt out, the Yankees wouldn't void that right by adding a $36 million salary for 2029. The pitcher then decided to stay, and the sides will keep talking.",
      "\u201cWe want Gerrit to be a Yankee for life. I believe he wants to be a Yankee for life,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cAnd adding one more year or not adding one more year should have no meaning when it comes to that.\u201d",
      "Boone enters next season in the option year of his contract. Steinbrenner said a new deal may be discussed.",
      "\u201cI'm going to have discussions with Cashman, yes, in the very near future, but there's no huge rush to it,\" Steinbrenner said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s the right thing to do for their fan base, many of whom are my neighbors and friends,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cReally if it wasn\u2019t for Tampa, they would have been moving out of Tampa because there\u2019s no other site size-wise, the amount of premium and club space we have, major league-ready field, major league-ready lights. All that, plus everything we\u2019ve done to the clubhouse.\u201d",
      "Lights will be added to an outside field for the Class A Tampa Tarpons, and Steinbrenner said the Rays will improve the visitors clubhouse.",

Gallaudet has not won a game in the NCAA Tournament since 2006, and three victories in the regional this week in Newport News, Virginia, would put the school into the Elite Eight for the first time.",
      "Getting to this point was a culmination of adding a couple of transfers, taking a trip overseas to learn more about each other on and off the court, and players honing their communication with signing while opponents talk to and hear each other during fast-paced matches.",
      "\u201cCommunicating throughout the school year, in our practices, we try to have more visual language, and other opponents are seeing something new that they\u2019ve never seen until they face us,\u201d said Boren, who played football, baseball, basketball and tennis at the Texas School for the Deaf before getting a master's at Gallaudet and beginning his coaching career here in 2005. \u201cMost offenses rely on audible plays, especially in the middle hitters. And when it comes to setters, there\u2019s an in sync communication that generally happens, whereas it\u2019s a little bit different for us.\u201d",
      "Different has been great for Gallaudet, which leads Division III in team service aces and ranks second in aces per set and third in hitting percentage. The transfer combination of setter Ella Gamble and outside hitter Brielle Worley has made all the difference after each player joined following concerns about being overlooked and isolated while playing for hearing teams.",
      "\u201cAt my past school, I felt like I struggled to get along with my teammates and my coaches, being able to connect,\u201d said Gamble, a hard of hearing athlete who's in her second season after joining from Carson-Newman. \u201cI had to make sure I was accommodated for. And I can speak fine for myself, and when I have my implants, I can hear. But I still didn\u2019t totally feel like I belonged on the team or I connected with the team.\u201d",
      "Worley started at Division I North Texas, then spent a year at UT-Tyler before finally finding a home at Gallaudet.",
      "\u201cIt was always a struggle for me to rely on verbal communication because I couldn\u2019t hear very well, so really when I came here and I finally learned to sign pretty fluently, it felt more natural,\u201d said Worley, who like Gamble is hard of hearing but can speak verbally. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we needed to scream and make noise for no reason because that\u2019s what it started to feel like at my other universities. I think it\u2019s just a better match for me, and I think it\u2019s a really effective way of communicating.\u201d",
      "Effective, especially because players on other teams do not often understand ASL and that nonverbal language is a unique advantage in setting up plays or game strategy. Senior outside hitter Cassidy Perry said she trusts where her teammates are going to be, knows she can gesture to make sure setters put the ball at the right height and gets signs from the bench to make sure the entire operation goes smoothly.",
      "\u201cWe can give each other just quick cues,\u201d Perry said in ASL. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing a dig or a set or whatever it may be, we\u2019re able to communicate with each other at the same time. Where hearing teams are able to speak to each other, we can sign.\u201d",
      "Perry remembers an important meeting early in the season about leaving last year in the past, but it was an appearance and silver medal finish at the World Deaf Volleyball Championship in Japan that provided the team's foundation for this success.",
      "\"Bonding definitely happened on that trip,\" Gamble said. \u201cIt was kind of proving to ourselves that we can compete at a high level, and this year I feel like we went into the season with a lot more confidence than we had last year. We had a lot more trust with each other. We have so much better chemistry.\u201d",
      "So good that Zarembka feels it has provided Gallaudet's players with a deep connection during a season she doesn't want to end any time soon.",
      "\"We\u2019ve got a lot of good memories, a lot of wins and I\u2019ll miss a lot of that forever,\" Zarembka \u201cI feel like this is truly a one-of-a-kind experience for me, and I\u2019ll definitely miss the team once the season\u2019s over.\u201d",

      "The Washington Capitals put Alex Ovechkin on injured reserve and recalled fellow Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from the minors",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin is on injured reserve, and the Washington Capitals are coming to grips with playing without their superstar captain for the coming weeks.",
      "Ovechkin is considered week-to-week with a lower left leg injury, and going on IR rules him out for at least the next three games. The absence puts a pause on his pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL career goals record and takes the best pure scorer of this generation off the ice until further notice.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the hottest guy in the league, and he\u2019s chasing something bigger than hockey,\u201d longtime teammate Tom Wilson said after practice Wednesday. \u201cI think everyone in the hockey world just feels that bit of letdown, that emotion that you\u2019re just pulling for him and he\u2019s putting everything he has into it. He feels all that pressure. The whole world of hockey is just rooting him on. So, to come in (to the locker room) and see that he was hurt, it hurt a little bit as a teammate, but at the end of the day, that\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was injured in a shin-on-shin collision with Utah's Jack McBain on Monday night. The 39-year-old winger went down in obvious pain, then tried to skate and test out the leg minutes later before limping down the tunnel.",
      "Coach Spencer Carbery confirmed it was not a season-ending injury and expects a more specific diagnosis and timeframe to be available Thursday after further evaluation by doctors. Carbery described Ovechkin's initial reaction as \u201cbummed,\" while veteran defenseman John Carlson said Ovechkin was handling it \u201clike a human being,\u201d with plenty of emotions attached.",
      "Even Washington's next opponent isn't thrilled.",
      "\u201cYou never want to see players go down,\u201d said Colorado coach Jared Bednar, whose Avalanche face the Capitals on Thursday night for their second of two meetings over the past week. \"But then you put in a situation like Ovi where he\u2019s chasing greatness, and you want to see him healthy and be able to pursue that: a great start to the season, even getting to the night that he got hurt. Hopefully it\u2019s not long and that he\u2019s able to get back. Injuries are part of it. I think everyone has to deal with them, but I\u2019d certainly like to see him get healthy and continue to pursue that goal.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin scored 15 goals in his first 18 games this season to take the league lead and move 27 back of passing Gretzky. Before the injury, he was on pace to break the record sometime in February.",
      "That likely will have to wait until the spring or perhaps early next season after this injury, which could lead to Ovechkin's longest absence of his two-decade NHL career. He has missed just 59 games total and only 35 because of injury since debuting in 2005.",
      "\u201cI was having a little deja vu about just being in the locker room before we go on the ice and \u2014 almost every time \u2014 he\u2019s there,\u201d Carlson said. \"There\u2019s minutes to be played and goals to be scored.\u201d",
      "The Capitals put Ovechkin on IR and injured winger Sonny Milano on long-term IR with an undisclosed upper-body injury and recalled young Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from Hershey of the American Hockey League. Carbery does not want Miroshnichenko to think he has to fill in for Ovechkin and is still deciding how to proceed with the lineup moving forward.",
      "One possibility on the top line is Jakub Vrana, who along with Ovechkin, Wilson, Carlson and recent trade reacquisition Lars Eller is among the few players remaining from the 2018 Stanley Cup championship team. But it will take more than one player to make up for Ovechkin being out for however long.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to face the reality,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s hard. He\u2019s our captain and everything. But at the same time, it is what it is. And we\u2019re going to prepare on winning games without him.\u201d",

      "Rafael Nadal's retirement from tennis serves as a reminder that for all of his Grand Slam titles and other successes, his greatest legacy might be the qualities that inspired Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek and other younger players",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- Not surprisingly, Rafael Nadal couldn\u2019t take a step around the grounds of the Davis Cup Final 8 in recent days without hearing requests for a handshake or a selfie. And that was just from the other professional tennis players, to speak nothing of the fans.",
      "The significance of Nadal\u2019s retirement is lost on no one inside or outside the sport he is walking away from at age 38 after a litany of injuries, and for all of the well-documented success he enjoyed, his greatest legacy might be the way he inspired other players. The 22-time Grand Slam champion and all-time great of the game lost the last match of his career as Spain was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals as Tuesday turned to Wednesday.",
      "The last man to face \u2014 and beat \u2014 Nadal, 80th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, who is 29, spoke after his 6-4, 6-4 victory about idolizing the Spaniard. Many current players grew up watching Nadal, admiring him for his skill \u2014 from the big, topspin left-handed forehands to the pinpoint volleys and everything in between \u2014 and his relentless nature, his commitment to seeking improvement and, maybe most of all, his off-court humility.",
      "He set an example for others, from contemporaries Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic or Serena Williams, to members of the following generations, including heir apparent Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cI was a big Rafa fan. Used to wear all his kits, his shoes, everything. A lot of neon colors,\u201d said Ben Shelton, a 22-year-old member of the U.S. team that faces Australia on Thursday, when the other quarterfinal is defending champion Italy and No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner against Argentina. \u201cAnd being a lefty, he\u2019s a guy that I have always kind of watched and tried to learn things from. One of those perfect examples of how to do things on and off the court, how to handle the press, how to win with class, how to lose with class.\u201d",
      "That sentiment was echoed by player after player, many of whom were thrilled to be on-site for his farewell.",
      "\u201cFor him to have this as his finishing point, it\u2019s an honor for the event,\" said Yannick Hanfmann, part of the German squad that defeated Canada 2-0 on Wednesday and will meet the Netherlands in the semifinals on Friday. \"He\u2019s present everywhere. In the training area, when he\u2019s walking around, you see the people looking and trying to get some pictures, here and there. He\u2019s got this aura that already was big, but now that this is the end, it\u2019s maybe more important.\u201d",
      "Hanfmann and others were struck by Nadal's dedication to chasing every shot down. By a refusal to accept defeat, no matter the deficit. By his longevity and consistency \u2014 nearly 18 full years in a row ranked in the top 10; 10 consecutive years with at least one major title \u2014 and his dizzying peaks, including the 14 French Open championships that earned him the \u201cKing of Clay\u201d nickname.",
      "His unfailing politeness, seen in such gestures as when he would say goodbye to every volunteer on his way out of a tournament or, just this Monday, when he arrived at Spain\u2019s team news conference and made a beeline for the stenographer to shake the hand of the person who would be typing up the transcript of the Q-and-A session for reporters.",
      "\u201c The titles, the numbers, are there, so people probably know that, but the way I would like to be remembered is as a good person from a small village in Mallorca,\u201d Nadal said during a tear-filled post-match ceremony at the sold-out Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena, where thousands serenaded him with a chorus of \u201cRaaaa-faaa! Raaaa-faaa!\u201d",
      "\u201cJust a kid that followed their dreams,\u201d he said, \u201c (and) worked as hard as possible.\u201d",
      "No opponent, or any observer for that matter, could ever question his effort, even as injury after injury made things tougher, especially over the past two seasons.",
      "No one ever doubted his drive to get better.",
      "\"I really will miss watching him on court,\u201d said Iga Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion and long an unabashed fan of Nadal\u2019s. \u201cHonestly, he was the only player I watched, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to watch tennis at all now. He\u2019s a huge inspiration.\u201d",
      "That last word, or a variation of it, was used over and over again as tributes to Nadal were offered.",
      "So were \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cpassion,\u201d \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201crole model.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me,\u201d said Alcaraz, a 21-year-old Spaniard with four major trophies, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to accept that Rafael Nadal is going to retire, honestly.\u201d",

      "Romania was awarded a 3-0 win by default for the game in Bucharest last Friday, though it was ordered by UEFA to play its first home game in a World Cup qualifying group next year in an empty stadium. That was punishment for \u201cracist\u201d chants by Romanian fans targeting neighboring Hungary.",
      "The default result, and the award of three points to Romania, did not affect the final standings in the teams' third-tier Nations League group. Even a 3-0 default win for Kosovo, tying both teams on 15 points, would have left Romania top of the standings on a tiebreaker of overall goal difference.",
      "The 2026 World Cup qualifying process in Europe was affected by the UEFA verdict on Wednesday.",
      "Romania's new tally of 18 points, instead of 16, lifted it above Sweden and North Macedonia in the ranking of Nations League group winners. That could be key next November when entries to the World Cup qualifying playoffs are finalized.",

      "The state of Romania does not recognize Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence in 2008 from Serbia.",

      "Dalton Knecht could only shrug when he buried his fourth consecutive 3-pointer and sent the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 entire arena into a frenzy",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Dalton Knecht could only shrug when he buried his fourth consecutive 3-pointer and sent the Los Angeles Lakers ' entire arena into a frenzy.",
      "That was a very specific shrug by the Lakers rookie, however \u2014 the one made famous by Michael Jordan in the 1992 NBA Finals after a legendary 3-point flurry.",
      "\u201cRui (Hachimura) was talking to me about (how) I need to get a 3-point celebration,\u201d Knecht said. \u201cI didn't know what to do, so I just gave the shrug.\u201d",
      "A shrug is also the increasingly accurate response to the question many NBA fans are asking after Knecht's 37-point barrage Tuesday night: Just how did Knecht fall to the Lakers with the 17th pick in last summer's draft?",
      "Knecht torched the Utah Jazz with nine 3-pointers in the Lakers' 124-118 victory, tying the single-game rookie record. He got on a major roll in the third quarter, hitting those four consecutive 3s before adding three free throws and another triple \u2014 and yet another 3 at the start of the fourth.",
      "\u201cI just got in a groove,\u201d Knecht said. \u201cMy teammates found me, and they were looking for me every time. They made it easy for me. I just had to get open and get the shot up.\u201d",
      "Knecht scored 21 points in the third quarter, and he had 21 consecutive points for the Lakers spanning the third and fourth. Although he didn't score again, he had staked Los Angeles to a lead that proved insurmountable with the latest demonstration of his formidable shooting skill.",
      "\u201cHe was phenomenal tonight,\u201d Anthony Davis said. \u201cWhen you're hot like that, he's special to watch. Anytime he's shooting the ball like that, it definitely gives us energy.\u201d",
      "Knecht moved into the Lakers' starting lineup four games ago, and he has been outstanding in his increased role. He is averaging 24.3 points per game while going an astonishing 21 for 31 on 3-pointers.",
      "The Lakers have spent years trying to find a catch-and-shoot option to complement Davis and LeBron James. Although the sample size is still relatively small just 14 games into the season, Knecht appears to be exactly what the Lakers have been seeking on the perimeter.",
      "\u201cHis shot-making gets us going,\u201d coach JJ Redick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real weapon for our group. Beyond just the score, it\u2019s a weapon that energizes us.\u201d",
      "And when Knecht gets into the type of rhythm he found against Utah, he thrills his teammates \u2014 and even inspires fond memories for his rookie coach, who was a bit of a sharpshooter himself during his 15-year NBA career.",
      "\u201cIt's the flow state,\u201d Redick said. \"You're not thinking. You're just perfectly in balance with the curvature of the earth, and the earth spinning on its axis a thousand miles an hour. You've let go, and the ball just feels weightless. It feels like everything is going to go in.\"",
      "Knecht appears to be a key rotation player already for the Lakers, who are off to an impressive 10-4 start to the season. Los Angeles has won six straight games, its longest winning streak in nearly four years.",
      "Knecht is also causing plenty of second-guessing in the league's front offices for letting him slip to the Lakers at No. 17.",
      "At the time, the reasoning was thought to be twofold: Knecht is already 23 years old after playing five seasons of college basketball, and he also wasn't considered much of a defender.",
      "Those concerns feel increasingly foolish with each impressive game by the late-blooming wingman who spent two years in junior college and two more at Northern Colorado before transferring to Tennessee for a fifth collegiate season.",
      "Knecht was an All-American for the Volunteers, winning SEC Player of the Year honors while averaging 21.7 points per game. He caught the basketball world's attention \u2014 even in the Lakers' locker room, where James and Davis watched his games and Austin Reaves became a text friend well before the Lakers drafted him.",
      "\u201cI did not think he was going to fall to us,\u201d James said. \u201cI thought it would be impossible. I have no idea how that happened, but I\u2019m very grateful and very happy that he\u2019s here. I knew exactly what we was getting when he fell to 17.\u201d",

      "Sounds like a recipe for success.",
      "Unfortunately for the Bengals, it hasn't worked out that way so far.",
      "Cincinnati is mired in 10th place in the AFC with a 4-7 record despite having a chance to become the first team since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to have the league leader in yards passing, yards receiving and sacks in the same season.",
      "Six of the Bengals losses have come by seven points or fewer thanks to some missed field goals in key spots, defensive breakdowns and no go-ahead TD drives by Burrow and the offense in the fourth quarter.",
      "Burrow became the second QB in NFL history to lose consecutive starts when throwing for at least 350 yards and three TDs without an interception in a 34-27 loss to the Chargers on Sunday night. The Bengals rallied from 27-6 down to tie the score in the fourth before Evan McPherson missed two field goals and the Bengals punted in the final minute to set up the Chargers' game-winning drive.",
      "Burrow has thrown for 3,028 yards with 27 TDs and four interceptions this season. The seven previous QBs who threw for at least 3,000 yards and 25 TDs with five or fewer interceptions in the first 11 games combined for a 69-8 record compared to Burrow's 4-7 mark.",
      "Burrow isn't alone in putting up prolific numbers in Cincinnati with Chase leading the NFL with 73 catches, 1,056 yards and 12 TDs. Only four players since the merger led the NFL in those three categories for an entire season to win the Triple Crown: Cooper Kupp (2021), Steve Smith (2005), Sterling Sharpe (1992) and Jerry Rice (1990).",

      "The win improved Detroit to 9-1 for the best record after 10 games for the franchise since the team started 10-0 in 1934.",
      "The Lions fell behind 3-0 before scoring TDs on their first seven possessions, becoming the first team to do that since New England in 2007 against Buffalo. Only two teams in NFL history have won a game they trailed at any point by a larger margin than Detroit did, with Green Bay beating New Orleans 52-3 after falling behind 3-0 in 2005 and the Packers beating the Steelers 54-7 after trailing 7-0 in 1941.",

      "Jared Goff also bounced back from a five-interception performance in Week 10 against Houston by going 24 for 29 for 412 yards, four TDs and a \u201cperfect\u201d passer rating of 158.3. Goff had his second career game with at least 400 yards, four TDs and the highest attainable passer rating of 158.3, having also done it for the Rams against Minnesota in 2018.",
      "There have been only seven of those games in NFL history with Goff the only player to do it multiple times.",
      "Mike Tomlin has made an art out of pulling out wins when his offense can't reach the end zone.",
      "The Pittsburgh Steelers won for the second time this season without scoring a touchdown, getting six field goals from Chris Boswell in an 18-16 win over Baltimore on Sunday. Boswell also made six field goals in an 18-10 win over Atlanta in Week 1.",
      "The Steelers became the second team in the last 20 seasons to win multiple games in a season without a TD, joining the 2016 Rams.",

Tomlin's .333 win percentage when his team doesn't score a touchdown ranks first in that span among the 73 coaches who have had at least 10 games without a TD.",

      "Hill ran for 138 yards and three TDs on seven carries, caught eight passes for 50 yards and completed an 18-yard pass to help lead the Saints to the win. Hill became the first player in NFL history to rush for at least 100 yards and three TDs, have at least 50 yards receiving and throw for at least 10 yards.",
      "He did it by lining up all over the Saints offense with 10 snaps from the slot, eight at quarterback, six as a running back, four as a wide receiver and four as a tight end, according to NFL NextGen Stats. He became the first player in the NGS era beginning in 2016 to have at least four snaps at all five of those positions.",

      "Florida State's current recruiting class is shaping up to be as much of a debacle as anything that\u2019s happened on the field for the Seminoles over the past three months",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Coach Mike Norvell spent years slowly rebuilding at Florida State and then suddenly turned the Seminoles into a championship contender last season.",
      "His long-term plan included adding talented transfers, winning games and getting the program in position to recruit many of the state\u2019s top players. It appeared on track in 2023 as the Seminoles went unbeaten in the regular season and won the Atlantic Coast Conference title.",
      "Their current recruiting class, however, is shaping up to be as much of a debacle as anything that's happened on the field in the past three months. Florida State (1-9), the biggest disappointment in college football this season, has lost nearly as many recruits as games in 2024.",
      "Norvell's class is down to 11 after offensive lineman Daniel Pierre Louis flipped to Florida on Tuesday. Pierre Louis made the move after watching the Gators upset LSU on Saturday \u2014 nearly a week after Norvell fired three assistants, including offensive coordinator/offensive line coach Alex Atkins.",
      "The Seminoles also recently lost four-star quarterback Tramell Jones to Florida. Defensive end Javion Hilson and receivers CJ Wiley and Daylan McCutcheon also bailed on the skidding Seminoles. Their decisions came after defensive coordinator Adam Fuller and receivers coach Ron Dugans were let go.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for kids, but they also understand all the things that are in store for them,\" Norvell said. \"And the opportunity that\u2019s here has not changed. It\u2019s just about being able to share as much as I can with them, just the vision for what\u2019s ahead. We all know the expectation.\u201d",
      "Prospects surely believed they were committing to an FSU program on the rise, one that was expected to be in the mix for the College Football Playoff. Instead, the \u2018Noles are last in the Atlantic Coast Conference heading into Saturday\u2019s home game against lower-division Charleston Southern (1-9).",
      "And their recruiting class doesn\u2019t currently include a quarterback or a receiver, positions where a difference-maker is needed.",
      "Even where Norvell's class was built early, with commitments from four offensive linemen, there is doubt about how many others will stay put with Atkins gone.",
      "Norvell has had at least 17 high school signees in each of his first five classes in Tallahassee. But getting anywhere near that number appears daunting for an early signing period that has moved to Dec. 4. The potential lack of quality and quantity in the class could impact the program not just in 2025 but years down the road.",
      "While Norvell said he spent a good part of the bye week talking with candidates for his three staff openings, Florida State\u2019s commitments and targets might not know who their coordinators will be when signing day arrives.",
      "Norvell, meanwhile, likely will have to turn to the transfer portal again to find production and leadership. It's an area where Norvell found success consistently but also fell short in this past offseason.",
      "Regardless of how the roster is built, Norvell said it\u2019s not as easy as just going out and hiring assistants who are known as recruiters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the relationship, but you\u2019ve also got to have the development factor that ties into that, and then making sure that the evaluation piece of it is critical, too,\u201d Norvell said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019ve got to make sure that the guys that we\u2019re bringing are the right fit as coaches, players, everybody involved that really can embrace and help us advance in all those areas.\u201d",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Marquette\u2019s Kam Jones wants to spend this season honoring one of his high school coaches.",
      "He\u2019s off to a heck of a start.",
      "Jones recorded the third triple-double in Marquette history Tuesday night by posting 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in the 15th-ranked Golden Eagles\u2019 76-58 victory over No. 6 Purdue. It was his first game since learning about the death of Terry Tippett, who coached Jones his freshman year at Evangelical Christian in Memphis, Tennessee.",
      "Tippett died Saturday at age 79. He won six Tennessee state championships at three different high schools during a remarkable coaching career that ended in 2018, after Jones\u2019 freshman season at Evangelical Christian.",
      "\u201cI wanted to really dedicate this game to him and dedicate the rest of the season to him,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Jones\u2019 triple-double was the Golden Eagles\u2019 first since Dwyane Wade had 29 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in an 83-69 NCAA Tournament regional final victory over Kentucky that earned Marquette its most recent Final Four appearance in 2003.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be in that type of company,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Marquette\u2019s only other triple-double came when Tony Miller had 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists against Wisconsin on Dec. 31, 1994.",
      "Jones\u2019 13 rebounds and 10 assists both constituted career highs, showing how the 6-foot-5 senior is expanding his game.",
      "He led Marquette (5-0) in scoring each of the last two seasons averaging 15.1 points for their 2022-23 Big East championship team and 17.2 points for their 2023-24 Sweet 16 squad. But he was playing a complementary role to 2022-23 Big East player of the year Tyler Kolek and Oso Ighodaro, who both were selected in the second round of this year\u2019s NBA draft.",
      "With Kolek gone, Jones needed to develop into more of a distributor. He is scoring 22.6 points per game this season, but also averaging six assists. He never has finished a season with more than 2.4 assists per game.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s always had better ability as a playmaker than people might think, but his role was a little different when we had Tyler and Oso because those guys were such good passers and distributors and we needed him to think, score, score, score,\" Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. \u201cWe still need him to score, but he also has the ball in his hands more and we need him to create opportunities for other guys.\u201d",
      "Purdue coach Matt Painter, whose team was facing Marquette for a third straight season, noticed the difference in Jones\u2019 game.",
      "\u201cHe came here as a shooter,\u201d Painter said. \u201cNow he\u2019s a player.\u201d",
      "Jones was intent on getting others involved early in the game. He had just three points but six assists and seven rebounds in the first half. Ten of his 17 points came in the last 13 minutes of the game as Marquette expanded its lead.",
      "He finally got the 10th assist to complete the triple-double by finding Stevie Mitchell for a corner 3-pointer with 51 seconds left as Marquette snapped Purdue's 39-game nonconference regular-season winning streak.",
      "\u201cHe was like a seasoned veteran tonight,\u201d Painter said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill us until he had to, you know what I mean? He didn\u2019t come out and shoot pull-up 30-footers or take bad shots. We did a good job, gave him a lot of attention and the game just kind of went its way, and then all of a sudden he picked his spots at the right time and he dominated the game in other areas.\u201d",
      "It was the 10th time since the 1996-97 season that a player had a triple-double against a top-10 team, according to Sportradar.",
      "Jones' ability to impact the game in many ways other than scoring reflect the work he put in to become a more complete player.",
      "\u201cThey say what\u2019s done in the dark will come to light,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI was in the gym with Coach watching film \u2014 watching film before games, watching film late nights, early mornings, trying to constantly figure out ways to get better. That\u2019s the name of the game.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Vigils and other events are being held to draw attention to transgender people who have lost their lives due to violence in the past year",
      "Wednesday is Transgender Day of Remembrance, which focuses on trans people who have lost their lives because of violence. Here is what to know.",
      "Transgender Day of Remembrance is marked every Nov. 20 and began in 1999 to honor Rita Hester, a trans woman who was killed in Massachusetts.",
      "The day marks the end of Transgender Awareness Week, which is used to raise public knowledge about the transgender community and the issues they face.",
      "The Williams Institute at UCLA Law estimates that 1.6 million people in the U.S. ages 13 and older identify as transgender. And it says transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violence, including rape and assault.",
      "Candlelight vigils, memorials and other events are held to mark the day. The Human Rights Campaign also released its annual report on deaths of transgender people in conjunction with the day.",
      "International Transgender Day of Visibility, which is designed to bring attention to transgender people, is commemorated in March.",
      "At least 36 transgender people have died from violence in the 12 months since the last Day of Remembrance, the Human Rights Campaign said in its annual report. Since 2013, the organization has recorded the deaths from violence of 372 victims who were transgender and gender-expansive \u2014 which refers to someone with a more flexible range of gender identity or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system.",
      "The number of victims is likely higher because many deaths often aren't reported or are misreported, or misgendering of the victims leads to delays in their identification.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign said there was a slight increase from the previous year, when it identified at least 33 transgender victims of violence.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 10:02:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Residents of the Hawaii town devastated by last year's wildfire are awaiting the return of one of the nation's most prestigious basketball tournaments with mixed feelings",
    "story": [
      "Residents of the Hawaii town devastated by last year's wildfire are awaiting the return of one of the nation's most prestigious basketball tournaments with mixed feelings",
      "HONOLULU -- Three generations of TJ Rickard\u2019s family lost their homes in the deadly Maui wildfire more than a year ago, and he and his extended family still have not rebuilt. That leaves Rickard, a high school basketball coach, conflicted about next week's return of the storied Maui Invitational college tournament.",
      "Like many, Rickard is excited to have top-drawer basketball played in Lahaina\u2019s humble arena, but he worries people will think it's business as usual in his hometown. In truth, he says, Lahaina is still struggling after the fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes.",
      "\u201cNot even a minute drive away from where they play, there\u2019s houses that are burned down that are still waiting to be rebuilt,\u201d said Rickard, the boys head coach at Lahainaluna High School.",
      "Many residents are excited about the local exposure to high-caliber competition and the economic boost the Maui Invitational will bring. But there\u2019s also a fear that travelers might show disrespect by wandering into the Lahaina burn zone and taking photos of the devastation, or trigger unpleasant memories with questions about that catastrophic day.",
      "\u201cPeople are in a weird state right now over here because there\u2019s so much displacement and loss of community,\u201d said Jon Conrad, Lahainaluna's athletic director. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly sensitive and slightly charged environment.\u201d",
      "Boosters coming to Lahaina should know \u201cit\u2019s been a year and more, but things are still a little raw,\" Conrad said.",
      "The Maui Invitational will bring eight of the NCAA\u2019s best men\u2019s teams \u2014 including two-time defending champion UConn \u2014 to Lahaina\u2019s 2,400-seat gymnasium for three days.",
      "Last year, organizers moved the tournament to Honolulu instead of intruding on Lahaina when many survivors were still living in hotels and charred rubble littered properties. This year, they decided to bring the 40-year-old event back after meeting with the governor's office, the Hawaii Tourism Authority and Maui's mayor, said Tom Valdiserri, executive vice president of KemperSports LIVE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our home and we want to be there. And Maui is our ohana, frankly,\u201d Valdiserri said, using the Hawaiian word for family.",
      "Reconstruction is progressing slowly. The Army Corps of Engineers has fully cleared all residential lots and 91% of commercial lots of fire debris. Maui County has issued 133 building permits after receiving 291 applications. One property has been finished.",
      "Rickard\u2019s experience shows how challenging housing is even 15 months after the fire. The blaze burned down his grandparents' house and the in-law unit on their property where Rickard lived with his wife and dog. His parents\u2019 house a few lots away got torched. The blaze claimed a cousin's house across the street and another cousin's place the next street over. A great-aunt who lived down the road lost her house, too.",
      "Rickard now lives in an apartment a 45-minute drive away that's paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His relatives are living with friends or other family.",
      "Maui officials hope the tournament will help rebuild the tourism industry, which took a massive hit. In 2022, the last year the Maui Invitational was held in Lahaina, the competition brought 6,500 visitors and $24 million in spending to Maui, KemperSports LIVE said.",
      "University of Hawaii researchers said last month that fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in Lahaina's tourism industry still do. Those with jobs are working fewer hours, their report said.",
      "Rebuilding helps Javier Barberi cope with the disaster. His company, Hana Hou Hospitality, reopened a popular beachfront restaurant that was spared by the flames \u2014 Mala Ocean Tavern \u2014 eight months after the fire. He and his partners overhauled another restaurant and launched it as a new establishment called Coco Deck. To him, the tournament's return is a sign of hope.",
      "\u201cLike, hey, we used to have this. It was gone. Now it\u2019s back,\" Barberi said. \"That restaurant was gone. Now it\u2019s back. That house was gone, now it\u2019s being rebuilt. To see these things happen, it starts to bring things back to normal and bring Maui back.\u201d",
      "Jason Donez, general manager of Leilani's restaurant, remembers his daughter Lola meeting Mike Krzyzewski, Duke's head coach at the time, at a free-throw contest in 2018. The Hall of Fame coach told the 12-year-old she had a nice shot, she should stick with it and he would see her in college one day, Donez said.",
      "Today, Lola Donez is a freshman guard at Cal.",
      "Being around the teams helped her \u201cdream big,\u201d her father said.",
      "Tickets to the games this year range from $56 to $236 depending on the game and seat location, but local residents get about a 28% discount. Tournament organizers and teams will hold basketball clinics for local students.",
      "Organizers have reminded participating schools and their teams to be respectful, and the tournament website has the same message for fans. The athletes and their coaches say they understand.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s where you try to remind guys that we\u2019re very fortunate to be able to travel and do the things the way we do, and we\u2019re going to a community that had a huge devastation that none of us would want anyone go to through,\u201d said North Carolina assistant coach Sean May. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to have some compassion.\"",
      "\"But I think at the end, they\u2019re happy we\u2019re there, we\u2019re happy to be there, it\u2019s great for the community. And to me, it brings so much excitement.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.",
      "But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.",
      "That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.",
      "\u201cThese companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,\u201d said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThe broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.\u201d",
      "It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining \u2014 the \u201cP\u201d in ChatGPT \u2014 that involves AI systems \u201clearning\u201d from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",
      "However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work \u2014 such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.",
      "GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",
      "\u201cWith training, you\u2019re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.",
      "That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals \u2014 such as AMD and Intel \u2014 to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.",
      "D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 \u2014 a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.",
      "\u201cThere were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was \u2018you\u2019re too late,\u2019\u201d he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.",
      "Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.",
      "\u201cWe spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That\u2019s training, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge \u2014 and then you get rewarded for being efficient.\u201d",
      "The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \u2014 the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips \u2014 and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.",
      "The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months \u2014 if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.",
      "D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.",
      "While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.",
      "Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.",
      "\u201cThe dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cBuying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.\u201d",
      "Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.",
      "He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.",
      "Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.",
      "Sheth says the big concern right now is, \u201care we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI \u2014 human-like intelligence?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence \u2014 predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.",
      "\u201cBut then what about the rest?\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot be put on the same path.\u201d",
      "The other set of companies don\u2019t want to use very large AI models \u2014 it\u2019s too costly and uses too much energy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don\u2019t think they appreciate that. It\u2019s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,\u201d Sheth said.",

      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, were essentially flat Wednesday.",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid subscribers to its streaming Peacock channel jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Peacock was launched in 2020, and after a confusing, glitchy start, has taken off recently, boosted in part by the platform\u2019s success and popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.",
      "Peacock streamed all 329 medal events and over 5,000 hours of coverage during the Games, with viewers streaming more than 23 billion minutes of Olympic coverage, led by Peacock. That's a 40% increase over all previous Summer and Winter Olympics combined, Comcast said.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought",
      "NEW YORK -- Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought.",
      "Astronomers know that the universe is being pushed apart at an accelerating rate and they have puzzled for decades over what could possibly be speeding everything up. They theorize that a powerful, constant force is at play, one that fits nicely with the main mathematical model that describes how the universe behaves. But they can't see it and they don't know where it comes from, so they call it dark energy.",
      "It is so vast it is thought to make up nearly 70% of the universe \u2014 while ordinary matter like all the stars and planets and people make up just 5%.",
      "But findings published earlier this year by an international research collaboration of more than 900 scientists from around the globe yielded a major surprise. As the scientists analyzed how galaxies move they found that the force pushing or pulling them around did not seem to be constant. And the same group published a new, broader set of analyses Tuesday that yielded a similar answer.",
      "\u201cI did not think that such a result would happen in my lifetime,\u201d said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist at the University of Texas at Dallas who is part of the collaboration.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, it uses a telescope southwest of Tucson, Arizona to create a three-dimensional map of the universe over 11 billion years to see how galaxies have clustered throughout time and across space. That gives scientists information about how the universe evolved, and where it might be heading.",
      "The map they are building would not make sense if dark energy were a constant force, as it is theorized. Instead, the energy appears to be changing or weakening over time. If that is indeed the case, it would upend astronomers' standard cosmological model. It could mean that dark energy is very different than what scientists thought \u2014 or that there may be something else altogether going on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a time of great excitement, and also some head-scratching and confusion,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is not involved with the research.",
      "The collaboration's latest finding points to a possible explanation from an older theory: that across billions of years of cosmic history, the universe expanded and galaxies clustered as Einstein's general relativity predicted.",
      "The new findings aren't definitive. Astronomers say they need more data to overturn a theory that seemed to fit together so well. They hope observations from other telescopes and new analyses of the new data over the next few years will determine whether the current view of dark energy stands or falls.",
      "\u201cThe significance of this result right now is tantalizing,\u201d said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmouth College who is not involved with the research, \"but it's not like a gold-plated measurement.\"",
      "There\u2019s a lot riding on the answer. Because dark energy is the biggest component of the universe, its behavior determines the universe\u2019s fate, explained David Spergel, an astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation. If dark energy is constant, the universe will continue to expand, forever getting colder and emptier. If it\u2019s growing in strength, the universe will expand so speedily that it\u2019ll destroy itself in what astronomers call the Big Rip.",
      "\u201cNot to panic. If this is what\u2019s going on, it won\u2019t happen for billions of years,\" he said. \u201cBut we'd like to know about it.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 19, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 20, 2024 to correct the location of the telescope used by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. It is southwest of Tucson, Arizona, not in Tucson. It also corrects the description of the instrument's three-dimensional map of the universe.

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and cryptocurrency enthusiast, as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The nomination would put Lutnick in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "Lutnick, a co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led Trump\u2019s Small Business Administration, once appeared on Trump\u2019s NBC reality show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\" He has become a part of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Here are things to know about the billionaire who, if confirmed by the Senate, will lead the Commerce Department.",
      "Elon Musk and others in Trump\u2019s orbit called on Trump last week to dump previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in a post that \u201cBessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\u201d",
      "The treasury role has been at the center of an unusual high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely. Trump has yet to decide on one of the top remaining vacancies in his proposed cabinet.",
      "The major remaining nominees for the role are Bessent, former Federal Reserve board governor Kevin Warsh, Apollo Global Management Chief Executive Marc Rowan, and Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, Trump's former Japan ambassador.",
      "Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. On the campaign trail, Trump portrayed the taxes on imports as both a negotiating tool to hammer out better trade terms and as a way to generate revenue to fund tax cuts elsewhere.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick gave full-throated support for Trump's tariffs plan in a CNBC interview in September. \u201cTariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker,\" he said.",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "Lutnick's brother, Gary Lutnick, and 658 of 960 Cantor Fitzgerald employees were killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees that day. Lutnick is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the Partnership for New York City.",
      "After Cantor Fitzgerald settled a wrongful death and personal injuries case against American Airlines and insurance carriers in 2013 for $135 million, Lutnick said: \u201cWe could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.\u201d",
      "Trump's Tuesday announcement on the Commerce Department nomination mentioned Lutnick's loss \u2014 stating he was \u201cthe embodiment of resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy.\u201d",
      "Lutnick is a proponent of advancing aims of the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 namely, the cryptocurrency Tether.",
      "Cryptocurrencies are forms of digital money that can be traded over the internet without relying on the global banking system. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is like gold and should be free trade everywhere in the world,\u201d Lutnick said at a bitcoin conference earlier this year. \u201cAnd as the largest wholesaler in the world we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to make it so.

      "Michelle Rowland plans to introduce into Parliament on Thursday world-first legislation that would make X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram responsible for excluding Australian children younger than 16 from the platforms.",

      "For two weeks, Donald Trump has welcomed Elon Musk into his world",
      "WASHINGTON -- For two weeks, Donald Trump has welcomed Elon Musk into his world. On Tuesday, it was Musk\u2019s turn to play host to the president-elect.",
      "Trump flew to South Texas to watch as Musk\u2019s SpaceX launched a Starship rocket near the Mexican border. Trump listened intently as the world\u2019s richest man explained how the test would work and demonstrated with a model. And then Trump squinted into the bright sky to watch liftoff.",
      "It didn\u2019t go perfectly -\u2013 the reusable booster did not return to the launch pad as it had done on a previous test last month. Instead, the booster was directed to a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "But Trump\u2019s presence at the launch was a remarkable display of intimacy between the two men, one with implications for American politics, the government, foreign policy and even the possibility of humans reaching Mars.",
      "Musk spent around $200 million to help Trump beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and he's been given unparalleled access. He's counseled Trump on nominees for the new administration, joined the president-elect's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and been tapped to co-chair an advisory panel on cutting the size of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "In addition to political influence, Musk could benefit personally as well. SpaceX, his rocket company, has billions of dollars in government contracts and the goal of eventually starting a colony on Mars. He's also CEO of Tesla, which manufactures electric vehicles, and has battled with regulators over safety concerns involving autonomous driving.",
      "\u201cTrump has the biggest possible regard for people who break the rules and get away with it,\" said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \"Musk has demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment in doing that.\u201d",
      "To top if off, Musk owns the social media company X, formally known as Twitter, which he has harnessed as an influential perch to promote Trump and his agenda.",
      "\u201cStop the Swamp!\u201d he wrote Tuesday as he shared a warning that entrenched Washington interests are trying to undermine Trump before his inauguration.",
      "Before the election, Musk rejected the idea that he was expecting any favors in return for supporting Trump in the presidential race.",
      "\u201cThere is no quid pro quo,\u201d he posted on X in September. \u201cWith a Trump administration, we can execute major government reform, remove bureaucratic paperwork that is smothering the country and unlock a new age of prosperity.\u201d",
      "However, Trump has hardly gone anywhere without Musk in the two weeks since beating Harris. Musk joined Trump at a meeting with House Republicans in Washington and sat next to him at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York. The trip to Texas for the rocket launch was just Trump's third time outside Florida since the election.",
      "As Trump's protective motorcade left the launch site Tuesday evening to return to the airport, one of Musk's angular, shiny Tesla Cybertrucks was tucked in the middle of the formation of black SUVs.",
      "Much of Trump's activity is happening with little public access for the press. Unlike his predecessors, he has opted against regularly making his travel plans or events open to journalists.",
      "The relationship between Trump and Musk was not always so close.",
      "Two years ago, Trump was mocking Musk in stump speeches and Musk was saying it was time for Trump to \u201chang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America,\u201d Musk wrote on social media.",
      "But Musk swiftly endorsed Trump after the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. He quickly became a central figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, appearing at times more like his running mate than Ohio Sen. JD Vance.",
      "Trump started boasting about Musk's accomplishments at campaign rallies, such as when Starship's reusable rocket booster returned to the launch tower on a previous occasion and was caught by mechanical arms.",
      "\u201cThose arms grab it like you grab your baby, just like you grab your little baby. And it hugged it and just put it down, and there it was,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Musk was with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on election night and has spent much of the two weeks since there. Trump\u2019s granddaughter Kai Trump posted a photo of her with Musk at one of Trump\u2019s golf resorts, writing that Musk was \"achieving uncle status.\u201d",
      "Last week, Musk appeared in a golden ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, seated in the center of the room as a guest of honor at an event. Trump, in his remarks at the black tie event, said Musk\u2019s IQ is \u201cabout as high as they can get\u201d and praised him as \u201ca really good guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe launched a rocket three weeks ago and then he went to Pennsylvania to campaign because he considered this more important than launching rockets that cost billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He joked about Musk\u2019s constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, saying: \u201cHe likes this place. I can\u2019t get him out of here.\"",
      "He added, \u201cAnd you know what, I like having him here.\u201d",
      "Musk said of the election results, \u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear.\"",

      "What that actually means for the future of AI technology remains to be seen. Among those who could use some clarity are the government scientists and AI experts from multiple countries gathering in San Francisco this week to deliberate on AI safety measures.",
      "Hosted by the Biden administration, officials from a number of U.S. allies \u2014 among them Australia, Canada, Japan, Kenya, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the 27-nation European Union \u2014 began meeting Wednesday in the California city that's a commercial hub for AI development.",

      "Biden signed a sweeping AI executive order last year and this year formed the new AI Safety Institute at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, which is part of the Commerce Department.",
      "Trump promised in his presidential campaign platform to \u201crepeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.\u201d",
      "But he hasn't made clear what about the order he dislikes or what he'd do about the AI Safety Institute. Trump's transition team didn't respond to emails this week seeking comment.",
      "Tech industry groups \u2014 backed by companies including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft \u2014 are mostly pleased with the AI safety approach of Biden's Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, which has focused on setting voluntary standards.

      "Some experts expect the kind of technical work happening at an old military officers' club at San Francisco's Presidio National Park this week to proceed regardless of who's in charge.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe that we\u2019ll be doing a 180 when it comes to the work of the AI Safety Institute,\u201d said Heather West, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Behind the rhetoric, she said there's already been overlap.",
      "Trump didn\u2019t spend much time talking about AI during his four years as president, though in 2019 he became the first to sign an executive order about AI. It directed federal agencies to prioritize research and development in the field.",
      "Before that, tech experts were pushing the Trump-era White House for a stronger AI strategy to match what other countries were pursuing. Trump in the waning weeks of his administration signed an executive order promoting the use of \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI in the federal government. Those policies carried over into the Biden administration.",
      "All of that was before the 2022 debut of ChatGPT, which brought public fascination and worry about the possibilities of generative AI and helped spark a boom in AI-affiliated businesses. What's also different this time is that tech mogul and Trump adviser Elon Musk has been picked to lead a government cost-cutting commission. Musk holds strong opinions about AI's risks and grudges against some AI industry leaders, particularly ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which he has sued.",

      "Eagle lovers around the world who were crushed when the nest of a Minnesota pair and their chick collapsed on live video last year will get a when a new eagle camera goes live this week",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Eagle lovers around the world who were crushed by the live-streamed collapse of a nest housing two birds and their chick will get another viewing opportunity when a new eagle camera goes live on Thursday.",
      "The new camera, operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, is in a different location and will show a different nesting pair, the agency announced Tuesday. But the DNR will also keep its old EagleCam running because the old pair built a new nest about a half-mile away and still visit their old territory. They've been seen there as recently as Friday.",
      "The old camera had viewers in 50 states and around 160 countries, in homes, classrooms and nursing homes, according to Lori Naumann, a spokesperson for the DNR's Nongame Wildlife Program, which runs the cameras. The old nest was home to a pair that viewers unofficially nicknamed \u201cNancy and Beau\u201d until it collapsed during a heavy snowstorm on April 2, 2023. The female bird flew off as a branch supporting the 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) nest, which was over 20 years old, gave way. The chick was later found dead.",
      "There was an outpouring of grief in popular Facebook groups that followed the pair, and members of those groups expressed excitement at the news Tuesday.",
      "Naumann told reporters they often had thousands of viewers at any given time before the nest collapse, especially during the pandemic as homebound viewers went online to get their nature fixes. Minnesota has the largest eagle population in the lower 48 states, building nests even in urban areas.",
      "The pair at the new, undisclosed location has nested there for at least four years and has reared several broods of eaglets, Naumann said. Officials aren't sure exactly how long the nest has been there or how many chicks the parents have hatched because they haven't followed them closely yet, she said.",
      "Both cameras will go live around 6 a.m. CST Thursday on the DNR website and on the agency\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "There isn't a lot of activity at the nest at the moment, though that will change, Naumann said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really breeding season right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect them to start bringing new branches and new nesting material into the nest over the next several months, when their courtship behavior will start ramping up. And when that happens, they actively build the nest together, showing their dedication to each other and their worthiness of being a partner.\u201d",
      "The female is expected to lay two or three eggs sometime around February, she said, and they'll take about 35 days to hatch. Both adults typically care for their chicks, constantly bringing them dead fish to satisfy their enormous appetites.",
      "As for \u201cNancy and Beau\u201d \u2014 the DNR doesn't name the animals it follows \u2014 it wasn\u2019t feasible to run power to and install a camera at their new nest, where they successfully raised two chicks last season. So the agency launched an extensive search before settling on the new, more accessible location with a healthy tree. They installed the camera in early October at a total cost of about $5,000. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy provided the bucket lift truck and other services to set up the new camera at no charge, as it did with the original.",
      "The eagles serve as ambassadors for the Nongame Wildlife Program, which is supported by direct donations and a voluntary checkoff on the state\u2019s personal income tax form. It funds a range of wildlife projects across the state to benefit struggling species. The cameras are going live on Thursday to leverage a statewide charity event, although as a government agency the DNR isn't an official participant."

      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

      "Authorities say only six monkeys are still on the loose after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Six monkeys were still on the loose early Monday after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research, according to authorities.",
      "Two more Rhesus macaques were trapped Sunday outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, bringing the total of recovered monkeys to 37 of the 43 that escaped, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post.",
      "Both monkeys recaptured Sunday were examined and were in \u201cexcellent condition,\u201d said Westergaard, who was present when they were recovered.",
      "\u201cI can attest with absolute certainty that their spirits were high and they showed all the outward signs of being happy well-adjusted monkeys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very pleased that the animals recovered thus far are in such good condition, and that they show no ill effects from their outdoor adventure.\u201d",
      "All the monkeys taken back to the compound have been fed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and monkey biscuits, which are a high protein Purina Monkey Chow that is specially formulated for the rhesus macaques, Westergaard said.",
      "Two other monkeys were spotted near the traps Sunday afternoon and Alpha Genesis planned to begin trapping efforts before dawn Monday and continue through the day.",
      "Forty-three monkeys made a break for it Nov. 6 after an employee at what locals call \u201cthe monkey farm\u201d did not fully lock their enclosure, police said.",
      "There are three gates keeping the monkeys inside their containment area and a worker is supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure allowing the primates to escape, Westergaard told WCSC-TV last week.",
      "Westergaard said it appears the worker made a mistake and did not intentionally leave the gates where the monkeys could escape.",
      "\u201cMy understanding is that immediately after the incident occurred, the employee\u2019s supervisor approached her and stated that she could be terminated if it was determined that there was no structural failure which led to the escape,\u201d Westergaard told the TV station. \u201cI am told at that point the employee walked off the job and has not returned.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis has said efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "On Monday, a group called Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent another letter to federal officials asking for fines and further inspection of Alpha Genesis for animal mistreatment.",
      "The letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture said a monkey was found dead with its head stuck in a fence and a second strangled in gauze used to secure water bottles. The letter also details several earlier escapes, including one where a monkey had its arm ripped off and another had its arm broken by a tranquilizer dart.",
      "The incidents involved about 30 monkeys and happened in 2022 or earlier. The letter includes emails and other documents from Alpha Genesis given to the group by someone inside the company, wrote Michael Budkie, the group's executive director.",
      "\u201cThis is not animal care, this is neglect and abuse. Though these violations may be back a couple of years ... there is no reason to assume that such a broad set of violations will be totally remedied,\u201d Budkie wrote.",
      "Alpha Genesis did not return a phone call or email asking about the letter.",
      "The USDA has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020. The facility\u2019s most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues and veterinarians found minor problems in only one of the facility\u2019s past six inspections.",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has named the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband.",
      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",
      "The five-person commission has a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump gets to appoint a new member.",
      "Carr has made appearances on Fox News Channel, including when he slammed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 appearance on \u201c Saturday Night Live\u201d the weekend before the election -- charging that the network didn\u2019t offer equal time to Trump.",
      "Also a prolific writer of op-eds, Carr wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month decrying an FCC decision to revoke a federal award for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite service, Starlink. He said the move couldn\u2019t be explained \"by any objective application of the facts, the law or sound policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left\u2019s top targets: Mr. Musk,\u201d Carr wrote."

    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

The defendant's brother, Diego Ibarra, also identified him as the person in the video while being questioned by police a day after the murder.",

      "\"That is what we call consciousness of guilt in our business -- he threw away those items because he knew he had killed her, and he threw them away because he didn't want anyone to find him,\" Ross said.",
      "Her DNA was also found on an Adidas cap he was seen wearing in the video, the expert said. That cap was not discarded, Ross surmised, because Jose Ibarra could not see that there was actually blood on it.",
      "Hours after the killing, Jose Ibarra was also captured wearing different clothes from the dumpster Ring footage while discarding unidentifiable items in a bag in another dumpster at his apartment complex, Ross said. That bag was never recovered by police, she said. Ross surmised that the bag contained the clothes he was wearing earlier that day, which were also similar to ones he was wearing in a selfie posted on Snapchat earlier that morning.",
      "\"His digital evidence of posting selfies of himself wearing what is basically his rapist gear an hour before he leaves his house -- that condemns him, he has condemned himself,\" Ross said.",
      "Defense presents alternative theory",
      "The defense called three witnesses, including a neighbor who said Diego Ibarra had threatened her the night of Riley's murder.",
      "The defense said they had planned to call two additional witnesses -- including Diego Ibarra, who is in federal custody awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to possessing a fraudulent green card, however, his attorney did not wish for him to testify.",
      "\"While the evidence in this case is voluminous, it is circumstantial,\" defense attorney Kaitlyn Beck told the judge.",
      "Beck told the judge they advised Jose Ibarra to have a bench trial \"trusting that your honor could and believing that your honor would set aside the emotions in this case and simply consider the evidence.\"",
      "She argued there is doubt about what was tested and said the judge should be \"skeptical\" of the DNA evidence.",
      "She presented an \"alternative theory\" that Diego Ibarra was actually Riley's murderer, and that Jose Ibarra was an accomplice in covering up the evidence.",
      "\"Maybe it was him throwing away the jacket, as Diego said, maybe he was covering up for his brother,\" Beck said.",
      "\"Under that theory, of course, Jose would be guilty of tampering, but that theory does not prove that he was present or involved in the murder of Laken Riley,\" she said.",
      "She said since three gloves were discarded, it \"suggests that there are multiple pairs of hands wearing those gloves.\"",
      "On rebuttal, Ross called the defense's theory \"desperate\" and a \"mischaracterization of the evidence.\"",
      "\"There is no reasonable explanation for all of this evidence other than he is guilty of every single count in this indictment,\" Ross said of Jose Ibarra.",
      "Diego Ibarra told officers during questioning that he was asleep at the time the killing occurred. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent who was on the case testified earlier Wednesday that there was no evidence to contradict that statement.",
      "Jose Ibarra, a migrant from Venezuela who officials said illegally entered the U.S. in 2022, waived his right to testify during the trial. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges, including malice murder and three counts of felony murder.",
      "Additional charges in the 10-count indictment included aggravated battery, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape, obstructing or hindering a person making an emergency telephone call and tampering with evidence. The latter charge was that he \"knowingly concealed\" evidence -- the jacket and gloves -- in the murder.",
      "Jose Ibarra was also convicted of a peeping tom offense. Prosecutors said that in the hours before Riley's murder, he spied through the window of a UGA graduate student, and said the incident \"shows his state of mind\" that day.",
      "The student testified that she called police after hearing someone trying to open her door.",
      "Ross said the person at the student's apartment was wearing clothes similar to the ones Jose Ibarra had on in the Snapchat selfie posted earlier that morning, including the Adidas cap.",
      "Trump released a statement following the verdict in the high-profile trial, saying that \"our hearts will always be with\" Riley. He also said it's \"time to secure our border, and remove these criminals and thugs from our Country, so nothing like this can happen again!\""

      "On Nov. 3, 1994, police confronted Susan Smith about her story, and she admitted to the killings.",
      "The board mentioned how her case took resources away from the law enforcement community who searched for her sons. Asked what she would say to the responders, Smith said, \"I'm sorry that I put them through that.\"",
      "\"I wish I could take that back, I really do,\" Smith, now 53, said. \"I didn't lie to get away with it. ... I was just scared. I didn't know how to tell the people that love them that they'd never see them again.\"",

      "\"Susan made a horrible, horrible choice to choose a man over her family,\" Pope said. \"If she could have put David in the car, he would've been there, too.\"",
      "\"For the crime she committed ... that punishment has not been achieved yet,\" Pope said.",
      "At the trial, prosecutors argued the young mom was having an affair and said her boyfriend broke off the relationship because of her children.",
      "Susan Smith's defense said she planned to die by suicide with her children, but left the car at the last second.",
      "Pope noted Wednesday that \"she wasn't wet, she wasn't injured\" when she ran for help.",
      "The defense also focused on her mental health and her childhood; Susan Smith's stepfather testified that he sexually abused her for years.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 06:38:34 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's second term could bring reform to energy permitting and increased fracking on federal lands.",
    "story": [
      "Fracking accounts for the bulk of America's domestic oil and gas production.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 campaign was, in part, built on a bedrock of U.S. domestic oil and gas production.",
      "Throughout the election cycle, Trump repeated his \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan, promising a fracking boom that he said could help make America more \"energy independent\" and lower voters' spending at the gas station.",
      "During his campaign speech at Madison Square Garden in October, Trump asserted his oil and gas policy would \"cut your energy prices in half,\" telling voters that within a year of his inauguration in January 2025, they'd see a 50% decrease in costs.",
      "Time will tell what the Trump administration will accomplish, but experts say that within his first few months in office, Trump could dramatically tap into America's drilling landscape.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the Trump campaign for a comment.",
      "\"There's a number of things that he can do within the first 90 days when he gets in office to really help bolster American energy,\" Tim Tarpley, president of the Energy Workforce & Technology Council, told ABC News.",
      "Tarpley oversees the national trade association that represents 220 energy service and technology companies and over 650,000 individuals in the U.S. energy workforce.",
      "Increase fracking on federal land",
      "Trump nominating fracking services executive Chris Wright to spearhead the Department of Energy signals an increase in domestic drilling during his term.",
      "Wright founded the publicly traded oilfield services firm Liberty Energy in 2010, which fracks 20% of the onshore wells nationally.",
      "The $3 billion company is involved in nearly 10% of the United States' total energy production, according to Wright.",
      "\"Chris has been a leading technologist and entrepreneur in Energy. He has worked in Nuclear, Solar, Geothermal, and Oil and Gas,\" Trump wrote in a statement announcing Wright as the nominee.",
      "\"Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence, and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics,\" Trump added.",
      "During an interview with Bloomberg in July, Wright suggested that the Trump administration would expand drilling on federal lands and make it easier to permit infrastructure.",
      "Fracking accounts for the bulk of America's domestic oil and gas production, with 95% of new wells being hydraulically fractured, creating two-thirds of the total U.S. gas market and about half of U.S. crude oil production, according to the\u00a0U.S. Energy Department.",
      "Despite the back-and-forth between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on a so-called fracking ban during the election cycle, fracking wells in the U.S. are predominantly on private land, with federal land leases only accounting for 24% of the total number of wells, according to the American Petroleum Institute.",
      "Trump's second term in the White House could see a shift in that percentage, with more permits being leased to federal land, Tarpley said, while noting that substantial changes \"will not happen overnight.\"",
      "\"Those numbers may increase, that perpetual share may increase slightly, but I don't think there's going to be a dramatic increase in fracking on federal lands in the near term,\" he said.",
      "Reform permitting processes",
      "At the top of the to-do list, Tarpley said Trump will likely pass a bipartisan permitting reform bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairmen Joe Manchin and John Barrasso in July.",
      "Notably, independent Sen. Manchin and Republican Sen. Barrasso represent major energy-producing states, West Virginia and Wyoming.",
      "The Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 aims to \"strengthen U.S. energy independence by accelerating the permitting process for critical energy and mineral projects,\" according to the bill.",
      "The legislation slashes the amount of time allotted to energy projects to undergo judicial review. Specifically, it recommends reducing the deadline for filing lawsuits against an agency that has approved or denied a permit from six years to just 150 days.",
      "The bill also requires courts to prioritize cases reviewing an agency permitting decision for oil and gas projects -- essentially moving oil and gas cases up the docket.",
      "Tarpley believes the passing of this legislation, which will likely be possible with the GOP-controlled Senate, will make America more competitive in the global energy market.",
      "\"Currently, it takes about five years to get a permit for a gas pipeline from initial design to construction to done,\" Tarpley said. \"That's well longer than most of our peers around the world.\"",
      "Environmental and health effects",
      "Environmental organizations have decried the Energy Permitting Reform Act. In July, more than 360 environmental organizations shared a joint letter to the Senate committee urging them to reject what they called a \"dirty permitting deal.\"",
      "The organizations, led by the nonprofit Earth Justice, called the legislation, \"an egregious attempt to fulfill the wish list of the fossil fuel industry, which is laid out in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, under the guise of promoting renewable energy and developing transmission infrastructure.\"",
      "Organizations fear that the bill and its proposed limitations on the judicial review process will lead to more leasing and drilling without federal oversight and community input.",
      "The National Institutes of Health warns of the impacts of increased fracking, saying chemicals used in the process could lead to air and water contamination, harming human health and the environment.",
      "A 2022 study published in the National Library of Medicine found that air pollutants from fracking sites is associated with multiple cancers and increased health risk.",
      "\"The researchers found that older adults who lived near or downwind of unconventional oil and gas development sites had a higher risk of premature death than those living upwind,\" the NIH reported.",
      "Similarly, the Environmental Protection Agency found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracking activities can affect drinking water resources under some circumstances, but the extent of contamination is unknown.",
      "Still, Trump's vocal support for domestic oil production is something he said could be on the \"Day 1\" agenda.",
      "During a campaign stop in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in October,\u00a0Trump said, \"On Day 1, frack, frack, frack, and drill, drill, drill.\"",
      "\"We will have energy independence and energy dominance,\" he added.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Thomas Homan, Trump's choice to serve as the border czar, said U.S. military assets would be a \"force multiplier\" in the deportations.",
    "story": [
      "The border czar said troops would be a \"force multiplier\" in deportations.",
      "The Trump administration's plan to use active-duty U.S. military personnel to help with the mass deportation of undocumented migrants appears to be similar to the support role that troops provided along the U.S-Mexico border in 2018 and 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "During his 2024 campaign, President-elect Donald Trump often referenced military personnel forming a part of his plans to assist the deportation, but how they would do that under existing legal authorities was left vague. On Monday, however, Trump confirmed that he planned to declare a national emergency to carry out that campaign promise.",
      "Additionally, Thomas Homan, Trump's choice to serve as the Border Czar, fleshed out his view of how U.S. military assets would be a \"force multiplier\" in the deportations but stressed that they would be carrying out \"non-enforcement duties.\" In other words, military personnel will not be participating in arrests.",
      "\"They'll be used to do non-enforcement duties such as transportation, whether it's on ground or air, infrastructure, building, intelligence,\" Homan said in an interview on Fox Business Network.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers doing those duties could be replaced by military personnel \"because it doesn't require immigration authority,\" Homan explained.",
      "He also described the military's role as a \"force multiplier to take more agents, put them on streets where we need them\" and he envisioned the U.S. military possibly assisting in flights taking detainees back to their home countries.",
      "\"We're hoping DOD will help us with air flights, because there's a limited number of planes ICE has contracts with; so DOD can certainly help with air flights all across the globe,\" he said.",
      "Homan's description was very similar to the previous active-duty deployment in 2018 and 2019 ,during Trump's first term that supported U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as migrant caravans from Central America made their way to the U.S. border.",
      "The mission was ordered in October 2018 and eventually saw the deployment of 6,100 active duty forces to the border, which was soon followed by Trump's declaration of a national emergency that enabled the U.S. military to help build portions of the border wall.",
      "Pentagon officials stressed that the thousands of active-duty troops deployed to the border would only be serving in a support role to federal law enforcement and that they would not carry out law enforcement duties. That role was in line with the Posse Comitatus Act that forbids the U.S. military from carrying out law enforcement duties domestically.",
      "The active-duty troops joined 2,350 National Guardsmen who were already helping CBP in their home states of California, Texas, and Arizona.",
      "Initially, the mission of the active-duty troops was to build housing for additional CBP personnel headed to the region, provide medical support, fly CBP personnel around the border region and construct 70 miles of additional obstacles and security barriers for the 22 ports of entry. Military police units were deployed to provide security for military construction crews working along the border and were the only forces that were allowed to be armed during the deployment.",
      "What was supposed to be a 45-day mission kept being extended and continues to this day in a modified way and in much smaller numbers than 2019.",
      "After the initial mission goals were quickly completed, the Pentagon approved a new Department of Homeland Security request to set up an unarmed quick reaction force to help CPB with riot control in case there was a migrant rush at a port of entry.",
      "In April 2019, the role of active-duty troops was expanded so they could be allowed to assist in driving high-capacity CBP vehicles to transport migrants; provide administrative support, including providing heating, meal distribution and monitoring the welfare of individuals in CBP custody; and attorney support to ICE.",
      "A month later, the Pentagon approved a DHS request to provide tent housing for up to 7,500 single adult migrants at six locations along the border. The tents were to come from U.S. military supplies and were to be erected by U.S. military personnel. . Eventually, DHS requested that active duty personnel set up an additional 150 miles of concertina wire along the border area beyond the 70 miles of obstacles that were laid out in the first six weeks of the border support mission.",
      "Trump's conformation that he plans to declare a national emergency to enable the mass deportation is a different rationale than the national emergency that he declared in 2019.",
      "The 6,100 active-duty troops were deployed to the border under existing authorities. Instead, the national emergency that Trump declared in early 2019 was to make it possible for the U.S military to help construct portions of the border wall that had been one of his major campaign promises.",
      "The National Emergencies Act allows the military to undertake new military construction projects not specified by Congress, but only if previously appropriated funds for such projects are used.",
      "In the end, the Pentagon was able to use $6.1 billion in funding for the wall including $3.6 billion in funds reallocated from other projects and an additional $2.5 billion in funding from counter narcotics efforts.",
      "Declaring a national emergency is not a rare occurrence and the National Emergencies Act has been invoked multiple times. At the time of the border declaration, there were about 30 emergencies already in effect by previous administrations.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, one of his first orders of business will be to decide about the fate of TikTok in the United States -- and some of his cabinet appointees appear to be split on the issue.",
      "Sources familiar with the president-elect's thinking told ABC News that he may try to stop the ban of the popular social media app, which according to a new law must either find a new U.S. owner by Jan. 19 or face a ban.",
      "Trump's pick to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, signaled support for banning TikTok in 2022.",
      "\"I think either a total ban or some sort of action like that that's going to completely sever the corporate links back into Beijing,\" Carr told NPR, referencing concerns about possible data usage on the Chinese-owned app.",
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz -- Trump's controversial pick to for attorney general, who would lead the department that would enforce any ban -- voted against a ban of the app while he was a member of the House -- though he signaled some support for the initiative.",
      "\"Banning TikTok is the right idea. But this legislation was overly broad, rushed and unavailable for amendment or revision. This is no way to run a railroad (or the internet),\" Gaetz wrote on X, formerly Twitter, at the time.",
      "TikTok and its parents company, ByteDance, have sued the U.S. government over the potential ban, ABC News previously reported, saying it's unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment, while pushing back on claims about the app being security risk.",
      "\"Congress itself has offered nothing to suggest that the TikTok platform poses the types of risks to data security or the spread of foreign propaganda that could conceivably justify the act,\" TikTok's lawsuit said.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, Trump could try to stop the ban through a number of methods, including pushing Congress to repeal the law banning the app, refusing to enforce the ban, or helping TikTok find a U.S. buyer to comply with the law and render the issue moot.",
      "The ban of the app was spearheaded in Congress by former Rep. Mike Gallagher, who said in an April interview with the New York Times that TikTok posed an \"espionage threat\" and a \"propaganda threat\" and that China is \"America's foremost adversary.\"",
      "Responding to allegations regarding TikTok, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Nig last year said that China \"has never and will not\" direct companies to illegally collect data in other countries, according to The New York Times.",
      "In testimony before Congress, TikTok's CEO also said the app was \"free from any manipulation from any government\" and that he had \"seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to that data. They have never asked us, we have not provided it,\" according to NPR.",
      "Gallagher resigned early this year and took a job with software company Palantir Technologies. A spokesperson for Gallagher rebuffed questions raised at the time over his swift move to Palantir, a company that was vocal about its opposition to TikTok, according to Forbes magazine.",

      "After Trump announced Gaetz as his attorney general pick, the Florida congressman resigned from the House, meaning the House Ethics Committee no longer has the jurisdiction to continue its investigation into him -- however Republicans and Democrats have argued whether a break in that precedent is necessary for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty to advise and consent to presidential nominations.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, Marsha Blackburn, John Kennedy and John Cornyn met with Vance and Gaetz Wednesday.",
      "Graham told reporters that the meeting went well and that Gaetz deserves a fair nomination process.",
      "\"Here's what I told him, no rubber stamps and no lynch mob. I'm not going to be part of a process that leaks information that shouldn't be leaked,\" Graham said. \"I'm not going to legitimize the process to destroy the man because people don't like his politics. He will be held to account in the confirmation process. He deserves a chance to make his argument why he should be attorney general.\"",
      "Hawley defended Gaetz's nomination.",
      "\"My intention is to vote for all the president's nominees,\" Hawley said. \"I think for my colleagues who are -- who have concerns about the Attorney General nominee, my message would be, well, let's have a hearing on this. You can ask whatever -- if you're a member of the committee, you can ask whatever question you want, give Gaetz the opportunity to answer questions, lay out his vision, answer concerns.\"",
      "Hawley said Gaetz understands his job, if confirmed, is to \"serve at the pleasure of the president.\"",
      "\"You gotta remember that cabinet secretary is not an exercise in individuality. I mean, you're there to serve at the pleasure of the president. That's the job, and he has a sense of what the president wants to do in terms of prioritizing law enforcement, getting the department out of the business of political prosecutions. So he wants a chance to lay that out,\" Hawley said.",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday to request the complete evidentiary file in the bureau's closed investigation into Gaetz. Included in the ask is a request for forms that memorialize interviews conducted as part of the investigation.",
      "The Democrats argued in the letter that there is precedent for the FBI providing these sorts of documents to Congress, including instances when Republicans obtained these documents.",
      "As Vance and Gaetz met with senators, Trump attempted to blame Democrats for the allegations launched against some of his controversial Cabinet picks.",
      "\"They dirty them up, they destroy them, and then they spit them out. They are trying that right now with some great American Patriots who are only trying to fix the mess that the Democrats have made of our Country,\" Trump posted on his social media platform Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The fate of the Gaetz report is in the hands of the committee, and Rep. Susan Wild, ranking member on the House Ethics Committee, said the committee will vote on whether to release the report on Wednesday.",
      "If there is a vote, a majority of the five Democrats and five Republicans on the committee must approve its public disclosure -- meaning at least one Republican must break party ranks to join Democrats to force its release.",

      "House investigators also obtained a $750 check from Gaetz, said sources.",
      "The House Ethics Committee obtained records, including a check and records of Venmo payments, that appear to show that then-Rep. Matt Gaetz paid more than $10,000 to two women who were later witnesses in sexual misconduct probes conducted by both the House and the Justice Department, according to documents obtained by ABC News.",
      "The Venmo records show that between July 2017 and late January 2019, Gaetz -- who was first elected in 2016 -- allegedly made 27 Venmo payments totaling $10,224.02 to the two witnesses, who were over the age of 18 at the time.",
      "The payments, which sources said were displayed during closed-door testimony, ranged from $100 to more than $700 each.",
      "ABC News previously reported that House investigators had subpoenaed Venmo for Gaetz's records and had been showing them to witnesses, asking if they were for sex or drugs. The Venmo records totaling over $10,000 in payments were shown to the witnesses, who testified that some of the payments were from Gaetz and were for sex, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News.",
      "Gaetz, who was tapped last Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, resigned from the House immediately following Trump's announcement, just days before the House Ethics Committee was to set to consider releasing a report on its investigation into the Florida congressman, according to sources.",

      "\"These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration,\" Pfeiffer said this week of the allegations involving Gaetz, which the Justice Department began investigating during the first Trump administration.",
      "Descriptions in the \"Notes\" section for some of the alleged Venmo payments from Gaetz included labels such as \"Gift,\" \"Car deductible,\" \"Cartrages,\" and \"Refreshments.\" Other entries referenced \"travel,\" and one listed a payment for a flight and the phrase \"extra 4 u.\"",
      "That alleged flight payment appears to align with a September 2018 trip to the Bahamas, which ABC News previously reported was part of the Justice Department's investigation into Gaetz.",
      "In other payments, emojis like a wrapped gift or the hug emoji are used, the records show.",
      "The payment records also show that in early January 2019, both witnesses received mirroring payments labeled for \"travel\" around the time Gaetz allegedly arranged for two women to fly to New York for sex and to accompany him to an appearance on the Fox News show \"Outnumbered,\" as ABC News previously reported.",
      "The Ethics Committee also obtained a signed check made out to cash and dated October 2018, allegedly from Gaetz for $750, with the memo reading \"tuition reimbursement.\" A witness testified to the committee that Gaetz gave her the check, according to a source familiar with the matter. Gaetz's name is printed at the top left of the check along with an address.",
      "Gaetz previously dismissed allegations that he paid for sex, saying that \"someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee is expected to meet on Wednesday and discuss whether to vote to release its report on Gaetz, despite the fact that its investigation ended when Gaetz resigned from the House, multiple sources told ABC News.",

I played a lot of sports growing up, and like a lot of other athletes, I really enjoyed the challenge of using my hands. I just loved the idea of being in a field where you could [do that].\"",

      "What would Oz run as CMS administrator?",
      "CMS administers the Medicare program, the federal health insurance program for those mostly aged 65 and older.",

In later episodes of his TV show, Oz would go on to endorse the measles, mumps, rubella shot.",
      "Oz also came under fire due to his claims about certain \"miracle\" products to help consumers lose weight.",
      "During a 2014 hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on consumer protection, then-Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri grilled Oz, claiming he had a role in \"perpetuating\" scams.",
      "\"When you feature a product on your show, it creates what has become known as the 'Oz effect,' dramatically boosting sales and driving scam artists to pop up overnight using false and deceptive ads to sell questionable products,\" she said. \"While I understand that your message is also focused on basics like healthy eating and exercise, I'm concerned that you are melding medical advice news and entertainment in a way that harms consumers.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz defended his statements, saying he believed in the benefits of the products he promoted on his show.",
      "\"I actually do personally believe in the items I talk about in the show. I passionately study them. I recognize that often times they don't have the scientific muster to present as fact. But, nevertheless, I give my audience the advice I give my family all the time. I give my family these products, specifically the ones you mentioned. I'm comfortable with that part,\" he said.",

      "Trump's top education priorities in his Agenda47 policy platform include restoring and empowering parental rights and parental control.",
      "Conservatives, led by political figures like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and groups like Moms for Liberty, have embraced the mantle of parental rights and claimed -- in part because of the window that remote schooling opened into the classroom -- that public school instruction has been hijacked by inappropriate curricula on LGBTQ+ topics, race and discrimination and more.",
      "McMahon, 76, led the SBA from 2017-2019 during Trump's first administration. The Trump loyalist is the first cabinet secretary from his previous administration to be picked for a role in the upcoming administration.",
      "McMahon is also the wife of former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO Vince McMahon. The two co-founded WWE together in 1980.",
      "McMahon, a major GOP donor who has given tens of millions of dollars in support of pro-Trump causes, is chair of the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) board. She also served two years on the Connecticut Board of Education.",
      "Trump choosing a confidante for this position and others creates unhelpful groupthink that could potentially lead to bad decision-making for U.S. students, Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president of the advocacy group The Education Trust, told ABC News.",
      "\"The danger in appointing loyalists is that you have a group of folks who all think the same, and they all think the way that the President-elect thinks,\" Del Pilar said. \"By appointing someone who will offer no resistance, it gets him [Trump] closer to his ultimate goal, which is to eliminate the Department of Education.\"",
      "Trump can't abolish the Department of Education on day one without congressional action, but his Agenda47 education platform makes clear he wants to do so \"very early in the administration.\"",
      "\"We're going to close it up,\" the president-elect said in a Agenda47 video message released last year, adding, \"All those buildings, all over the place, and you have people that, in many cases, hate our children. We're going to send it all back to the States.\"",
      "While possible in theory, education policy experts who spoke with ABC News suggest that would be an extremely chaotic \u2013 and unrealistic \u2014 task on Inauguration Day.",
      "\"The Department of Education was created through legislation,\" Cato Institute Education analyst Neal McCluskey told ABC News. \"Legislation comes through Congress. If you want to take the Department of Education apart, you have to do that through legislation,\" McCluskey added.",
      "Education experts suggest closing up the department could gut public education funding and disproportionately impact high-need students across the country.",
      "House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx argued that it's not a constitutional requirement to have such a department. She called McMahon a \"fighter\" who will work tirelessly in service of the students.",
      "Meanwhile, National Education Association (NEA) President Becky Pringle blasted the selection.",
      "\"McMahon's (sic) only mission is to eliminate the Department of Education and take away taxpayer dollars from public schools, where 90% of students - and 95% of students with disabilities \u2013 learn, and give them to unaccountable and discriminatory private schools,\" Pringle said in a statement to ABC News. \"The Senate must stand up for our students and reject Donald Trump's unqualified nominee, Linda McMahon. Our students and our nation deserve so much better than Betsy DeVos 2.0.\"",
      "According to education experts, an end to the Department of Education could also leave billions of funds, scholarships, grants and more hanging in the balance for the millions of K-12 and college students attending schools in the U.S.",
      "However, critics of the department argue that federal education spending has ballooned since its founding -- costing $23 billion to date in the 2025 fiscal year, about 4% of government spending so far -- but measures of student success like reading and math scores have fallen in recent years.",

    "summary": "A look at how Trump can upend the federal government, including \"deleting\" agencies and ousting workers he sees as unloyal.",
    "story": [
      "With more Trump-appointed judges in the courts, legal challenges could fail.",
      "President Donald Trump's picks to lead the next administration are talking about abolishing entire agencies and firing tens of thousands of federal workers at a time.",
      "But can his administration actually do all that?",
      "Experts believe Trump can get much further on upending the government system this go-around compared to his first term -- in part because the typical checks and balances are expected to lean in his favor.",
      "Next year, the House and Senate are on track to fall under Republican control. Trump also got 226 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices confirmed while he was in office last time -- giving his ideas a sympathetic ear in the courts when he gets sued.",
      "With that in mind, here's a look at how Trump could try to \"break\" the federal government:",
      "Elon Musk, who Trump has picked to co-lead the new outside-of-government \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" has said he wants to cut $2 trillion of the $7 trillion in annual federal spending. His partner, Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News that they would achieve this through \"mass reductions\" and that some governmental agencies may be \"deleted outright.\"",
      "The idea seems far-fetched at first because federal agencies are established by federal law. The Department of Education, for example, was created by a 1979 passed by Congress signed by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "Congress would need to pass new legislation to erase or significantly reform the Education Department -- an uphill battle even with a Republican-led Congress.",
      "Enter the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. For much of the country's existence, presidents could, in theory, ignore spending money appropriated by Congress.",
      "President Richard Nixon used the tactic of sitting on -- or impounding -- federal money, essentially leaving funds untouched in U.S. Treasury accounts when he thought the spending was wasteful.",
      "Democrats responded in 1974 by passing a law that requires a president to spend federal money the way Congress intended.",
      "In a campaign video posted last year, Trump said he would challenge the Impoundment Control Act. It's possible too that he could deem the law unconstitutional and try to ignore it -- inviting legal challenges that could take years to resolve.",
      "\"For 200 years under our system of government, it was undisputed that the president had the constitutional power to stop unnecessary spending through what is known as impoundment,\" Trump said in a video during the GOP primaries.",
      "He later added: \"When I returned to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court, and, if necessary, get Congress to overturn it.\"",
      "Among the ideas Trump is expected to try again this term is to make the lives of some federal workers uncomfortable or to relocate their jobs to remote locations.",
      "In his first administration, Trump temporarily decimated the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management by relocating its Washington headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado. The idea, officials said at the time, was to put leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage. But the vast majority of the workers quit and the office never was able to find employees to replace them.",
      "Another tactic could be to make it harder for workers to file grievances or strip them of legal protections.",
      "In fall of 2020, during the final months of Trump's first administration, he issued an executive order that would have created a new class of employees handling policy-related duties, essentially stripping them from legal protections that kept them in their jobs.",
      "The idea of Schedule F came too late in Trump's first administration to have a significant impact, but it's one expected to be pushed early on this time.",
      "The tactic is risky to taxpayers in the long term. While lawsuits and complaints by federal workers could take years to resolve, the federal government could owe back pay to workers who can prove they were wrongfully terminated.",
      "\"Taking a hatchet to this stuff will have an impact today and for decades to come,\" said Andrew Huddleston, communications director of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees that opposed Trump's election.",
      "\"It will be the future generations that pay the price,\" he said.",
      "In order to remake the government, Trump will need to install loyal allies across senior levels of the government and find ways to slow down legal challenges.",
      "Among his proposals is to outsource FBI background checks for appointees to private investigators, a tactic that would enable him to hire people close to him even if there are security flags.",
      "Trump also has called for the use of \"recess appointments\" in the Senate, a common move by past presidents. For Trump though, it could enable his allies to ram through nominations without FBI security checks or financial disclosures so long as the chamber is adjourned for 10 days or longer. Sen. John Thune, the GOP's pick as majority leader, said he hasn't ruled out the idea, even though it would mean ceding the Senate's \"advise and consent\" constitutional confirmation power to the president.",
      "Another Trump tactic for forcing change could be developing his biggest plans in secret, making it harder for opponents to object and mount legal challenges.",
      "Ramaswamy said the new 'Department of Government Efficiency', or DOGE, will operate outside of government as a kind of private advisory group. That means its staff won't be required to submit financial disclosures or report conflicts of interest.",
      "It won't be clear who is doing work for DOGE or how decisions are made. And while Musk has said he wants staff to work for free, it's likely industry lobbyists would eagerly sign up if it means being able to influence how future taxpayer money is spent.",
      "Musk, who owns the rocket company SpaceX, has blamed federal regulations slowing his quest to reach Mars and oversees billions in contracts with the federal government, including military satellites. Ramaswamy founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences and remains a stakeholder who also could benefit financially depending upon how future federal regulations are written.",
      "At last week's gala hosted by the America First Policy Institute, Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy make the perfect pair to shake up the government.",
      "\"We're going to reduce regulation, waste, fraud, and inefficiency, and these two guys are going to find a lot of it,\" Trump said.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats are expected to work to confirm Biden's nominees.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for a halt in confirming President Joe Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary until he takes office, accusing Democrats of \"trying to stack the courts.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, urging Republican senators to \"show up and hold the line.\"",
      "\"No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The White House responded to Trump's post, arguing that \"there is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Regardless of party, the American people expect their leaders to fight for the rule of law and to ensure the criminal justice system can function effectively in every state,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. \"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases -- meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason for Republicans and Democrats to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench.\"",
      "Bates said during the lame-duck period of Trump's first term in 2020, the then-GOP-led Senate confirmed 55 nominee, including 18 judges.",
      "The directive from the president-elect comes as Senate Democrats are expected to dedicate hours of floor time in the coming weeks as part of a last-minute effort to confirm as many of Biden's nominees before Trump takes over in January. Senate Republicans thwarted their efforts late Monday night, a plan from their soon-to-be leader Sen. John Thune and a reversal from his previous stance on blocking confirmations of qualified judicial nominees.",
      "Senate Republicans rebelled late Monday night, dragging out the floor process by forcing Democrats to hold time-consuming votes on procedural motions that are usually routine and otherwise mundane. Actions that should have taken minutes on the floor instead took hours.",
      "Thune, who takes over as Republican leader of the Senate in January, took credit for the rebellion, saying in a statement that Republicans would not \"roll over\" to appoint Biden's nominees to the federal bench in the \"final weeks of the Democrat majority.\"",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "Thune's statement vowing to obstruct the judicial confirmation process in the final hours of the Biden presidency is a departure from comments he made just a few years ago toward the end of Trump's administration. At the time, Thune touted the importance of confirming judges to the bench, saying it was \"one of our most important responsibilities as senators\" and one of the main reasons he ran for the Senate.",
      "\"Mr. President, confirming good judges is one of our most important responsibilities as senators. And it's a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Thune said during a floor speech on Nov. 18 2020 -- after Biden won the election.",
      "\"After George W. Bush's election, Democrats decided that the president's judicial nominees might not deliver the results Democrats wanted. And so, they decided to adopt a new strategy -- blocking judicial nominees on a regular basis,\" Thune said during his remarks in 2020. \"I was one of the many Americans upset by the blockade of talented, well-qualified nominees. And it was one of the main reasons I ran for the Senate. I promised South Dakotans that if they elected me, I would help put outstanding judges on the bench.\"",
      "\"In fact, one of the main reasons I was first elected to the Senate was to make sure outstanding judicial nominees were confirmed to the federal bench. It's hard to imagine now, but confirming judges used to be a pretty bipartisan affair,\" Thune said at the time.",
      "His comments from 2020 are a notable reversal from his comments this week, as Senate Republicans look to obstruct Democrats as they attempt to do the same for Biden.",
      "Schumer though, doubled down on his efforts Tuesday, and said he expects the Senate to work late into the night again this Wednesday to get the nominees through. Senate Democrats are hoping to confirm as many judges to lifetime appointments as they can while Biden is still president.",
      "\"Members should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on the nominations I filed last night,\" Schumer warned.",
      "\"Voting on the president's judicial nominees is a core function of the Senate. It's one of our basic responsibilities, and we're going to carry out that responsibility as long as this majority continues. I'm very proud of the judges we've confirmed over the past four years under this administration, they have all been highly qualified individuals, and together, they represent a wide range of experiences and areas of expertise.\"",
      "Schumer touted the quality of judges the Senate has passed under his leadership, noting their many backgrounds and cultures and identities. He said under his watch, the Senate has confirmed a record number of women and people of color to the federal bench.",
      "Republicans have Democrats' record on judicial confirmations beat.",
      "Republicans confirmed 234 of Trump's nominees to the federal courts during his four years in office, and so far the Democrat-controlled Senate has confirmed 216 under Biden's administration.",
      "\"We're not done,\" Schumer said on the floor Tuesday. \"There are more judges to consider and confirm.\"",
      "Schumer vowed to spend the rest of the week -- and the year -- confirming more judges. Every judge confirmed in this lame-duck session of Congress is one fewer vacancy Trump can fill come January.",

    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",
      "The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century.",

      "The agreement between state officials and representatives of five defendants requires the state to \u201cuse its best efforts\u201d to open a new psychiatric hospital by January 2027 in Wichita, the state's largest city. Officials also must seek funding from the Kansas Legislature to reopen a previously closed 30-bed unit at its psychiatric hospital in Larned in western Kansas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.",
      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",

      "The man, whose name has not been released, was tracked to the motel in Jackson Township by the Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force, the U.S. Marshals Service said. When confronted by officers shortly after noon Monday, the man pointed a gun at them and barricaded himself inside a room.",
      "The task force members backed off when they saw the weapon, and the Canton Regional SWAT Team soon responded. The man fired several shots and a North Canton officer who serves on the SWAT team was hit once in the arm. He is expected to fully recover from surgery.",
      "The man, who was alone in the motel room, eventually was shot by officers and was pronounced dead. Two weapons and multiple bullet casings were found in the motel room, authorities said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what led to the federal weapons charge. Marshals did not immediately respond to a request for more details.",
      "No other injuries were reported in the standoff."

    "story": [
      "The Texas State Board of Education has given initial approval to a Bible-infused curriculum that would be optional for public schools to adopt for lessons from kindergarten through fifth grade",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas' education board on Tuesday advanced a new Bible-infused curriculum that would be optional for schools to incorporate in kindergarten through fifth grades, one of the latest Republican-led efforts in the U.S. to incorporate more religious teaching into classrooms.",
      "The vote moves the Texas State Board of Education one step closer to signing off on what is known as the \u201cBluebonnet\u201d textbook, which drew hours of often emotional testimony from school teachers and parents earlier this week.",
      "The board is expected to hold a final vote on the measure Friday.",
      "The curriculum \u2014 designed by the state's public education agency \u2014 would allow teachings from the Bible such as the Golden Rule and lessons from books such as Genesis into classrooms. Under the plan, it would be optional for schools to adopt the curriculum though they would receive additional funding if they did so.",
      "Educators, parents and advocates weighed in Monday at the State Board of Education\u2019s final meeting of the year, where many opponents argued that the proposal\u2019s emphasis on Christian teachings would alienate students of other faith backgrounds. Those in favor testified that it\u2019ll give students a more holistic educational foundation.",
      "Educator Megan Tessler testified Monday that the plan contradicts the public school mission.",
      "\u201cThis curriculum fails to meet the standard of an honest, secular one,\u201d Tessler said. \u201cPublic schools are meant to educate, not indoctrinate.\u201d",
      "Others strongly backed the idea.",
      "\u201cParents and teachers want a return to excellence,\u201d said Cindy Asmussen, testifying Monday. \u201cStories and concepts in the Bible have been common for hundreds of years,\" and that, she said, is a core part of classical learning.",
      "Religious experts and the Texas Freedom Network, a left-leaning watchdog group that monitors the state\u2019s education board, said the curriculum proposal focuses too much on Christianity and also dances around the history of slavery.",
      "The program was designed by the Texas Education Agency earlier this year after passage of a law giving it a mandate to create its own free textbook. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has publicly supported the new materials.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have also proposed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms and are likely to revisit the issue next year.",
      "The proposal to incorporate religious teaching in Texas public schools mirrors similar efforts around the country, which are also drawing court challenges.",
      "In Oklahoma, state officials are seeking to include the Bible in public school lesson plans. But a group of students' parents, teachers and others recently filed suit, seeking to stop Oklahoma's top education official from carrying out the plan intended for students in grades 5 through 12. The lawsuit before the Oklahoma Supreme Court also asks the court to stop the Republican state superintendent from spending $3 million to purchase Bibles in support of the plan.",
      "In Louisiana, a new state law sought to have the Ten Commandments displayed in all public classrooms, but a federal judge recently quashed that requirement. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge said last week that the Louisiana law had an \u201covertly religious\u201d purpose, and rejected state officials\u2019 claims that the government can mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments because they hold historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. His opinion noted that no other foundational documents \u2014 including the Constitution or the Bill of Rights \u2014 must be posted.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court urged Libya and other nations Tuesday to help arrest six men allegedly linked to a brutal militia blamed for multiple killings and other crimes in a strategically important western town where mass graves were discovered in 2020.",
      "Karim Khan told the U.N. Security Council that he is ready to work with the Libyan government and people as well as countries that are parties to the ICC and those that are not to assist in the arrests.",
      "The ICC does not have a police force and relies on cooperation from its 124 member states to enforce arrest warrants.",
      "The six men were either key members of or associated with the Al Kaniyat militia that controlled the town of Tarhuna from at least 2015 to June 2020, when government forces ousted them from the town. Tarhuna is located about 65 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of the capital, Tripoli.",
      "Briefing the council by video from Libya, Khan said he met victims earlier Tuesday from Tarhuna who told him of their suffering. He said he walked \u201cin the areas where their loved ones were tortured and killed.\u201d One Libyan told him that \u201cevery household in Tarhuna has a victim,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThey have a steely determination. They have a clear conviction that justice and accountability and fair processes are essential for themselves, their families, their community, and for Libya at large,\u201d Khan said.",
      "The prosecutor said the victims\u2019 determination \u201cgives rise to renewed hope that things are moving in a direction away from talk to action, and the possibility of justice.\u201d",
      "The ICC unsealed arrest warrants in early October for six men: Abdelrahim al-Kani, Makhlouf Douma, Nasser al-Lahsa, Mohammed Salheen, Abdelbari al-Shaqaqi and Fathi al-Zinkal.",
      "Khan said at that time that three of the men were leaders or senior members of Al Kaniyat. Three others were Libyan security officials associated with the militia at the time of the alleged crimes.",
      "\u201cWe know where they are,\u201d Khan said Tuesday.",
      "The ICC prosecutor said the victims told him they are pleased with the warrants but \u201cwhat they are demanding is your help to help with the arrests of those individuals and to ensure that there are trials \u2014 that they can be part of trials when they can give evidence.\u201d",
      "Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments.",
      "The mass graves were found in Tarhuna after the militia\u2019s withdrawal following the collapse of a 14-month campaign by military commander Khalifa Hifter, who is still a powerful force in the east, to wrest control of Tripoli from an array of militias allied with the former U.N.-recognized government."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 07:22:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The Los Angeles City Council has voted to enact an ordinance to prohibit city resources from being used for immigration enforcement in anticipation of potential mass deportations under President-elect Donald Trump",
    "story": [
      "The Los Angeles City Council has voted to enact an ordinance to prohibit city resources from being used for immigration enforcement in anticipation of potential mass deportations under President-elect Donald Trump",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a so-called \u201csanctuary city\u201d ordinance that bars city resources from being used for immigration enforcement and city departments from sharing information on people without legal status with federal immigration authorities, in anticipation of potential mass deportations under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Councilmembers voted unanimously on the measure, joining more than a dozen cities across the United States with similar provisions. Sanctuary cities or states are not legal terms but have come to symbolize a pledge to protect and support immigrant communities and decline to voluntarily supply information to immigration enforcement officials. Advocates say they are havens for immigrants to feel safe and be able to report crime without fear of deportation.",
      "The measure will come back to the council for a second vote as a formality. Mayor Karen Bass, who has the power to veto it, has said she supports the ordinance.",
      "With Trump's promises of a vast immigration crackdown upon his return to the White House in January, immigration advocates urged Los Angeles council members to move swiftly.",
      "\u201cWe're going to send a very clear message that the city of Los Angeles will not cooperate with ICE in any way,\u201d said councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. \u201cWe want people to feel protected and be able to have faith in their government and that women can report domestic violence, crimes.\u201d",
      "Soto-Martinez, one of the councilmembers who introduced the initial motion last year, said his parents and many of his constituents are immigrants without legal status. They are \u201cembedded in the larger community,\u201d from cooking and cleaning houses to working as nannies, he said.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear how much will change under the ordinance since the city already does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Los Angeles Police Department has a policy mandating that officers not inquire about a person's immigration status or make arrests based on legal status. Its new police chief Jim McDonnell has also pledged not to cooperate with mass deportations work or federal agencies on immigration enforcement issues.",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive directive in 2019 that offered protections to immigrants, but Tuesday\u2019s ordinance would codify those protections into city law.",
      "The state of California has similar protections. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown signed sanctuary state legislation in 2017 to bar police from asking people about their immigration status or participating in federal immigration enforcement activities.",
      "Then-President Trump responded by attempting to withhold funding from sanctuary cities and favor cities that pledge to cooperate with immigration enforcement for federal grants.",
      "Cities from New York to San Francisco have long-standing policies to support immigrants, but criticism of those measures grew with the influx of migrants. Some of the backlash occurred after Republican governors in Texas and Florida began bussing migrants to Democratic-led \u201csanctuary cities\u201d last year in what critics have called political stunts.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has since called for expanded cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities, attacking the current city policies limiting such communication as detrimental to public safety.",
      "Migrants were also bused to Los Angeles, though in smaller numbers.",
      "More than 100 people gathered on the steps of city hall Tuesday morning ahead of the vote to urge the city council to enact the ordinance.",
      "Martha Ar\u00e9valo, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in LA, called the law \u201clong overdue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is Trump 2.0 where he ran on a platform of hate and division and separating families and mass deportations,\u201d Arevalo said. \u201cIt's traumatic to the immigrant community. There's a lot of trauma, there's a lot of fear.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the sanctuary city ordinance, many of whom are people without legal status themselves, spoke on their personal experiences with the threat of deportation.",
      "\u201cI grew up in the shadows, constantly fearing separation from my loved ones and being sent back to a place we had fought so hard to escape,\u201d said Jesus Carreon, a current student at Harvard Law School and graduate of University of Southern California, asking the council to vote in favor of the sanctuary policy.",
      "Some brought up concerns that it could encourage more migrants without legal status to come to the city and take resources away from addressing homelessness.",
      "\u201cI'm sure there's millions of people that want to come to LA and we can't be a sanctuary city for everybody,\u201d Charles Brister told the city council before the vote. \u201cWe have people in this city who don't have beds, American citizens who are homeless.\u201d",
      "Mayor Bass said recently \u201cthis moment demands urgency. Immigrant protections make our communities stronger and our city better.\u201d"

      "Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani have asked a judge to penalize him even more",
      "Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani asked a judge Wednesday to penalize him even further, saying he continues to falsely accuse them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Attorneys for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that Giuliani repeated the allegations against them on two recent broadcasts of his nightly show on the social media platform X. The women asked the judge to hold Giuliani in contempt and impose sanctions against him.",
      "A lawyer for Giuliani, Joseph M. Cammarata, said Wednesday that he had not seen the court filing and could not respond to its specific claims. But he called it an effort to intimidate the former New York City mayor.",
      "\u201cWe will not relent,\" Cammarata said at a news conference in New York City. He accused attorneys for Freeman and Moss of \u201cdoing everything in their power to break an 80-year-old patriot.\u201d",
      "Giuliani was found liable for defamation and ordered to pay $148 million last year to Freeman and Moss for accusing them of ballot tampering as he pushed then-President Donald Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani accused them of sneaking in ballots in suitcases, counting ballots multiple times and tampering with voting machines.",
      "Lawyers for Freeman and Moss said in Wednesday's court filing that Giuliani referred to them again on his recent video broadcasts on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.",
      "They said Giuliani said \u201cthey never let me show the tapes that show them quadruple counting the, the, the ballots.\u201d The filing accuses Giuliani of saying his tapes showed Freeman and Moss \u201cpassing these little little hard drives that we maintain were used to fix the machines right and they say it was candy.\u201d",
      "Even after the $148 million judgment against him, Freeman and Moss said Giuliani has continued to falsely accuse them. The U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., has permanently barred him from making any statements that suggest the women engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election."

      "The S&P 500 was down 0.7%, as of 2:16 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 111 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite sank 0.9%.",
      "Target's 20.6% drop followed its report showing weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The retailer also gave a forecast for profit in the upcoming holiday season that was below analysts\u2019 estimates.",
      "Target\u2019s performance stood in stark contrast to rival Walmart, which reported another quarter of stellar sales Tuesday and released optimistic projections for the holiday season.",
      "Hints about how U.S. consumers are doing are under particular scrutiny, given that they'll need to keep spending if the U.S. economy is to continue to avoid a recession. Shoppers are contending with high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates.",
      "Besides Target, several lower-priced retailers were among the biggest losers in the S&P 500. Dollar General fell 3.7%, and Dollar Tree sank 3.5%.",
      "On the winning end of Wall Street was Williams-Sonoma, which jumped 27.4% after the home retailer delivered better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The parent of Pottery Barn also said it expects overall sales to fall by less this fiscal year than it had earlier forecast.",
      "The headliner of the day, week and perhaps the rest of the year for Wall Street will arrive after trading ends for the day. That\u2019s when superstar stock Nvidia will unveil its results for the latest quarter.",
      "The company has grown into a $3.6 trillion behemoth because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. It\u2019s grown so fast, with its stock nearly tripling for the year through Tuesday, that pressure has grown for it to show it can keep leapfrogging past analysts\u2019 already high expectations.",
      "So far, Nvidia has hurdled such expectations with impressive results each quarter. That\u2019s made it one of the most influential stocks in the market, whose movement can almost singlehandedly alter the S&P 500\u2019s direction.",
      "Trading in the options market suggests Nvidia\u2019s upcoming profit report is the most anticipated event left in 2024, more than even the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming meeting on interest rates, according to Barclays Capital.",
      "Outside of Nvidia, financial markets are still absorbing the impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election earlier this month.",
      "Wells Fargo Investment Institute on Wednesday raised its forecasts for where Treasury yields will end next year, in part because of expectations that Trump\u2019s policies will drive faster U.S. economic growth and inflation. Strategists at the institute also raised their forecast for where the S&P 500 will end next year because of that faster growth, which should translate into bigger corporate profits, along with easier regulations.",

      "The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and Transport Workers Union Local 234 announced the one-year agreement Wednesday. It calls for union members to receive a 5% raise and an unspecified pension adjustment. The contract also has language aimed at improving the personal safety of frontline workers, including installing bulletproof enclosures for drivers since many face violence and harassment.",
      "Union President Brian Pollitt said a ratification vote would be held Dec. 6.",
      "The agreement comes about two weeks after union members had voted to authorize a strike once their one-year contract with SEPTA expired Nov. 8. Union leaders, though, agreed to delay a strike as long as they felt progress was being made at the bargaining table.",
      "Local 234 has about 5,000 members, including bus, subway and trolley operators, mechanics, cashiers, maintenance people and custodians.",
      "Pollitt said Wednesday that avoiding a strike was a priority, noting that public transit is a \u201cnecessary need\u201d for many residents, including students who take SEPTA trains and buses to school and workers who rely on the agency to get to their jobs.",
      "\"We got a fair deal, and now we need to focus on making sure SEPTA stays strong for everyone who depends on it,\" Pollitt said.",
      "Scott Sauer, SEPTA's interim general manager, said both sides worked hard to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis agreement is fair to our hardworking frontline employees and responsible to the customers and taxpayers,\u201d he said.",
      "SEPTA, which has repeatedly said its financial health is uncertain, recently proposed an across-the-board 21.5% fare increase that would start New Year\u2019s Day as well as severe service cuts that would take effect next summer. The agency has scheduled a Dec. 13 public hearing on the plan.",
      "If approved by SEPTA\u2019s board, riders would pay the increase on top of a proposed interim average fare increase of 7.5% the panel is due to consider later this month. If passed, it would take effect Dec. 1. If both increases take effect, the single fare cost of riding the city bus and subway would go from $2 to $2.90. SEPTA key fares, where riders get discounts for using a prepaid card to pay fares that now range from $3.75 to $6.50, depending on the zone they use, would range from $5 to $8.75 on Jan. 1.",
      "SEPTA last raised fares in 2017, and the proposed increase would be expected to bring in an additional $23 million for this fiscal year and $45 million per year starting in 2026.",
      "The nation\u2019s sixth-largest mass transit system, SEPTA faces an annual structural budget deficit of $240 million as federal pandemic aid phases out. It lost out on about $161 million in state aid since the Republican-controlled state Senate declined to vote on Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s proposal for $283 million in new state aid to public transit. Instead, lawmakers approved a one-time payment to the state trust fund for transit systems, of which SEPTA got $46 million."

But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",

And just to see the size of it, that was pretty cool,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had already studied whales a couple of weeks ago, so it was fun to see one in person and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what the baleen looks like in real life,\u2019 and \u2018Where is the blow hole?\u2019 \u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled support Tuesday for a Republican effort to ban Democrat Sarah McBride \u2014 the first transgender person to be elected to Congress \u2014 from using women\u2019s restrooms in the Capitol once she's sworn into office next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have men in women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Johnson told The Associated Press. \"I\u2019ve been consistent about that with anyone I\u2019ve talked to about this.\u201d",
      "Johnson earlier in the day emphasized the need to \u201ctreat all persons with dignity and respect,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is an issue that Congress has never had to address before, and we\u2019re going to do that in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it.\u201d",
      "A resolution proposed Monday by GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina would prohibit any lawmakers and House employees from \u201cusing single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.\u201d Mace said the bill is aimed specifically at McBride, who was elected to the House this month from Delaware.",
      "The debate over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity has been prevalent across the U.S. and was a focal point of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls and women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m absolutely, 100% gonna stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women\u2019s restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms,\u201d Mace said told reporters Tuesday. The second-term congresswoman added that Johnson assured her the bathroom provision would be included in any changes to House rules for the next Congress.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready to pick up the mantle.\u201d",
      "Democrats, including McBride, denounced the GOP effort as \u201cbullying\u201d and a \u201cdistraction.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,\u201d McBride said. \u201cWe should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\u201d",
      "Rep. Katherine Clark, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, quipped that House Republicans are already \u201coff to a great start.\"",
      "\u201cWhat are they talking about there, on day one, is where one member out of 435 is going, where she is going to use the bathroom?\u201d the Massachusetts lawmaker said during a press conference Tuesday. \u201cThat is their focus?\u201d",
      "McBride was elected to the House this month after building a national profile as an LGBTQ+ activist and raising more than $3 million in campaign contributions from around the country. She became the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in the United States in 2016, when she spoke at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "After her election win earlier this month, McBride said that her victory was \u201ca testament to Delawareans that we have shown time and time again that in this state of neighbors, we judge candidates based on their ideas and not their identities.\u201d",

      "1. The cost of living crisis isn't over",
      "Any trip to the supermarket reminds us that prices have risen sharply in recent years.",
      "Compared with October 2020, prices of goods and services are 24% higher  - driven by increases in food and energy prices.",

      "Lots of people are still struggling to pay back debts that built up over the last few years. Some \u00a33.7bn is collectively owed to energy suppliers from people unable to pay their gas and electricity bills, for example.",
      "2. Inflation is volatile",
      "Analysts had expected a smaller rise in inflation than 2.3%.",
      "But you shouldn't put too much store on a one-month figure.",
      "As with any economic statistic, one month's data can buck a general trend and should be considered alongside other published data.",

      "\"I catch this train every single day,\" he said. \"It either doesn't turn up on time, or doesn't turn up full stop,\" he said. \"We've got dirty old rolling stock. It's a sham, it really is.\"",

      "The prime minister said he understood farmers' concerns and \"wants to support\" them but added \"the vast majority\" would be unaffected.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",

      "The farming tax row explained",
      "Watch: BBC Verify explains the inheritance tax row",
      "How many farms would be affected by Budget changes?",
      "However, many farmers argue that while they are asset rich - for example in terms of their land and livestock - they are cash poor and the changes would mean they would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "Ahead of the protest, around 1,800 National Farmers' Union (NFU) members met near Parliament as part of a mass lobby of MPs.",
      "The group's president, Tom Bradshaw, gave an impassioned speech describing the tax changes as destructive, a \"stab in the back\" for farmers, wrong and unacceptable.",
      "He told protesters the changes were the \"straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Later, speaking to Sky News, he said Labour had \"destroyed\" a \"contract\" between farming and the government dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"We'd love to pay more tax,\" Mr Bradshaw added.",
      "\"If we get proper margins from food production, and we end up swelling the Treasury coffers, bring it on.",
      "\"But at the moment the supply chain doesn't give us those returns that enables us to save the money to pay the inheritance tax that this government now wants to take.\"",
      "He added that Environment Secretary Steve Reed said when he was in opposition that Labour would not change agricultural property relief.",
      "Since 2019, pig farming costs have risen by 54%, cattle by 44% and cereal by 43%, as food, fuel and fertiliser prices increase at a rate far outstripping the increases farmers can charge on what they produce. Subsidies that farmers get have also been declining since Brexit.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300 - although that figure may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "The number of the UK's 210,000 farms that could be affected by the inheritance tax change is also disputed.",
      "The government says it will affect the wealthiest 500 estates each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) have estimated up to 70,000 farms worth more than \u00a31m could be affected.",
      "Between 2021 and 2022, 117 farms with a value of more than \u00a32.5m were inherited.",
      "Reed told the Commons Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday that many farmers protesting over the tax changes were \"wrong\" about the policy - and he rejected claims the government had underestimated how many people would be affected.",
      "\"Many of them, probably happily, are wrong because there are things that they can do to plan their tax affairs as most businesses or asset owners would do to limit their liability,\" he said.",
      "He said: \"The numbers I've heard bandied around are enormous and very, very frightening if people were to believe them.\"",
      "He acknowledged the changes would be \"unsettling\" and said he was \"listening\" to concerns, but insisted that most farmers would not face a hike.",
      "Among those attending Tuesday's events was Gloucestershire livestock farmer David Barton, who estimates his business - which has been in the family since 1913 - is worth around \u00a35m in assets, but says it doesn't make much money year-on-year.",
      "Mr Barton is worried the proposed changes to inheritance tax could see his son facing a \u00a3800,000 bill and said the Budget \"has just ripped the heart out of us\".",
      "He is now considering gifting his estate, which he believes would fall outside of inheritance tax if he does not die within seven years, but feared he was not in a financial position to stop working.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:01:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Spray foam insulation was previously subsidised in England under the government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners with spray foam insulation are struggling to sell or remortgage as some major lenders are rejecting properties with it fitted, the BBC has found.",
      "A quarter of the UK's biggest mortgage providers will not lend against homes with spray foam in the roof, our research suggests.",
      "It is estimated as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with much of it installed under the previous government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "\"We were blissfully unaware of any issues to do with it until we put the house on the market,\" said Wendy Rowe, whose family struggled to sell her late father\u2019s home and paid thousands to have the insulation removed.",
      "Some mortgage firms are reluctant to deal with homes with spray foam insulation due to concerns over poor fitting leaving moisture trapped and roof timbers at risk of decay.",
      "But the Insulation Manufacturers Association said spray foam can be beneficial if properly installed, and it was worried homeowners could be needlessly driven to \"cowboy\" removals companies.",
      "Ms Rowe told the BBC that when her father Alan Chawner was offered spray foam insulation in his loft, he thought it would make his ex-council property in Leicester  warmer and cut his energy bills.",
      "As a pensioner who claimed the attendance allowance, the entire \u00a34,331 cost of the  installation was covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England until 31 March 2021.",
      "'Left high and dry'",
      "However, the work was not up to scratch, according to a report by Stephen Hodgson, the former boss of the Property Care Association (PCA) who now inspects properties with spray foam and trains surveyors.",
      "After sales stalled and difficult conversations with lenders, Ms Rowe agreed to replace the roof entirely, splitting the cost of nearly \u00a310,000 with new buyers.",
      "She said it has cost the family thousands more in surveyors' and administration fees and utility bills.",
      "The firm that installed the spray foam, SealSixty, gave the family \u00a3400 as a gesture of goodwill and said the work met all the requirements set out by the Green Homes Grant scheme at the time.",
      "Ms Rowe said that her family had been \"left high and dry\".",
      "\"It was installed under a government initiative, and you really don\u2019t expect them to turn their back,\" she said.",
      "What is spray foam insulation?",
      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "While a recent report by the Health and Safety Executive highlighted situations where using open cell was low-risk, it cautioned against applying it directly to roof tiles.",
      "Homes insulated in government scheme go mouldy",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",
      "The nature of spray foam can make it tricky for valuers acting on behalf of lenders to inspect the condition of roof timbers.",
      "When the BBC contacted the 20 largest lenders in the UK, five of them, TSB Bank, Skipton Building Society, Co-operative Bank, Principality and equity release lender Aviva - said they did not lend against properties where spray foam is found in the roof space.",
      "The Yorkshire Building Society and Metro Bank said they would not usually lend where there is a significant amount of spray foam.",
      "Equity release provider More 2 Life told the BBC it will only lend on properties with spray foam where it was fitted as part of an authorised new build and has the necessary documentation.",
      "Other lenders such as Lloyds, Nationwide, Barclays, the NatWest Group and Santander have said they consider applications on a case-by-case basis, and will take a valuer's report into account.",
      "They may, however, ask homeowners for documentation showing it has been installed correctly or for a specialist report to be carried out.",
      "In 2023, the PCA published an inspection protocol in a bid to help surveyors and lenders assess any potential risk in pitched roofs.",
      "But homeowners like Gary Wright feel like they have been \"left in limbo\".",
      "When his two-year fixed-rate mortgage was up for renewal, he hoped to find a better rate.",
      "But when he applied he was shocked to discover open cell spray foam had been installed in 2009. It had not come up during surveys when he had bought the house.",
      "He decided to remove most of the foam in the loft himself, after receiving several expensive quotes.",
      "A surveyor still recommended a full roof report and Mr Wright felt he had to renew his mortgage with his current lender at a less preferable rate.",
      "\"We know that in the next two years, we need to get this fixed, and I can\u2019t afford to right now,\" he said.",
      "\"This phrase 'spray foam' has created fear [among lenders] based on a lack of knowledge,\" Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, told the BBC.",
      "He suggested \"hares were set running\" by previous industry guidance that has since been withdrawn.",
      "\"Insulating is a very good thing,\" he said, adding: \"But as with any building work, it needs to be done correctly\".",
      "He said the organisation was also concerned about unregulated companies targeting older, potentially vulnerable, homeowners pushing them to pay for an overpriced removal service during cold calls.",
      "The Homeowners Alliance (HOA) does not recommend installing spray foam until issues with lenders and rogue traders are resolved.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",
      "\"No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,\" laughs Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, there is going to be a shortage in uranium, and that will subsequently impact power prices,\u201d he said.",

      "The scheme provided meals to 287,000 children in its first year, at a cost of \u00a3135m. It is currently in its second year, with the cost having risen to \u00a3140m.",
      "The policy is currently being budgeted for on a year-by-year basis.",
      "The mayor said: \"We will be publishing our budget in due course and setting out confirmation that this policy will carry on next year.\"",
      "He added: \"My promise to Londoners is for as long as I am mayor, children going to state primary schools will receive this offer of a universal free school meal.\"",
      "Khan was re-elected in May and his third term of office ends in May 2028.",
      "Speaking to the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, Richard Watts, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said \u201cthe scheme has been enormously successful\u201d and \u201call the benefits that we hoped we would see based on previous evidence we are now seeing city wide\u201d.",
      "However, he said next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "He said: \"The whole of the mayor\u2019s budget is \u00a3130m, we think free school meals will cost \u00a3140m next year so even if we canned everything else that we did, universal free school meals will never be met from the GLA (Greater London Authority) mayor budget.",
      "\"Therefore we will announce that funding in the group budget papers in due course.\u201d",
      "Khan launched the scheme in 2023 as a one-year emergency measure to help families with the cost of living, paid for using higher than expected business rate receipts.",
      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",
      "The committee heard that the GLA and mayor would have to wait until next year when the government is due to set out its multi-year plans for local government funding before setting budgets for the mayor\u2019s manifesto pledges.",
      "The mayor\u2019s chief of staff David Bellamy told the assembly\u2019s budget committee the free school meals scheme was \"not something substantively that the GLA mayoral budget has the resources to do, so that is something we will be dealing with in the group budget from the total income sources available to the mayor - we will set that out in the draft budget in January\u201d.",
      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",
      "The scheme had also been \u201cvalued highly by those working in schools\u201d, the report found, with senior leaders saying it had \u201chelped to address the problems of hidden hunger and food insecurity\u201d.",
      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",
      "Looking at the impact on pupils\u2019 performance in school, the report says that the policy \u201cappears to be supporting calmer behaviour in the classroom, with school staff reporting afternoon lessons running more smoothly when children have had a hot, healthy meal\u201d.",

      "Logan Paul, the massively popular social media personality, is facing fresh questions over his cryptocurrency dealings amid ongoing concerns he may have profited from misleading fans.",
      "The BBC has seen new evidence suggesting he promoted investments without revealing he had a financial interest in them.",
      "The influence of Paul - whose YouTube channel has more than 23 million followers - appears to have caused prices in these investments to spike, leading to suggestions he could have profited from sales of any tokens he held.",
      "Paul also currently faces a multi-million-dollar lawsuit over a failed crypto project called CryptoZoo.",
      "He denies any wrongdoing.",
      "The BBC has discovered that shortly before Paul tweeted about a particular crypto coin in 2021, an anonymous crypto wallet with close connections to his public wallet had traded in the coin.",
      "That anonymous wallet went on to make a $120,000 (\u00a392,000) profit.",
      "Crypto wallets (which can be physical devices or an online service) hold users' keys to their accounts, and let people send, receive and spend crypto.",
      "Our finding comes after Time Magazine reported similar activity involving a different cryptocurrency and another anonymous wallet.",

      "Minutes after abandoning the interview, we received a lawyer\u2019s letter on behalf of Paul, warning us of the possible consequences if we published our findings.",

      "Logan Paul built a worldwide following as an internet celebrity by uploading short video clips, first to the now-closed platform Vine, and then on YouTube.",
      "About three years ago, Paul\u2019s videos began mentioning cryptocurrency (crypto, as it is commonly known) more and more.",
      "Crypto is a form of digital money that uses secure technology to work, without the need for a central bank.",

      "These are usually inspired by internet jokes or memes and are supported by online communities. Meme coins have no other real purpose other than to be traded and, since they have no intrinsic worth, their value can - and often does - drop to zero.",
      "Paul extolled the virtues of an Elon Musk-themed meme coin known as Elongate. \u201cElongate made me rich. Elon baby let\u2019s go!\u201d Paul announced in a video clip to Maverick Club, his subscription-only fan club.",
      "Following this namecheck, the price of Elongate rose by over 6,000% to an all-time high. It then remained at that price for a few hours before it crashed.",
      "We cannot be sure of Logan Paul\u2019s intentions when he released his clip. However, it seems likely that his mention of Elongate affected its price.",

      "The anonymous crypto wallet analysed by the BBC appears to have close connections to Paul.",
      "Anyone can see the transactions made by a wallet, but the owner can choose to remain anonymous. If an owner attaches their name or personal details it becomes a public wallet.",
      "We could see that the wallet first received funds in February 2021 from a public wallet owned by Logan Paul. It then started buying and trading crypto.",

      "The wallet was later paid funds from Maverick Club and held Elongate when Paul promoted it on 10 May 2021.",
      "Shortly after, it also traded in another Musk-related meme coin - after Paul had tweeted that it was headed \u201cto the moon\u201d.  In the crypto community, this means someone believes the price of the coin is about to shoot up.",
      "About an hour before Paul\u2019s tweet, the unknown wallet purchased almost $160,000 (\u00a3123,000) worth of the token. The tweet prompted an influx of buyers, spiking the price.",
      "Twelve hours later, the wallet sold most of its holding. The total profit made from this trade appears to be just over $120,000 (\u00a392,000).",
      "Logan Paul chose not to respond to the BBC\u2019s allegations regarding the crypto wallet, the trading that occurred within it, or his connection to it, despite responding to some of our other requests via his legal team.",
      "Dink Doink",
      "In June 2021, Paul also promoted a meme coin called \u201cDink Doink\u201d.",
      "Anyone who bought it would own shares in a cartoon character that resembled a metal coil. They would earn a portion of its earnings if it appeared in a TV show or film.",
      "Paul promoted the token on Twitter (as the site was then known), and told a Telegram group dedicated to Dink Doink that he \u201cbelieved\u201d in it, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go crazy.\u201d",
      "Again, this led to a huge influx of buyers, causing Dink Doink's value to spike. Then - following a familiar pattern - large-scale holders of the token began selling, causing its price to fall by 96% in just two weeks.",
      "Time Magazine analysed another anonymous wallet that had bought Dink Doink prior to Logan Paul\u2019s promotion of the coin and then sold its holding shortly after. This wallet later sent $100,000 (\u00a378,000) to Paul\u2019s public wallet.",
      "When the BBC asked the influencer about this wallet, his lawyers did not deny that it belonged to him, or was held for his benefit, but were adamant that the $100,000 that was transferred was not related to Dink Doink.",
      "They do accept that Paul traded Dink Doink, but say he only made $17,000 (\u00a313,400).",
      "Puerto Rico",
      "For several months, Paul refused to be interviewed by the BBC.",
      "Then, unexpectedly, he agreed to talk to us at the boxing gym in Puerto Rico that he co-owns with his brother.",
      "We sent Paul a list of the allegations we wanted him to respond to, and his PR team requested we travel to the Caribbean island, so he could answer in person.",
      "They also insisted we flew into the island while it was being pummeled by Tropical Storm Ernesto, which had knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "At the gym, we noticed a strange atmosphere - with a suspicious number of his own cameras pointed at us. Paul\u2019s assistant insisted our cameras should be recording from the moment the star entered the room, because of his strict schedule and timekeeping.",
      "Then things became even stranger. Instead of Logan Paul, a lookalike arrived and sat down in front of our reporter, Matt Shea, and began impersonating the YouTuber.",
      "We called him out and began complaining to Paul\u2019s assistant, asking whether the real Logan Paul would be coming. At that moment, a group of people suddenly appeared, apparently from nowhere, wielding banners and shouting that the BBC were \u201cpaedophiles\u201d.",
      "We had flown all that way just to be trolled.",
      "In the past few years, a number of celebrities have run into legal trouble for promoting crypto to followers without disclosing that they had vested interests.",
      "Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m (\u00a31m) in 2022 for promoting a token called EthereumMax on her Instagram account.",
      "According to Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the body policing the US investment industry, if a celebrity is promoting a particular crypto token, they are \u201csupposed to tell you if they get paid, how much they get paid, whether they own the tokens, whether they made money on the tokens, whether they actually know something about the project\u201d.",
      "CryptoZoo",
      "Logan Paul is now facing a lawsuit concerning his next venture in crypto - CryptoZoo.",
      "This was marketed as an online trading card game, but instead of cards, CryptoZoo was to use NFTs (non-fungible tokens) - collectible pieces of digital art that can have a value of their own.",
      "To play CryptoZoo, it was necessary to buy a cryptocurrency called Zoo Token, that could then be used to buy NFT \u201ceggs\u201d.",
      "These eggs were supposed to eventually hatch into NFT \u201canimals\u201d that would breed and give birth to NFT \u201chybrid animals\u201d with names like penguin-shark and panda-fin.",
      "Paul\u2019s team claimed these hybrid animals would somehow make participants money by passively generating more Zoo Tokens.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun game that makes you money,\u201d he told his audience shortly ahead of the launch in September 2021.",

      "\u201cI was really excited to be part of something that he was doing.\u201d",

      "\u201cAfter a certain point, you start to realise that something\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "The value of the Zoo Tokens and the eggs started to plummet. Rueben says he personally lost \u00a333,000.",
      "At least 130 investors are now involved in a lawsuit against Paul (Rueben is not one of them).  They claim they lost about $4.2m (\u00a33.25m).",
      "The lawyer behind the claim, Tom Kherkher - himself a popular YouTuber on legal affairs - says the failure to deliver the game forms only part of the case.",
      "He says leaked messages reveal Paul and his team were involved in a \u201cstealth launch\u201d of the Zoo Tokens, allowing them to quietly buy in at a low price.",
      "\u201cThe team appeared to agree that they can begin selling once the total value of all the Zoo Token in circulation hits $200m [\u00a3157m],\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIf you had that document with that exact verbiage issued by a CEO of a publicly traded company, they would be charged with fraud in two seconds. That is insider trading.\u201d",
      "Paul has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing relating to CryptoZoo. Instead, he has laid the blame on other members of the team whom he also says failed to deliver the promised features.",
      "Earlier this year, Paul announced a partial compensation scheme for disappointed investors. He promised to refund people who had bought the NFT eggs, but only if they agreed not sue him for anything relating to CryptoZoo.",
      "Paul is also bringing a libel claim against one of his online detractors in the USA, for claims made about his motives.",
      "Logan Paul\u2019s immense popularity depends on his fans, and shows little sign of declining.",
      "In recent years, Paul has turned his hand to boxing and wrestling, as well as launching the drinks company Prime, with British influencer KSI.",
      "The product became notorious for its viral launch - with only a limited stocks made available, Prime spawned a re-sale market with bottles being advertised for hundreds of pounds. It was a testament to both Logan Paul and KSI\u2019s influence over their primarily young audience.",
      "However, for at least one fan, his image has been tarnished for good.",
      "\u201cOnce you listen to someone and trust what they\u2019re saying and they betray that trust,\u201d says Rueben Tauk, \u201ctheir words don\u2019t mean anything to you any more.\u201d",

      "\"What we kept our eyes on was making sure that we made him feel as relatable and as normal as possible... whatever normal is in the extraordinary situation he\u2019s in.\u201d",
      "The film's villain, played by Jason Bateman, is known only as The Traveller and is often heard via an earpiece worn by Egerton's character Kopek.",
      "\u201cThere were times when I was lucky enough to have Jason Bateman come in and perform with me from another room and it was an incredible luxury,\" said Egerton.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:49:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

      "Musical inspiration can strike any time and anywhere.",

      "\"I'm under the impression that anything can be a song, if you approach it in the right manner,\" Ogden reasons.",

      "To Blossoms, Gary has now become muse and mascot, spirit animal and unofficial sixth member of the band.",
      "Both the song and the replica of Gary that the group have taken on tour are fan favourites.",
      "Some would also call it a gimmick, which is partly true, except that not even Ogden could seriously have calculated that the song and the story behind it would really catch on.",
      "\"It has connected with people,\" the singer says. \"I didn't anticipate it, but I knew I wanted to have something that made people go, what's that?",
      "\"Even if people think it is ludicrous, it's an entry point. And people were just ready for a bit of fun, I suppose.",

      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",

      "\"I think if you call an album Gary, and you write a song about a fibreglass gorilla, you're out in the open, in terms of someone's going to say something like that,\" the singer responds.",
      "\"But I think there is depth on the album, of course, because there are songs like Mothers, which is about friendship and growing up. And then Why Do I Give You The Worst Of Me? is a very personal song.",
      "\"So I think someone's just thought, yeah, there's a song about fibreglass gorilla, maybe that's a bit of fun. And I Like Your Look\u2019s not taking itself too seriously either.",

      "\"We feel like we\u2019re at the peak of our powers this year.\"",
      "Wythenshawe Park was the \"best gig we've ever done\", he says.",
      "\"We put everything into that show, and in no way did it feel disappointing. It blew us away even more than we expected.\"",
      "After that, when the band came to plan a full UK tour, they weren't sure whether to play in Manchester again.",

    "title": "Silent Men film asks why so many still struggle to open up",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:59:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Scottish filmmaker Duncan Cowles set out to ask why men tend to bottle up their emotions.",
    "story": [
      "Male mental health is back in the spotlight ahead of International Men's Day on Tuesday (19 November). The subject has received much more prominence in the last decade - something many would argue is long overdue.",
      "But while the high rates of male suicide have put the topic firmly on the national agenda - huge numbers of men still find it difficult to be openly vulnerable and discuss their feelings.",
      "With suicide the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK, a new film explores why many men still bottle up their emotions, and asks whether such ingrained, systemic behaviour can be changed.",
      "Duncan Cowles, who directs Silent Men, is the first to admit his own struggles to open up emotionally to those closest to him, joking that tackling the subject for the documentary was \"like dragging myself backwards through a hedge\".",
      "Speaking at the Sheffield Documentary Festival earlier this year, he told BBC News it was an important journey to go on because the risks of ignoring your emotions are far scarier.",
      "\"I think there's still a lot of societal pressure around those traditional masculine traits,\" Cowles says. \"Being strong and things associated with being a leader or this stable, reliable, dependable figure.",
      "\"There's maybe something still seductive about that idea of that old-fashioned man, that James Bond character that a lot of us maybe grew up with. I think it's still quite sought-after by a lot of people.",
      "\"Whereas my experience is when you're a bit more open and vulnerable, that can actually lead to stronger relationships, and therefore more joy, connection and fulfilment. And yet still we're drawn to being closed off.\"",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "The idea of men suffering in silence is nothing new. It was 1854 when Henry David Thoreau wrote: \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"",
      "The fact that the essayist's most famous observation has survived for 170 years and is still quoted so widely today is a testament to its relatability - but also of how little progress has been made.",
      "Thoreau tapped into a feeling many men have, both then and now, of being unfulfilled - whether that's in their career, relationships or for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.",
      "Overwhelmed by the commitments or mundanity of day-to-day life, while simultaneously unwilling or unable to voice their emotions, men often find it hard to cope.",
      "Blue blanket theory",
      "\"I suppose it's always been something I've struggled with, opening up and showing emotions around family,\" Cowles says of his reasons for making the film.",
      "\"While I was at university, I'd done a little film which investigated that, but it always felt like this thing that I hadn't fully resolved in my life.\"",
      "Setting out to explore the subject further at the start of the film, Cowles posts an advert online, looking for men to speak to for the documentary. He then goes to interview some of those who reply.",
      "He travels around the country and speaks to men from different walks of life over several years. At one point, he attends a retreat where men gather for a weekend to do group therapy.",
      "\"I wanted to go on my own journey, parallel to speaking to men as part of the film. But it turned into a more personal film than I expected,\" he explains.",
      "The Scottish filmmaker interviews members of his own family and studies how their personalities shaped his own. \"My dad likes drilling holes in the wall, and his stamps, but he's not big on verbal communication,\" Cowles notes early on - painting a picture of fathers many will recognise.",
      "One trauma specialist interviewed for the film cites a study which found that babies in blue blankets - and therefore assumed to be boys - were touched for significantly less time than girls.",
      "\"So that's really interesting, what are we doing in our culture about socialising boys to not be touched as much, not be seen as vulnerable, not need emotional support as much as girls?\" she asks.",
      "\"The toughening up - 'be a brave boy, big boys don't cry' - that process of making you into a man, where someone has told you that that's what a man is, that a man has got to be emotionally strong.",
      "\"There are all these social constructs that kind of trap you, which is causing huge numbers of mental health issues for guys. We've got a big problem on our hands.\"",
      "Silent Men is Cowles' first feature documentary, but he previously won a Bafta Scotland award for his short film Isabella.",
      "Asked if it was difficult to get the men featured in the film to talk about their feelings, Cowles replies: \"Strangely not, because there's something about speaking to a stranger that can sometimes feel a lot easier than speaking to someone who's in your own family. I guess it's because you've less to lose.\"",
      "The insights from other men make for interesting viewing. One contributor, Ainslie, says his outlook changed after having a baby. But not necessarily in the way you might think - he says the responsibility of being a father actually meant there was less time and opportunity to find room for expressing his own emotions.",
      "Another man, Dom, tells his young son constantly how much he loves him, and says he hated the thought of anybody close to him dying without knowing how much they meant to him.",
      "One of the film's most affecting - and funniest - moments comes when the microphone Cowles' brother is using cuts out after the battery dies, and he uses that exact moment, when he can't fully be heard, to tell Duncan: \"I love you.\"",
      "Despite all the heavy talk, the film is peppered with moments of levity - the director occasionally cuts away abruptly from tough conversations to run footage of soothing shorelines and bumble bees on flowers.",
      "\"One thing I really wanted to do with this film is make it feel accessible, not all mental health based, but [to] also contain humour and leave people with a smile on their face,\" he says.",
      "The documentary builds towards a conclusion as Cowles sits down with his parents to tell them he loves them.",
      "While both are receptive, his father is somewhat dismissive of the \"airy-fairy\" nature of showing emotions, suggesting it's \"not a normal thing for a man\".",
      "Therefore, his father argues, if somebody isn't opening up, that's actually a good sign, as not feeling the need to be vulnerable means they are generally feeling content.",
      "Reflecting on his father's comments now, Cowles says: \"He comes from a generation where he doesn't want to see someone visibly upset, so if you're showing nothing, then that's a good thing [to him] because it means you're OK. I know what he means.",
      "\"Younger people seem to have a different opinion on these kinds of things, and they are more willing to open up,\" he notes. \"There's that awareness of the issue.\"",
      "Cowles admits on camera his worry that he will pretend to have made progress for the purposes of giving the film a happy ending, when in reality there may not have been any significant change.",
      "But several months after filming wrapped, Cowles says making the film \"definitely has\" altered his behaviour.",
      "\"I wouldn't say it's a Hollywood transformation,\" he laughs. \"It's been quite a gradual thing, and I wouldn't say I'm perfect by any means.",
      "\"But compared to what I was like before, my partner is very appreciative that I've changed, that I'm more conscious of it and able to recognise when I should open up a bit more.\"",
      "Silent Men is screened at Sheffield DocFest in June and is released in UK cinemas on 19 November."

      "Ms Kaumba wore Mbuya\u2019s top and \"chitenge\" - a piece of patterned cloth wrapped around the waist. And Mbuya\u2019s first outfit was a silver pantsuit.",
      "\"I thought it would be nice to dress up Mbuya in high fashion and then take photographs of her in her natural habitat,\" Ms Kaumba tells the BBC.",
      "That natural habitat is a farm in the village of 10 Miles, just north of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.",
      "Most often Ms Chola is photographed in all her glamour outside - often sitting on an elegant wooden chair or lounging on a leather sofa.",
      "In the background are exposed brick buildings with corrugated iron roofs, ploughed fields, mango trees and maize crops.",
      "\"I was so nervous when I posted that first photo. I left my phone for 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes there were 1,000 likes,\" Ms Kaumba says.",
      "\"My mind was blown. The comments were flying in and people were asking for more.\"",
      "It was in April 2024 that the Granny Series really took off - after Ms Kaumba posted a series of photos of her grandmother in a red Adidas dress, several chunky, golden necklaces and a glittering jewelled crown.",
      "\"It surprised me to hear that so many people around the world love me,\" Ms Chola says - who does not know her exact age because she does not have a birth certificate.",

      "To a blue, black and green sequined top, complete with a golden snake necklace and bracelet.",
      "And Mbuya\u2019s personal favourite - jeans, a graphic T-shirt with her image on the front and a blonde wig.",
      "\"I had never worn jeans or a wig before - so I was happy, and I was dancing.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",
      "At the heart of it all are eye-catching accessories - bold sunglasses, oversized hats, necklaces, bracelets, pendants, rings, gloves, bags, blonde wigs, crowns.",
      "That influence has come directly from her grandmother, who has \"always been a lover of pearls and bangles\".",
      "In one particularly playful scene called GOAT - short for greatest of all time - Ms Chola appears with a goat - that is decked out in Mbuya\u2019s beloved pearls.",
      "Other accessories also reflect Chola\u2019s personality and story.",
      "In some shots Mbuya is holding the beloved radio that she carries around all day and takes to bed with her.",
      "Or she\u2019s clutching an \"ibende\" - a long wooden stick that over the years she has used to pound millet or cassava or maize.",
      "She is smoking a pipe or holding a metal cup full of tea, and hanging off the edge of the chair arm is an \"mbaula\" or charcoal brazier that Zambians often use for cooking - especially now that the country is plagued by severe power cuts.",
      "Ms Kaumba hopes that the Granny Series will highlight that older people still have a lot to offer - and making memories together is an important way to \"leave footprints for the next generation\".",
      "\"Do not write them off, love them just the same till the end because remember we will be just like them one day.\"",
      "As a result of Mbuya\u2019s photo shoots, Ms Kaumba\u2019s been hired by four granddaughters to style their grandmothers - aged between 70 and 96.",
      "Ms Chola hopes that the Granny Series will inspire people \"to live their lives and not worry about being judged by society\".",
      "She urges people to \"always forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you made. You can never change your past - but you can change your future\".",
      "The photo shoots have brought granddaughter and grandmother closer - and through their special bond Ms Kaumba has learnt so much more about her Mbuya\u2019s often difficult life.",
      "Ms Chola was raised by her grandparents, went to school until she was 12 or 13 and then, because of economic reasons, was forced to marry a man in his 30s.",
      "She had three children, ended up drinking heavily and eventually escaped the marriage.",
      "That trauma still haunts her - but her unexpected global fame has given her a new lease on life.",

      "With eternal bragging rights, five minutes of fame and (paltry) cash prizes up for grabs, the winners and organisers explain why these events have taken off.",
      "'It was a free event, why wouldn't I go?'",
      "Our fascination with celebrity lookalikes is nothing particularly new - Stars in Their Eyes, a show in which amateur lookalikes impersonate singers, ran on ITV for 16 years. The format was revived as Starstruck in 2022.",
      "But the latest competitions all have one thing in common: the celebrities are all young, attractive and male.",
      "Avani Johnson, who was at the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet contest, says she believes the latest trend has taken off because \"women are relishing the opportunity to objectify men in a complete switch in power dynamics\".",
      "She adds that it also gives us a chance \"to laugh at the absurdity of pageantry\".",
      "Miles Mitchell, a 20-year-old student, picked up the prize for the best Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lookalike last month at the competition that set this trend alight.",

      "\"The cost of living is still on people's minds, and people are concerned about the cost of Christmas,\" she said.",

      "An ambitious plan to map all 37 trillion cells in the human body is transforming understanding of how our bodies work, scientists report.",
      "The received wisdom said we were built from around 200 types of cell \u2013 such as heart muscle or nerve cells.",
      "Instead the Human Cell Atlas project has revealed there are thousands of cell types, with some appearing to be culprits in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis.",
      "In a flurry of announcements, the formation of the human skeleton and the early immune system have also been mapped out in detail.",
      "The novel insight is akin to moving from the maps of the 15th Century era of Joan of Arc and Richard III to what the phone in your pocket can load.",
      "The old maps of the body had the equivalent of major roads and significant geography but also areas cartographers labelled unknown or \u201cterra incognita\u201d.",
      "\u201c[Now] it looks more like a Google map, you have a high resolution view and then on top of that you have the Street View that explains what\u2019s going on, and then on top of that you can see the dynamic changes during the day when less cars are flowing or more cars are flowing,\u201d said Dr Aviv Regev, one of the founders who now works at now at Genentech.",
      "She added: \u201cThis is essential for us to understand and treat disease, cells are the basic unit of life, if things go wrong, they go wrong with our cells.\u201d",

      "The journal Nature has now published a series of 40 scientific discoveries as researchers work towards creating the first draft of the whole human cell atlas.",
      "\u201cThis is a major milestone that marks a great leap in understanding of the human body,\u201d said Dr Sarah Teichmann, from the University of Cambridge and one of the founders of the Human Cell Atlas.",
      "The latest discoveries include a map of the gut all the way from the mouth, down the oesphagus, into the stomach and intestines and out the anus.",
      "Researchers looked at the types of cells, where they were located and how they chatted to the other cells around them.",
      "Out of the 1.6 million cells analysed was a new form, called a gut metaplastic cell. It seems to play a role in exacerbating inflammation in the seven million people that live with inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cWe were able to uncover a pathogenic cell type that may play a role in some chronic conditions and could be a target for [drug] intervention in the future,\u201d said Dr Rasa Elmentaite, who did the research at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.",
      "There are more than 3,600 scientists across 100 countries collaborating on the Human Cell Atlas, which is one of the most ambitious projects in biology and has been described as the heir to the Human Genome Project to sequence the human genetic code.",
      "Another discovery showed how the human skeleton forms in the womb in the weeks after conception.",
      "First a scaffold of cartilage, like the wobbly bit on the end of your nose, forms. Then bone cells grow over it. This happens everywhere except for the very top of the skull to give the brain space to grow.",
      "Some of the genetic instructions involved in orchestrating this early developmental process are the same ones implicated in osteoarthritis decades later.",
      "\u201cUltimately, using this atlas could help us better understand the conditions of both the young and ageing skeleton,\u201d said Dr Ken To, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.",

      "It also gives ideas for engineering new immune-cell-based therapies in the laboratory for fighting diseases such as a cancer.",
      "Another example of the Human Cell Atlas in action came during the Covid pandemic when the detailed maps of the body allowed scientists to anticipate how the virus would move from tissue to tissue and identified the nose, mouth and eyes as key entry points to the body.",

      "The government has ordered a review of physician associates (PA) and anaesthesia associates (AA) in England after mounting concern about their use in the NHS.",
      "The number of PAs and AAs, who help doctors, are in the process of being rapidly expanded.",
      "But the British Medical Association has voiced concerns they are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and the lines with doctors are getting blurred.",
      "Announcing the review, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said there were legitimate concerns that needed looking at but he also criticised the \"toxic nature of the debate\", saying it had left PAs feeling demoralised.",
      "The review will look at how they are being deployed and what safeguards are needed going forward.",
      "Streeting said: \"Many physician associates are providing great care and freeing up doctors to do the things only doctors can do.",
      "\"But there are legitimate concerns over transparency for patients, scope of practice, and the substituting of doctors.",
      "\"These concerns have been ignored for too long, leading to a toxic debate where physicians feel ignored and PAs feel demoralised.\"",
      "He said he hoped the review would \"take the heat out of the issue\" and make sure \"we get the right people, in the right place, doing the right thing\u201d.",

      "It will report back early next year to inform the government\u2019s new 10-year plan for the NHS.",
      "Confusion around role",
      "The current NHS workforce plan sees PAs and AAs as a crucial part of the staffing mix in the health service.",
      "The numbers have been gradually increasing in recent years, but the plan, published last year, called for a rapid expansion from just over 3,000 to 12,000 by 2036.",
      "PAs can work in GP surgeries and hospitals. They are not authorised to prescribe, but they can order some scans, take medical histories and conduct physical examinations.",
      "AAs, which support surgery teams, are a much smaller group - there are only about 100 in the NHS.",
      "Both PAs and AAs have to complete a two-year master\u2019s degree. They usually need a bioscience-related first degree, but that is not a prerequisite.",
      "British Medical Association leader Dr Phil Banfield called for the rollout of new PAs to be paused while the review takes place.",

      "Following Mrs Pollitt\u2019s inquest, North Manchester coroner Joanne Kearsley warned about the use of PAs.",

      "But the academy was critical of the \"increasingly acrimonious and destructive debate\" which it said had been fuelled by unsubstantiated comments on social media and was damaging teamwork across the health service.",
      "Stephen Nash, head of  United Medical Associate Professionals, which represents PAs, said the review would be a chance to \"shine a real light\" on what is going on and provided much needed evidence in a \"very one-sided debate\".",

      "Diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2021, Cassandra Wardle is one of the women launching a group action against the biggest seller of talcum powder, Johnson & Johnson (J&J).",
      "Cassandra, who stumbled on a Facebook article linking cancer and talc following her diagnosis, said it was used on her as a baby and she continued to use it \"for 20 years or more\".",
      "\"You mimic your mum who used it,\" she said. \"Baby powder was supposed to be something deemed 'safe to use', even on a baby's bum.\"",
      "If it proceeds, the legal action would be the first of its kind brought against the pharmaceutical multinational in the UK.",
      "With 1,900 potential claimants, including cancer patients, survivors and families, lawyers say it is set to be the largest pharmaceutical product group action in English and Welsh legal history.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of women with gynaecological cancers - many are part of the group action - who believe their repeated use of talcum powder played a part in their diagnosis.",
      "Their lawyers allege that for decades, talcum powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos - something they claim J&J was aware of but sought to suppress.",
      "J&J denies suppressing any information and denies any links between its baby powder, asbestos and cancer.",
      "\"The doctors said the cancer was unusual for my age at 44,\" says Cassandra, from Alfreton in Derbyshire.",
      "She says she would regularly use talcum powder after a bath or as a deodoriser, including across her genitals.",
      "\"I was just starting my chemo journey when I read about the links, but I felt enraged that a corporate giant like J&J could seem to do this,\" she says.",
      "At first, doctors believed Cassandra's cancer was terminal.",
      "\"I went to the consultation alone,\" she says. \"So I had to come home and tell my husband what they said, tell my parents they would be burying me.",
      "\"I closed down my business unit and laid off staff.",
      "\"I even created a not-so-creative acronym: 'LAC - Life After Cass'.\"",
      "Then, she had an unexpected lifeline. Chemotherapy had in fact triggered an autoimmune condition, giving the impression of late-stage cancer.",
      "Cassandra survived. But the disease still had a devastating effect on her life.",
      "She was forced to give up her business, and an infection during chemotherapy damaged her vocal cords, reducing her voice to a whisper. A hysterectomy to remove cancerous tissue had a huge impact on her body.",
      "\"I was plunged into surgical menopause,\" she says.",
      "\"I would have liked children. I was never blessed that way, but my last ability to have children was taken away due to cancer.\"",
      "Are there links between talcum powder and cancer?",
      "The claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known carcinogen.",
      "Talc is a mineral that is sometimes used in talcum powders and other cosmetic products, according to Cancer Research UK.",
      "Sophia Lowes, from the charity, said: \"[Talc] can be mined in places where there is asbestos, which can cause the talc to become contaminated. Asbestos is known to cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary.",
      "\"The sale of products containing asbestos is banned in the UK and cosmetic products need to be safety-tested before they can be sold.\"",
      "Many documents were hidden from public view until Americans with cancer began suing the firm.",
      "J&J has been accused of knowing decades ago that its baby powder could contain contaminants of asbestos.",
      "J&J has previously said that \"any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false\".",
      "The company discontinued mineral-based talc in North America in 2020 - and followed suit in the UK last year - replacing it with cornstarch. J&J said this was due to financial pressures and a \"misinformation campaign\" around the product.",
      "While the focus of the group action is on the contamination of talc with asbestos, in July this year the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that mineral talc itself was \"probably carcinogenic for humans\".",
      "Deborah, who did not want to be identified by her real name, also lives in Derbyshire, and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 29, just two weeks after she and her husband had started trying for a baby.",
      "\"I used talcum powder for years as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "\"Literally all I had was some stabbing pain on a Sunday night. I went to the doctor and was sent for an ultrasound on the Tuesday.\"",
      "During the scan, a tumour was found on Deborah's ovary. A few days later she had an operation, at which point doctors told her there was a risk the cancer had spread to her womb.",
      "\"Within two weeks of the first symptoms, I'd had a full hysterectomy,\" she says.",
      "\"I went from excitedly planning for a baby to having all of my parts removed.\"",
      "Deborah's diagnosis was 30 years ago, and she and her husband ultimately went on to adopt.",
      "But she still feels angry that she was robbed of the chance to conceive naturally.",
      "\"If [J&J] knew, they shouldn't have been doing it,\" she says.",
      "KP Law, representing the claimants, has begun the process of litigation, which is expected to start at the beginning of 2025.",
      "In the US, the firm has been sued by more than 62,000 people and at least $13bn has been paid out or set aside in response to the action.",
      "Cases there have seen the company found liable for mesothelioma - an asbestos-specific cancer - and gynaecological cancers women suffered after using talc, with billions of dollars awarded in damages.",
      "'Entirely transparent'",
      "Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, says: \"The case has been litigated repeatedly in the American judicial system but women in the UK deserve an answer, and compensation, here.",
      "\"Asbestos cancers tend to have a latency of around 10 to 40 years. So we are walking into a wave of women reaching an age where asbestos cancers develop.\"",
      "Mr Longstaff's firm sent a pre-action letter to J&J in September, a necessary step before starting proceedings. If the case goes ahead, it would likely end up in court next year.",
      "In response, Erik Haas - worldwide vice-president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the allegations against the company \"defy logic, rewrite history and ignore the facts\".",
      "\"J&J takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has,\" he says.",
      "\"As our documents show, we have relied upon the most state-of-the-art testing protocols for decades and have been entirely transparent with government institutions and academic researchers regarding our findings.\"",
      "Mr Haas also said the idea that J&J hid the contaminated contents of its products from the public, government and other groups was \"inconceivable and false\".",

      "US President-elect Donald Trump will visit Scotland next year for the opening of a new golf course in Aberdeenshire, his son has confirmed.",
      "Eric Trump and his father broke ground on the 18-hole links MacLeod Course at the Trump International resort in Menie last year.",
      "The course is expected to open next summer. If the visit goes ahead, it could be the first time Donald Trump travels to Scotland since his victory in the US election.",

      "Thousands protest as Trump plays golf",
      "Trump says 'great to be home' on visit to Scotland",

      "The resort has prompted controversy in the past - four years ago the dunes at Menie lost their status as a nationally-important protected environment.",
      "But Trump International claimed the new course was \u201cone of the most environmentally friendly and sustainable\u201d ever built.",
      "The Scottish Greens previously said Trump and his new golf course were \"not welcome in Aberdeenshire\", accusing him of being a climate-change denier with a \"long history of lies and dodgy business dealings\".",
      "During his 2018 visit, Trump was booed during an afternoon game of golf by demonstrators gathered at the perimeter of the Turnberry complex.",
      "A paraglider was also able to fly over the resort hotel with a banner criticising Trump.",
      "Speaking to the PA news agency, Eric Trump said his family's \"love\" for Scotland kept them investing in the country.",
      "He said the Scottish government had made it \"virtually impossible\" to do business, saying \"[it's] very long to get permits, there are a lot of regulations, a lot of red tape, insane taxation, government leaders who just take pot shots at you for no reason whatsoever\".",
      "The businessman, Donald Trump's third child, said he had meticulously designed the refurbishment of the resort, including investing hundreds of millions of dollars into it, adding: \"And I've never really gotten so much as a thank you.\"",
      "Tariff warning",
      "He also said it was \"nasty\" for First Minister John Swinney to endorse Kamala Harris, but that his father \"is not going to lose any sleep\" over the remarks.",
      "Swinney sent a letter to Trump after his victory saying he wanted both countries to have a good relationship and wished him well.",
      "Eric Trump also suggested Swinney's original remarks could affect Scotland's ability to negotiate on tariffs - Donald Trump has vowed to tax all goods imported into the US if he returned to the White House.",
      "He added: \"And now, all of a sudden, you have two countries that could have the greatest political relationship.",
      "\"Again, my father adores Scotland, and you have a First Minister coming out and just being fairly nasty in the days leading up.",
      "\"I mean, who did that benefit? Did that benefit Scotland?",
      "\"You know, you just asked about tariffs? Does that benefit that? If he ever needs to call my father and ask about tariffs or negotiate a base, does that benefit Scotland?\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"The USA is Scotland\u2019s most important market and source of inward investment. The Scottish government greatly appreciates the strong and lasting social, cultural and economic ties we have with the United States.",
      "\"The first minister and his ministers will work to make sure these ties continue to flourish, consistent with the values that underpin Scotland and the United States.\""

    "story": [
      "An additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the winter fuel payment, the government's own estimates have revealed.",
      "Earlier this year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the \u00a3300 payment would be restricted to all but the poorest pensioners - those eligible for pension credit.",
      "In a bid to soften the impact of the cuts, the government launched a campaign to encourage eligible pensioners to apply for pension credit.",
      "In a letter clarifying the figures, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the estimates did not take into account any increased take-up of pension credit.",
      "According to the estimates provided by the government, in the years ending March 2025, March 2026 and March 2028 there will be an additional 50,000 pensioners in relative poverty after housing costs.",
      "In the years ending March 2027, March 2029 and March 2030 an additional 100,000 pensioners would be in relative poverty after housing costs.",
      "The annual figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000. Kendall said this meant \"small variations in the underlying numbers impacted can lead to much larger changes in the rounded headline numbers\".",

      "The new estimates, published on Tuesday, suggest the cuts to the winter fuel payment would increase pensioner poverty by 0.5 percentage points.",
      "A person is considered to be living in relative poverty if they have less than 60% of the median income.",
      "In her letter, Kendall said the work and pensions department had written to 120,000 pensioners to encourage them to claim the pension credit to which they may be entitled.",
      "She added that the decision to cut the winter fuel payment was \"not a decision this government wanted or expected to take\".",
      "\"However, we were forced to take difficult decisions to balance the books in light of the \u00a322bn black hole we inherited.",
      "\"Given the dire state of the public finances, it\u2019s right that we target support to those who need it most.\"",

      "\"Their winter fuel payment cuts are going to plunge 100,000 pensioners into poverty in the next few years.",
      "\"Clearly Keir Starmer feels like that's a price worth paying to make a political point. But I don't think those pensioners would agree with him.\"",

      "Tesco, Amazon, Greggs, Next and dozens of other chains are urging the Treasury to reconsider some of the measures.",
      "In a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, they said the \"cumulative burden\" of the Budget changes and other policies already in the pipeline will add billions in costs to a sector with a 3% to 5% profit margin.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said it had had to \"make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\", while one union called the letter \"pathetic\".",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the Treasury Committee on Tuesday he had seen the letter and it was \"right\" to say jobs could be affected.",

      "Measures in the Budget, in particular the employer NI increase, have been met with a tide of criticism from business, who argue it will hold back growth.",
      "But concerns have been loudest among retailers and hospitality businesses, where many young people find their first jobs. Firms in those sectors are also facing higher costs from next year's rise in the minimum wage.",
      "Though many individual retailers have already spoken out, this letter marks the first time so many have done so together.",

      "The government has defended its tax rises as necessary to avoid cuts to public services, and the rise in the minimum wage, with a bigger boost for younger workers and apprentices, has been welcomed by trades unions.",
      "The letter from the businesses belonging to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said: \"The sheer scale of new costs and the speed with which they occur create a cumulative burden that will make job losses inevitable, and higher prices a certainty.\"",
      "It calculated the changes would add over \u00a37bn a year in costs, adding it would \"not be possible to absorb such significant cost increases over such a short timescale\".",

      "He said all pensioners would receive the benefit \u2013 which is currently either \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 \u2013 without having to apply, but that better off Scots would pay some of the it back.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended his \"tough\" decision to cut winter fuel payments.",

      "However, the state pension increase will be spread over the year from next April, whereas the winter fuel payment is usually paid in November or December.",

      "There are a few elements at play when it comes to this announcement.",
      "For one thing, Anas Sarwar has always said he's uncomfortable with the UK Labour government's criteria around who gets a winter fuel payment. He thinks it's too restrictive.",
      "Also, after Keir Starmer's rough start upon entering Downing Street, he's perhaps made the calculation that a bit of distance between him and UK Labour is no bad thing.",
      "Indeed, in a huddle with press this morning, Sarwar was keen to stress areas where he's taken a different approach (such as joining workers on picket lines).",
      "Remember the context here: there's a Holyrood election in 2026, and Scottish Labour won't want to be associated with any UK Labour unpopularity around that time.",
      "Finally, there's a bit of a challenge to the Scottish government in all of this.",
      "As the budget approaches, there are rumblings that Scottish ministers could throw some extra cash towards pensioners.",
      "In the wake of today's announcement Anas Sarwar can claim he made the first move.",

    "summary": "The first in-person meeting since 2018 comes as the PM prioritises shoring up support for Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has met President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit, and emphasised the importance of a \"strong UK-China relationship\" for both countries.",
      "The meeting was the first time a UK prime minister has met the Chinese president in person since 2018, following a recent souring in relations.",
      "Sir Keir raised the case of the jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Jimmy Lai, saying he was concerned about reports of a \"deterioration\" in his health.",
      "The PM also signalled a desire for greater business co-operation, particularly on \"areas of mutual cooperation\" such as international stability, climate change and economic growth.",
      "Sir Keir met President Xi on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and, speaking at the start of the meeting, said: \"We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible.\"",
      "He added: \"The UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law.\"",
      "Speaking through a translator, Xi told Sir Keir that the two countries should commit to mutual respect and openness, saying: \"China and the UK have broad space for co-operation across various domains, including trade, investment, clean energy, financial services, healthcare and improving our peoples' well-being.\"",
      "A read-out of the closed door meeting said the PM set out the leaders' shared responsibility to work together in pursuit of global stability, economic co-operation and trade, and efforts to move away from fossil fuels to renewables.",
      "Climate change was a focus for the PM, and a Downing Street spokesperson said the PM wants China's support on global efforts, particularly in light of President-elect Trump's expected roll back of green policies.",
      "However, Sir Keir also stressed his government's approach would \"always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner\" to China.",
      "With China's military support for Russia's war in Ukraine having prompted criticism from the UK and other Western countries, the PM also said he wanted to \"engage honestly and frankly\" on areas of disagreement, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Their first meeting follows an initial phone conversation in August after Labour's election victory and Sir Keir has now proposed a full bilateral meeting in Beijing or London.",
      "The pair also agreed Chancellor Rachel Reeves should visit Beijing next year to discuss economic and financial cooperation with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.",
      "The Conservative's shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \u201cBritain's standing on the world stage risks being weakened if the prime minister does not robustly defend our national interest.\"",
      "She said constructive dialogue was important but that Sir Keir \"should have been stronger in raising our concerns over human rights, the repressive nature of the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong, and the security, safety and wellbeing of British nationals, like Jimmy Lai, who should be freed from custody\".",
      "\"Starmer must set out, as part of his supposed reset, what assurances he received from President Xi on the UK\u2019s areas of concern.\u201d",
      "Labour tiptoes nervously towards a China policy",
      "Honest talks needed, Starmer tells Chinese leader",
      "How long-range missiles striking Russia could affect Ukraine war",
      "Before the meeting in Brazil, the prime minister said it was important to engage with economies like China - and Foreign Secretary David Lammy held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as well as Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, in Beijing last month.",
      "The last British prime minister to meet President Xi was Theresa May, who hailed a \"golden era\" for UK-China relations during her 2018 visit to the country.",
      "But since then there have been tensions over issues including China's treatment of the Uyghur minority group in Xinjiang and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.",
      "Last year, then-Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said China was \"the biggest state-based threat to our economic security\".",
      "But like the current government, he also said it was necessary to engage with China on issues like climate change and the global economy.",
      "Dr Yu Jie, a China expert from the Chatham House international think tank, said the G20 meeting was \"critical\" for UK-China relations to thaw after a six-year freeze - and suggested there could be a trade deal in sight, despite significant diplomatic tensions.",
      "\"Judging from the readout given by both sides, the tone of the conversation seemed to be positive,\" said Dr Yu.",
      "\"But when they came to specifics it seems on the thorny issues they have not really reached any agreement at all.\"",
      "Dr Yu warned both sides' efforts could still be overshadowed by pressure from the US.",
      "\"That's something quite difficult for the British government, if the US is going to be adding extra pressure for the UK to be in line with the US on China policy,\" she said, describing how she expected the US policy towards China to be \"hawkish\" under Trump.",
      "Speaking to reporters on his way to the summit in Rio de Janeiro, Sir Keir also said \"shoring up support for Ukraine\" was top of his agenda.",
      "Before the meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister will urge other G20 nations to step up their support for Ukraine or face \"unfathomable consequences\" if Russia is allowed to be victorious.",
      "The summit follows large-scale missile and drone attacks by Russia across Ukraine over the weekend, and will take place as the conflict approaches its 1,000th day.",
      "And it comes amid reports that the US has authorised the use of long-range missiles it supplies to Ukraine to strike Russia.",
      "The weapons have so far only been used by Kyiv on Russian-occupied targets within its own territory.",
      "The UK has also supplied Ukraine with its Storm Shadow missiles and defence officials and ministers have been making the case for Kyiv to be permitted to use them to hit targets inside Russia. But they were not willing to act alone - and had been waiting for the White House to change its mind.",
      "Sir Keir said he was \"not going to get into operational details\" with regards to missiles in Ukraine.",
      "Sir Keir is holding talks with other G20 leaders, representing 19 of the world\u2019s largest economies and the African Union and the European Union.",
      "The summit is overshadowed by the absence of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trump has called for allies to take a more aggressive approach towards China and may trigger a global trade war if he imposes a promised 60% tariff on Chinese goods entering the US.",
      "This summit will provide world leaders a first chance to compare notes and prepare for Trump's upcoming return to the White House.",

    "story": [
      "It is the \"end of the party but not the movement\", Women's Equality Party co-founder Catherine Mayer has said, after members voted to shut down the organisation.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Woman's Hour, Mayer said the party was closing partly due to financial pressures but also because the party's approach \"was not working in a polarised world\".",
      "Co-founder Sandi Toksvig said they would now try to implement change through activism rather than spending money standing candidates in elections.",
      "She also denied the party's demise was linked to its stance on transgender issues, saying a fall in membership was due to women struggling to afford the members' fees during the cost of living crisis.",
      "The party was launched in 2015, following conversations between Mayer and Toksvig in which they shared their \"impatience with the slowness of change\" on women's issues.",
      "Mayer said they wanted to emulate the success of the UK Independence Party who had managed to change the Conservative Party's stance on the European Union by winning votes in their traditional heartlands at elections.",
      "\"We basically had a couple of beers that turned out to be very expensive,\" Mayer said.",
      "The party - initially led by journalist Sophie Walker - campaigned on closing the gender pay gap, making childcare more affordable and increasing the rate of prosecutions for domestic violence.",
      "Female rugby players say equality issues remain",
      "Feminist party's first leader resigns",
      "What does trans mean and what is the Cass review?",
      "In 2016, Walker came sixth in the London mayoral elections winning 2% of the vote.",
      "However, the party failed to build on its vote share and in the general election earlier this year, it stood four candidates and won just 1,275 votes.",
      "It had also received some criticism over its position on transgender rights.",
      "Journalist Suzanne Moore was involved in setting up the party in 2015, but in a recent article on Substack, said the party leaders had ignored the views of their own membership \"70% of whom did not support Self ID\".",
      "A self-ID system would allow someone to change their legal sex without a medical diagnosis.",
      "Currently, UK adults can get a gender recognition certificate if they meet certain criteria including a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.",
      "Defending their approach, Mayer said the party had been \"very clear\" and \"supported the right, from the beginning, for people to determine their own gender\".",
      "\"We also tried very, very hard to make space for all areas of opinion on this.\"",
      "Toksvig said: \"I couldn't be more trans-inclusive but I didn't want to shout at people.",
      "\"I don't want a polarised debate... what I wanted was a space where we could carry on having the discussion.\"",
      "Asked if the party's position on transgender rights had led to a drop in membership numbers, Mayer said they lost some members but also gained members and that overall it was \"net neutral if not slightly positive\".",
      "Toksvig said the cost of living crisis following the pandemic had led to an overall drop in funding.",
      "Last month, the party's leadership recommended to its members that they should vote to shut down the party and over the weekend, members voted by 78% to back the proposal.",
      "Toksvig said: \u201cIf the way that we get attention to the incredible issues \u2013 for example women\u2019s health care, affordable childcare \u2013 if that\u2019s through activism rather than through trying to stand candidates that we can\u2019t really afford in elections, then this is going to be the way forward.\u201d",
      "In 2024, the party raised \u00a39,000. In comparison Reform UK brought in \u00a34.3m and the Liberal Democrats raised around \u00a312m.",
      "\"What we have is a movement and what we are now looking at is how we transition that into more reforms and more effective activism,\" Mayer said.",
      "\"It's the end of the party, but not the movement.\"",
      "They said they would continue to back the party's four local councillors in Basingstoke, Cheshire and Dorset.",
      "\"We will be supporting them,\" said Toksvig, adding: \"What we won't be worried about is keeping the lights on.\""

      "The prime minister has said he will not put pressure on Labour MPs over their votes on whether to legalise assisted dying.",
      "Cabinet ministers are increasingly divided in public over the issue, which will be voted on in the House of Commons at the end of next week.",

      "The Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case, the country\u2019s most senior civil servant, had told all ministers they should \u201cnot take part in the public debate.\u201d",
      "Mr Streeting\u2019s repeated public opposition, including asking officials to examine the costs to the NHS of implementing any change in the law, has provoked private and public irritation from some of his Labour colleagues.",
      "One cabinet source said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to expect the health secretary not to give his view.",
      "On Friday morning, the prime minister and the health secretary spoke about it face-to-face, a conversation, one source told me, amounted to a telling off for Mr Streeting.",
      "Neither Downing Street nor the Department of Health deny the meeting took place, with another source insisting afterwards there was \u201cno outstanding issue\u201d between the two men.",
      "Those around the prime minister also acknowledge that it is reasonable that both the health secretary and the justice secretary would face more questions than most on the issue, given they would be responsible for implementing any change in the law.",
      "But the fact that both are opposed to such a change highlights the tensions this is causing within government \u2013 could either, realistically, implement such a colossal change, weighted with moral considerations, which they personally opposed?",
      "And what of the prime minister\u2019s position? And how awkward could it be if he finds himself on the losing side of the argument?",
      "It has provoked some pretty searching conversations at the top of government, I am told, about how best to handle it \u2013 to minimise the prospect of what some see as an \u201cunnecessary mess\".",
      "A free vote is rare at Westminster, but even with one politicians can never detach themselves entirely from party politics.",
      "Sir Keir has previously said he was in favour of a change in the law and has now told reporters \u201cI will be voting\u201d a week on Friday.",
      "Referring to his time as Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Keir said:",
      "\u201cPeople feel very strongly about this. And that's not a political divide. It's a sort of individual divide. I know this first hand because obviously I looked at every single assisted suicide case for five years that was investigated.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI also did the biggest consultation in criminal justice when we did the consultation on assisted dying. It was the biggest response, because people felt so strongly, and I could feel that, and I've always said getting the balance right is crucially important.\u201d",
      "Pointedly, he said he won't \u201csay or do anything that will put pressure on other people in relation to their vote,\u201d when asked whether he thought the health secretary had broken the understanding that the government should remain neutral on the issue."

      "On a spring day, Hamid Khoshsiar decided to make the perilous journey into the European Union. He was 31 at the time, an Iranian refugee who had been living in Turkey for two years. But in 2019, he felt it was time to go.",
      "Starting out in Igneada, in the north of the country, he walked along a slippery, uneven trail for half a day, through dense forest and sharp shrubbery in the direction of Bulgaria. Eventually he reached the border.",
      "His best option, he decided, was to swim across a small river. The waters were mercifully calm. Packing his scant belongings into plastic bags, he waded in.",
      "\u201cThere was so much adrenaline in my blood,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe only thing that was important to me was safety. All my mind was about that: am I going to find safety or not?\u201d",
      "It would take him 20 hours to reach safety in Bulgaria, where he now lives with refugee status. As for the journey, he says he could have died from dehydration had he not been found by a police patrol. Still, it was the best decision of his life.",
      "\u201cIt was worth it because I didn\u2019t have any other option. I was so lucky.\u201d",
      "Over the past five years, more and more migrants have decided to try their luck following the same path, known as the Eastern Mediterranean route. It starts in Turkey and moves into either Bulgaria or Greece; and then, for many, deeper in Europe.",
      "Whilst other routes - like the path from the north African coast to Italy - have seen a fall, the numbers entering Europe via this Eastern Mediterranean route tripled between 2021 and 2023 and is still rising, according to EU border agency Frontex.",
      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",
      "Since taking power, the Labour government has repeatedly promised to \u201csmash\u201d the smuggling gangs who lead them here.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",

      "Can you smash the gangs to stop the boats?",
      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",

With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",

      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "story": [
      "For years, the UK\u2019s relationship with China has been poor, dominated by rows about democracy in Hong Kong, human rights in Xinjiang and cyber threats against UK bodies.",

      "For his part, Mr Xi said there was \u201cbroad space\u201d for both countries to co-operate on trade and investment, clean energy and health care.",
      "The problem is all this could become otiose if Donald Trump imposes huge tariffs on Chinese imports and triggers a global trade war.",

      "That is why he wants Europe to spend more on its defence \u2013 so he can deploy US forces to the Pacific.",
      "And that is why Europeans are braced for fresh pressure from the US to adopt a tougher approach to China.",
      "Many in the US think the UK and the EU are trying to curry favour in Beijing by being less hostile than Washington.",
      "So the prime minister is trying to engage more closely with China, and at the very least be more consistent than his predecessors.",

    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",

      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",

      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:36:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:02:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget. Farmers have travelled to London and are taking part in a rally near Parliament to highlight their concerns.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "There have been different claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "These vary from as many as 70,000 to as few as 500.",
      "Where does the 70,000 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Country Land and Business Association whose president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "It was also used by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change.",
      "It is not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it is an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at the University of Reading, pointed to various sources, including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "Another way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Where does the 500 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Treasury, which says it expects 500 estates to be affected by the changes each year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value). The normal rate of inheritance tax is 40%.",
      "However, as Dan Neidle - founder of the independent Tax Policy Associates - points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is a \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it is  being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",

    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

      "The famous primatologist and conservationist settles into a high-backed chair that dwarfs her slender frame.",
      "On my screen I can see that behind her, on a shelf, is her toy monkey, Mr H.",
      "The toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend and has travelled the world with her. Dr Goodall is now 90 years of age, and she and Mr H are still travelling.",
      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",

      "They have also agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and to treble renewable power by 2030.",
      "But while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis.",
      "\"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories.

      "\u201cWe're not a part of those discussions,\u201d said Micahi Robertson who\u2019s an adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States at these talks.",
      "The letter has been prompted by growing concerns about some of the countries chosen to host COP talks and their ability to deliver a significant advance in the fight against rising temperatures.",
      "Just before the latest conference started, a secret recording showed the chief executive of Azerbaijan's COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, discussing \"investment opportunities\" in the state oil and gas company with a man posing as a potential investor.",

      "Host Geoff Keighley also revealed that the 3D platformer and the role-playing game had received seven nominations each, including Game of the Year.",
      "Card game Balatro, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Metaphor: Refantazio and Black Myth: Wukong are the other games up for the top prize.",

      "This action-adventure based on Journey to the West - a classic novel from Chinese Mythology - was a giant hit upon its release.",
      "It sold huge numbers in China, but also proved popular among Western fans too.",
      "Its inclusion on the Game of the Year shortlist might surprise some, as its critical reception was much less positive than the titles it's up against.",

      "The 2024 update is currently the best-reviewed title this year, bringing more of the exploration and brutally hard combat encounters fans have come to expect from developer From Software.",
      "But there's some disagreement over whether it counts as a true \"Game of the Year\".",
      "That's because Shadow of the Erdtree isn't a standalone game but downloadable content (DLC) that adds dozens of hours of content to the original game.",
      "The Game Awards allows expansions like this to be nominated in any category, but some have argued they shouldn't be eligible.",

      "\"As our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it,\" he said.",
      "Besides banning children from sending direct messages (DMs) across the platform, it will give parents more ways to easily see and manage their child's activity.",
      "Parents and guardians must verify their identity and age with a form of government-issued ID or a credit card in order to access parental permissions for their child, via their own linked account.",
      "But Mr Kaufman acknowledged identity verification is a challenge being faced by a lot of tech companies, and called on parents to make sure a child has the correct age on their account.",

      "By default, Roblox users under the age of nine will only be able to access \"minimal\" or \"mild\" experiences - but parents can allow them to play \"moderate\" games by giving consent.",

      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",

      "In the first few months of the war the front line moved quickly, with Russia gaining ground quickly before being pushed back by a Ukrainian counteroffensive. But in 2023 neither side made any major gains - with the conflict largely sliding into a stalemate.",
      "But new ISW figures suggest the story in 2024 is more favourable for Russia. The ISW bases its analysis on confirmed social media footage and reports of troop movements.",
      "The ISW data shows Moscow\u2019s forces have seized around 2,700 sq km of Ukrainian territory so far this year, compared with just 465 sq km in the whole of 2023, a near six-fold increase.",
      "Dr Marina Miron, a defence researcher at Kings College London, suggested to the BBC that there was a possibility the Ukrainian eastern front \u201cmight actually collapse\u201d if Russia continued to advance at pace.",
      "More than 1000 sq km was taken between 1 September and 3 November, suggesting the push accelerated in recent months. Two areas bearing the brunt of these advances are Kupiansk in Kharkiv region, and Kurakhove, a stepping stone to the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region.",
      "Kupiansk and areas to the east of the Oskil river were liberated in the Kharkiv offensive of 2022, but Russia has progressively retaken the latter area. In a recent intelligence update, the UK's Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were trying to breach the north-eastern outskirts of the city.",
      "Footage posted on 13 November and verified by the BBC is consistent with this analysis. The video shows a convoy of Russian armour being repelled after making it to within 4km of the key bridge at Kupiansk, the last major road crossing in the area.",
      "While these reports do not necessarily translate to control of an area, it is indicative of how stretched Ukraine\u2019s defensive line has become.",
      "Elsewhere, since retaking the city of Vuhledar in October - an elevated position which sits above key supply lines and which Moscow spent two years fighting for - Russia has thrown resources at Kurakhove.",

      "Despite the Russian advances, some experts have noted that the actual speed of the offensive is still slow. David Handelman, a military analyst, suggested Ukrainian troops in the east were slowly withdrawing to preserve manpower and resources, rather than suffering from a broader collapse.",

      "Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August. It is unclear why Russia took so long to respond to the operation, which saw Kyiv\u2019s troops quickly gain control over a number of border communities.",
      "Dr Miron suggested that while the Kremlin would suffer a domestic political cost for as long as the incursion continued, Russia\u2019s general staff had been keen to keep Ukraine\u2019s forces tied down in Kursk as its forces made gains elsewhere along the front line.",
      "But Moscow is now clearly intent on reclaiming the territory lost on its own soil. Some 50,000 troops have been deployed to the region.",
      "Verified videos from the Kursk region show fierce fighting is taking place - and that Russia is suffering considerable losses in terms of manpower and equipment. But the data clearly shows Ukraine\u2019s control of the region is shrinking.",

      "During an emotional day in court in Avignon, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's lawyers gave their closing arguments, describing the historic nature of the trial and paying tribute to her courage in waiving her anonymity to bring the mass rape trial into the open.",
      "In her statements to the court Caroline spoke of her anguish at what she says are persistent lies by her father.",

      "It was the last public exchange between a father and daughter who by all accounts had had, for many years, a loving and close relationship.",
      "Mr Pelicot recalled visiting her in hospital when she was recovering from surgery as a child so he could hold her and comfort her, and shared memories of her teenage years.",
      "When he repeated that he would always love her even if she had stopped loving him, she looked ahead silently, tears streaming down her face \u2013 but did not respond.",

      "Lawyers for the 50 other defendants will give their own closing arguments from next week. They are expected to explore more deeply the defence that many of the men cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her.",
      "Over almost three hours Ms Pelicot's lawyers, Antoine Camus and St\u00e9phane Babonneau, retold the horrific story of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s crimes, peppering their account with literary references.",
      "\"Everyone contributed to this monstrosity on their own level, and allowed a woman's ordeal to go on. It's the banality of evil of [philosopher] Hannah Arendt,\" said Mr Camus.",
      "They pleaded with the judges to hand down sentences that reflected the extent of the suffering of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and her family.",
      "Mr Camus said he was aware of the \u201cexpectations and hopes in this room and beyond\u201d for the trial, which he said he described as historic, because \u201cwe badly, urgently want and need it to be\".",
      "Leaning heavily on the notion of free will, he dismissed the defence\u2019s argument that many of the men who allegedly raped Ms Pelicot did so because they were intimidated, manipulated or tricked by her husband. \"Manipulation is not hypnosis,\" he said.",
      "The fact they were all aware that Mr Pelicot was \u201crecruiting\u201d many other men too should be taken into account by the judges, he added.",
      "\u201cEveryone who came into that house of horrors knew that others had come before him and others would follow,\u201d Mr Camus said.",
      "His colleague painted a devastating picture of Ms Pelicot\u2019s life since her husband\u2019s crimes had become known.",
      "St\u00e9phane Babonneau then described what had led Ms Pelicot \u2013 who by then was living in a small village under her maiden name \u2013 to give up her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "It was in 2023, he said, when French media began reporting on the Pelicot case  using pseudonyms that \u201ca feeling of rebellion started to take hold of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\".",
      "\"She decided to take back control of her life. The moment had come for shame to change sides.\u201d",
      "The will to stop hiding had awoken in her, he said, because she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. And she thought the details of her case and the videos of the alleged assaults would help expose the reality of rape.",
      "\u201cFor her story to be useful and to help other women she understood she had to give up the anonymity that had served her for years,\u201d Mr Babonneau explained. \u201cShe had to accept she would forever be the victim of the Mazan rapes.\u201d",
      "The lawyer also urged judges not to accept that the defendants had made a \u201cmistake\u201d when \u2013 as some have said \u2013 they raped Ms Pelicot involuntarily or \u201cout of stupidity or ignorance\u201d.",

      "\u201cI ask you to reject the right to make mistakes which would put society in danger \u2013 and at the risk of seeing more Gis\u00e8le Pelicots,\u201d Mr Babonneau said.",
      "He ended by paying tribute to Ms Pelicot and said the trial would be a \u201clegacy\u201d for future generations: \u201cThey will hear the name Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, they will hear about her courage and about the price she paid.\u201d",
      "Turning to look at Ms Pelicot, he said: \u201cYou did your job. You went beyond what was expected of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, pass on the torch to the others to carry on the fight you never chose.\u201d",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, to his right, wiped her eyes."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:10:49 GMT",
    "summary": "It marks a \"shocking and devastating development\" in the war, says Human Rights Watch.",
    "story": [
      "The US has been criticised by humanitarian organisations for deciding to supply Ukraine with landmines, as the war in eastern Europe rages on.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, Human Rights Watch director Mary Wareham said the decision marked a \"shocking and devastating development\" for those working to eradicate anti-personnel landmines.",
      "The approval from Washington is an attempt to slow down Russian troops, who have been steadily advancing into Ukraine's east in recent months.",
      "US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said they made their decision because of how Russia had changed its tactics on the battlefield - sending in troops first rather than \"mechanised forces\".",
      "Ms Wareham's stance was echoed by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which condemned the US decision \"in the strongest possible terms\".",
      "\"These horrific, indiscriminate weapons were banned by the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty given the devastating impact they have on civilians' lives and livelihoods,\" the statement from the ICBL's director, Tamar Gabelnick, added.",
      "Under the treaty, \"there are no circumstances under which Ukraine as a state party may acquire, stockpile or use them\", she added.",
      "Live: Ukraine uses UK-supplied missile to hit Russia",
      "Live: Ukraine uses UK-supplied missile to hit Russia",
      "The use of landmines is not illegal under international law. But more than 160 nations have signed the Mine Ban Treaty which commits to banning the production, use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines. Ukraine is a signatory to this treaty.",
      "However, after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine informed fellow signatories that its application of the treaty in the occupied areas would be is \"limited and is not guaranteed\".",
      "Ms Wareham from Human Rights Watch added: \"So much progress has been made over the past 25 years under the framework provided by the international treaty banning landmines. So it's just inconceivable that the US would take this step.\"",
      "Anti-personnel landmines are explosives which are often concealed on the ground and designed to detonate when people step over or near them.",
      "Russian forces have been using landmines widely in Ukraine - since it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia has deployed landmines to both defend their positions and slow down the Ukrainians.",
      "One of campaigners' main concerns in regards to landmines is the danger these weapons present to civilians, killing indiscriminately as they are buried underground or scattered on the surface.",
      "Another issue is the process of demining once a conflict is over, and clearing land that has been mined can take a long period of time. The process is also costly, with the World Bank reporting last year that demining Ukraine would cost $37.4bn (\u00a329.6bn).",
      "Austin said the US had sought reassurances of how the mines would be used.",
      "Washington expects that the mines - that officials say will be delivered soon -  would be used on Ukraine's territory, but away from densely-populated areas.",
      "Mr Austin said the US devices would be safer to use than the ones Ukraine were developing themselves, as the US mines are what it calls \"non-persistent\", meaning that after some days they lose charge and can no longer detonate.",
      "In reaction to Wednesday's news from Washington, the Halo Trust, the world's largest landmine clearing charity, said: \"The potential for further contagion of the use of anti-personnel (AP) landmines in eastern Europe is a clear and present danger\".",

      "A judge in Georgia found Jose Antonio Ibarra, an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, guilty of murder and other charges related to Ms Riley's death.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Ibarra killed the student on 22 February this year after going \u201chunting for females\u201d on the University of Georgia (UGA) campus.",
      "Ibarra\u2019s lawyers had argued that evidence linking him to Ms Riley\u2019s death was \u201ccircumstantial\u201d.",

      "Ms Riley, who lived in the city of Athens, north-east Georgia, was found dead in a wooded area of the UGA campus after she did not return from her morning run.",
      "Ibarra was arrested a day later.",
      "On Wednesday, he was found guilty of all 10 counts, including felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury and aggravated assault with intent to rape.",
      "Ibarra had waived his right to a jury trial, which means his case was heard and decided by county Judge Haggard.",
      "Prosecutors sought a life sentence without parole. Prosecutors told the court Ibarra saw Riley while she was running on the UGA campus and \"bashed her skull in with a rock\".",
      "Data from Ms Riley's smartwatch showed she had \"fought for her life, fought for her dignity\" only minutes after departing on her run, the trial heard.",
      "The victim's struggle was \"fierce\", the lead prosecutor said. Ms Riley called police at 09:11 that morning and her heart stopped at 09:28, with no more movement from her device.",
      "In their closing arguments, prosecutors outlined how evidence showed that Ibarra's DNA was found under the nails of Ms Riley, indicating that a struggle had ensued between them.",
      "Ibarra's lawyer, Dustin Kirby, argued that the evidence presented should leave the judge \"with some reasonable doubt\". He conceded that \u201cthe evidence in this case is very good that Laken Riley was murdered\", but he said proof connecting his client to Ms Riley's death was \"lacking\u201d.",
      "The trial, which began on Friday, included testimony from more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Ms Riley's former roommate and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra.",
      "Rosbeli Flores-Bello, Ibarra's former roommate, testified that the two had travelled together from New York City, where they had been living in a migrant shelter, to Georgia in search of work.",
      "Ibarra entered the US illegally on 8 September 2022, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was later released for further processing.",
      "ICE has said that Ibarra was arrested in New York City in September 2023 and was charged with \"acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation\".",
      "He was released by the NYPD \"before a detainer could be issued\", ICE officials said.",
      "Ms Riley's name became a rallying cry for conservatives as border security emerged as a defining issue in the White House race.",
      "In March, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was heckled over Ms Riley's murder during his State of the Union address.",
      "Republican lawmakers blamed the Biden-Harris administration for Ms Riley's death. They said it was the fault of the White House that Ibarra, who entered the US unlawfully in 2022, was able to remain in the country despite his criminal record.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, often invoked Ms Riley's name on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump reacted to Ibarra's guilty verdict, writing on Truth Social that he hopes the outcome of the trial \"can bring some peace and closure to her wonderful family who fought for justice\".",
      "\"It is time to secure our border,\" Trump added.",

      "The 76-year-old founder of the now-defunct Hong Kong tabloid Apple Daily has been accused of colluding with foreign forces.",
      "But Lai told the court on Wednesday that he had \"never\" used his foreign contacts, which include ex-US VP Mike Pence and former Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen, to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong.",
      "Lai is already serving prison sentences for a range of offences for his alleged role in pro-democracy protests in 2019, which led to China imposing a sweeping national security law (NSL) in the city.",

      "A similar crowd had gathered on Tuesday for the sentencing of the Hong Kong 47, which included some of the biggest names in Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement, like Benny Tai and Joshua Wong.",
      "When asked if he had tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong through his list of overseas contacts - which include the likes of former Taiwan president Tsai and high level US officials - Lai replied \"never\".",
      "Asked about his meeting with then US Vice President Mike Pence, Lai said he did not ask anything of him.",
      "\"I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me,\" he told the court.",

      "Logan Paul, the massively popular social media personality, is facing fresh questions over his cryptocurrency dealings amid ongoing concerns he may have profited from misleading fans.",
      "The BBC has seen new evidence suggesting he promoted investments without revealing he had a financial interest in them.",

      "Paul also currently faces a multi-million-dollar lawsuit over a failed crypto project called CryptoZoo.",
      "He denies any wrongdoing.",
      "The BBC has discovered that shortly before Paul tweeted about a particular crypto coin in 2021, an anonymous crypto wallet with close connections to his public wallet had traded in the coin.",
      "That anonymous wallet went on to make a $120,000 (\u00a392,000) profit.",
      "Crypto wallets (which can be physical devices or an online service) hold users' keys to their accounts, and let people send, receive and spend crypto.",
      "Our finding comes after Time Magazine reported similar activity involving a different cryptocurrency and another anonymous wallet.",
      "For several months, Paul refused to talk to the BBC about our investigation. Then he appeared to relent, inviting us to interview him at his gym in Puerto Rico.",
      "However, when our crew arrived, a Logan Paul lookalike turned up in the YouTuber\u2019s place, shortly followed by a crowd shouting abuse about the BBC.",

      "About three years ago, Paul\u2019s videos began mentioning cryptocurrency (crypto, as it is commonly known) more and more.",
      "Crypto is a form of digital money that uses secure technology to work, without the need for a central bank.",
      "In 2021, Paul promoted a series of extremely high-risk crypto tokens called \u201cmeme coins\u201d.",
      "These are usually inspired by internet jokes or memes and are supported by online communities. Meme coins have no other real purpose other than to be traded and, since they have no intrinsic worth, their value can - and often does - drop to zero.",
      "Paul extolled the virtues of an Elon Musk-themed meme coin known as Elongate. \u201cElongate made me rich. Elon baby let\u2019s go!\u201d Paul announced in a video clip to Maverick Club, his subscription-only fan club.",
      "Following this namecheck, the price of Elongate rose by over 6,000% to an all-time high. It then remained at that price for a few hours before it crashed.",
      "We cannot be sure of Logan Paul\u2019s intentions when he released his clip. However, it seems likely that his mention of Elongate affected its price.",
      "Tech journalist Will Gotsegen says crypto is a market driven to some extent by social media and influencers: \u201cA big guy with a lot of influence... someone like Logan Paul, buys a tonne of crypto and tells their followers about it. They're going to buy it too.\u201d",
      "The anonymous crypto wallet analysed by the BBC appears to have close connections to Paul.",
      "Anyone can see the transactions made by a wallet, but the owner can choose to remain anonymous. If an owner attaches their name or personal details it becomes a public wallet.",
      "We could see that the wallet first received funds in February 2021 from a public wallet owned by Logan Paul. It then started buying and trading crypto.",
      "Logan Paul: Bad Influence?",
      "Logan Paul, one of the biggest social media influencers in the world, is facing criticism for his role in promoting cryptocurrency projects. Matt Shea investigates the allegations.",

      "Watch on BBC Three at 21:00, 20 November or on BBC iPlayer shortly after broadcast",
      "The wallet was later paid funds from Maverick Club and held Elongate when Paul promoted it on 10 May 2021.",
      "Shortly after, it also traded in another Musk-related meme coin - after Paul had tweeted that it was headed \u201cto the moon\u201d.  In the crypto community, this means someone believes the price of the coin is about to shoot up.",
      "About an hour before Paul\u2019s tweet, the unknown wallet purchased almost $160,000 (\u00a3123,000) worth of the token. The tweet prompted an influx of buyers, spiking the price.",
      "Twelve hours later, the wallet sold most of its holding. The total profit made from this trade appears to be just over $120,000 (\u00a392,000).",
      "Logan Paul chose not to respond to the BBC\u2019s allegations regarding the crypto wallet, the trading that occurred within it, or his connection to it, despite responding to some of our other requests via his legal team.",
      "Dink Doink",
      "In June 2021, Paul also promoted a meme coin called \u201cDink Doink\u201d.",
      "Anyone who bought it would own shares in a cartoon character that resembled a metal coil. They would earn a portion of its earnings if it appeared in a TV show or film.",
      "Paul promoted the token on Twitter (as the site was then known), and told a Telegram group dedicated to Dink Doink that he \u201cbelieved\u201d in it, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go crazy.\u201d",
      "Again, this led to a huge influx of buyers, causing Dink Doink's value to spike. Then - following a familiar pattern - large-scale holders of the token began selling, causing its price to fall by 96% in just two weeks.",
      "Time Magazine analysed another anonymous wallet that had bought Dink Doink prior to Logan Paul\u2019s promotion of the coin and then sold its holding shortly after. This wallet later sent $100,000 (\u00a378,000) to Paul\u2019s public wallet.",
      "When the BBC asked the influencer about this wallet, his lawyers did not deny that it belonged to him, or was held for his benefit, but were adamant that the $100,000 that was transferred was not related to Dink Doink.",
      "They do accept that Paul traded Dink Doink, but say he only made $17,000 (\u00a313,400).",
      "Puerto Rico",
      "For several months, Paul refused to be interviewed by the BBC.",
      "Then, unexpectedly, he agreed to talk to us at the boxing gym in Puerto Rico that he co-owns with his brother.",
      "We sent Paul a list of the allegations we wanted him to respond to, and his PR team requested we travel to the Caribbean island, so he could answer in person.",
      "They also insisted we flew into the island while it was being pummeled by Tropical Storm Ernesto, which had knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "At the gym, we noticed a strange atmosphere - with a suspicious number of his own cameras pointed at us. Paul\u2019s assistant insisted our cameras should be recording from the moment the star entered the room, because of his strict schedule and timekeeping.",
      "Then things became even stranger. Instead of Logan Paul, a lookalike arrived and sat down in front of our reporter, Matt Shea, and began impersonating the YouTuber.",
      "We called him out and began complaining to Paul\u2019s assistant, asking whether the real Logan Paul would be coming. At that moment, a group of people suddenly appeared, apparently from nowhere, wielding banners and shouting that the BBC were \u201cpaedophiles\u201d.",
      "We had flown all that way just to be trolled.",
      "In the past few years, a number of celebrities have run into legal trouble for promoting crypto to followers without disclosing that they had vested interests.",
      "Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m (\u00a31m) in 2022 for promoting a token called EthereumMax on her Instagram account.",
      "According to Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the body policing the US investment industry, if a celebrity is promoting a particular crypto token, they are \u201csupposed to tell you if they get paid, how much they get paid, whether they own the tokens, whether they made money on the tokens, whether they actually know something about the project\u201d.",
      "CryptoZoo",
      "Logan Paul is now facing a lawsuit concerning his next venture in crypto - CryptoZoo.",
      "This was marketed as an online trading card game, but instead of cards, CryptoZoo was to use NFTs (non-fungible tokens) - collectible pieces of digital art that can have a value of their own.",
      "To play CryptoZoo, it was necessary to buy a cryptocurrency called Zoo Token, that could then be used to buy NFT \u201ceggs\u201d.",
      "These eggs were supposed to eventually hatch into NFT \u201canimals\u201d that would breed and give birth to NFT \u201chybrid animals\u201d with names like penguin-shark and panda-fin.",

      "\u201cAfter a certain point, you start to realise that something\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "The value of the Zoo Tokens and the eggs started to plummet. Rueben says he personally lost \u00a333,000.",
      "At least 130 investors are now involved in a lawsuit against Paul (Rueben is not one of them).  They claim they lost about $4.2m (\u00a33.25m).",
      "The lawyer behind the claim, Tom Kherkher - himself a popular YouTuber on legal affairs - says the failure to deliver the game forms only part of the case.",
      "He says leaked messages reveal Paul and his team were involved in a \u201cstealth launch\u201d of the Zoo Tokens, allowing them to quietly buy in at a low price.",
      "\u201cThe team appeared to agree that they can begin selling once the total value of all the Zoo Token in circulation hits $200m [\u00a3157m],\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIf you had that document with that exact verbiage issued by a CEO of a publicly traded company, they would be charged with fraud in two seconds. That is insider trading.\u201d",
      "Paul has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing relating to CryptoZoo. Instead, he has laid the blame on other members of the team whom he also says failed to deliver the promised features.",
      "Earlier this year, Paul announced a partial compensation scheme for disappointed investors. He promised to refund people who had bought the NFT eggs, but only if they agreed not sue him for anything relating to CryptoZoo.",
      "Paul is also bringing a libel claim against one of his online detractors in the USA, for claims made about his motives.",
      "Logan Paul\u2019s immense popularity depends on his fans, and shows little sign of declining.",
      "In recent years, Paul has turned his hand to boxing and wrestling, as well as launching the drinks company Prime, with British influencer KSI.",
      "The product became notorious for its viral launch - with only a limited stocks made available, Prime spawned a re-sale market with bottles being advertised for hundreds of pounds. It was a testament to both Logan Paul and KSI\u2019s influence over their primarily young audience.",
      "However, for at least one fan, his image has been tarnished for good.",
      "\u201cOnce you listen to someone and trust what they\u2019re saying and they betray that trust,\u201d says Rueben Tauk, \u201ctheir words don\u2019t mean anything to you any more.\u201d",

      "Church officials launched an investigation after the October 2023 music video release for Carpenter's hit song Feather, filmed inside the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.",
      "The Diocese said the investigation found other instances of mismanagement  beyond the music video that appalled some, including unapproved financial transfers.",
      "\"I am saddened to share that investigations conducted by Alvarez & Marsal and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP have uncovered evidence of serious violations of Diocesan policies and protocols,\" Bishop Robert Brennan said in the statement, according to the BBC's media partner CBS News.",
      "A replacement was installed and Mr Gigantiello was removed from his responsibilities, the statement read.",

      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",

But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",

      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",

      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",

      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",

      "Though some of the Republican president-elect's personnel decisions are immediate, many must go through further vetting.",
      "Several of the posts require a Senate hearing and a majority of the chamber's approval.",
      "But Trump is reportedly looking into a clause in the US Constitution that allows a president to unilaterally appoint nominees if the Senate is not in session.",
      "Senate vetting: How does it work?",
      "More than 1,000 positions - including the 15 officials chosen to lead executive departments, known as the Cabinet - typically require Senate approval. This also includes ambassadors and even some lower-level positions.",
      "But many members of Trump's team, including those who work in the White House or posts like the national security adviser, don't require Senate approval. They still are vetted, however, by the administration and could face intensive FBI background checks.",
      "On Thursday, incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Fox News that he does not anticipate a smooth road for each nominee.",
      "'None of this is gonna be easy,' he said.",
      "The FBI says members who are subject to vetting include presidential appointees, White House staff, positions requiring Senate confirmation, and other national security positions requiring security clearance.",
      "The FBI says it \"does not adjudicate or render an opinion on the results of the background investigation\", which are then sent to the office of the president-elect or the office of White House Counsel for their use \"as deemed appropriate\".",
      "It also is responsible for focusing \"on character and conduct\" and completing its investigation \"as expeditiously as possible.\"",

      "The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee.",
      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",
      "Bitter political brawls over Trump's picks could be limited somewhat because Republicans will control both chambers of Congress when the president-elect takes office in January.",
      "But some Republicans already have questioned at least one Trump choice, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, the nominee for post of attorney general, or top prosecutor in the US.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "The vetting and approval process for nominees can be lengthy, but it was included in the US Constitution to provide a check on presidential power. It is also designed to rule out corrupt or unqualified nominees.",
      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",
      "Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations.",
      "George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).",
      "This method of getting nominees into office was virtually stopped after the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in 2014, striking down multiple recess appointments and calling them unconstitutional.",

      "While other presidents have used them, Prof Chafetz says: \"I can't think of an instance in which the Senate majority has triggered a recess simply so that a president could make recess appointments.\"",
      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Professor Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 05:59:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Harvesting olives is an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but it is increasingly precarious.",
    "story": [
      "On a Thursday afternoon towards the end of last month, a 59-year-old Palestinian woman set out to gather olives on her family\u2019s land near the village of Faqqua, in the north of the occupied West Bank.",
      "It was something that Hanan Abu Salameh had done for decades.",
      "Within minutes, the mother of seven and grandmother of 14 lay dying in the dust of the olive grove, with a bullet wound in her chest - she\u2019d been shot by an Israeli soldier.",
      "Even though the family had co-ordinated their intention to pick olives with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to her son Fares and husband Hossam, the soldier fired several shots as other family members fled for cover.",
      "The IDF says it\u2019s investigating the incident, but Hanan\u2019s grieving relatives have little hope or expectation that her killer will be brought to justice.",
      "This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident.",
      "Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently",
      "Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers torch West Bank village",
      "Harvesting olives is an age-old ritual and also an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but, according to the UN, it is increasingly precarious.",
      "Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks, like organised attacks by Israeli settlers seeking to sabotage the olive harvest, along with the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.",
      "\u201cLast year we couldn\u2019t even harvest our olives, except for a very small amount,\u201d says Omar Tanatara, a farmer from the village of Umm Safa.",
      "\u201cAt one point, the army came, threw the olives we\u2019d already gathered on the ground, and ordered us to go home,\u201d says Omar, who is also a member of the village council.",
      "\u201cSome people were even shot at and olives trees were cut down with saws \u2013 that\u2019s how we later found them,\u201d adds Omar, as he and other villagers use small hand-held rakes to pull this year\u2019s harvest from their remaining trees while they can.",
      "Even when Israeli and international activists accompany villagers to their olive groves, hoping to deter the threat, there\u2019s no guarantee of safety.",
      "Zuraya Hadad instinctively winces as we watch a video of the incident in which her ribs were broken by a masked man wielding a large stick.",
      "The Israeli peace activist had been helping Palestinian farmers pick their olives when she was assaulted without provocation.",
      "Rather than arresting her attacker, Israeli soldiers, who\u2019d accompanied settlers to the site, just told him to move on.",
      "\u201cEven when we come to help, it doesn't guarantee that the Palestinians can harvest their olives,\u201d Zuraya tells me as she recovers from her injuries at home.",
      "\u201cWe try to raise awareness, but in the end it's either the settlers steal the olives or cut the trees, or they remain unpicked and go to waste.\u201d",
      "Land is at the heart of the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians - who controls it and who has access to it.",
      "For thousands of Palestinian families and villages, cultivating and harvesting olives is a big part of their economy.",
      "But many say that, in recent times, access to trees on their land has been impeded, often violently by Israeli settlers.",
      "Hundreds of trees - which can take years to reach fruit-bearing maturity - have been deliberately burned or cut down, says the UN.",
      "More than 96,000 dunums (approximately 96 sq km; 37 sq miles) of olive groves in the West Bank also went uncultivated in 2023 because of Israeli restrictions on access for Palestinian farmers.",
      "After being gathered by hand, villagers from Umm Safa take sacks full of olives to the nearby factory, where the presses have restarted this season.",
      "Olives are the most important agricultural product in the West Bank. In a good year, they're worth more than $70m (\u00a354m) to the Palestinian economy.",
      "But income was well down last year and this year will be even worse, says factory owner Abd al-Rahman Khalifa, as even fewer farmers are able to harvest their crop owing to attacks by settlers.",
      "\u201cLet me give you an example,\u201d he tells me.",
      "\u201cMy brother-in-law in Lubban - next to the Israeli settlement - went to pick his own olives, but they broke his arms and they made him leave along with everyone who was with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe, as Palestinians, don\u2019t have petrol or big companies. Our main agricultural crop is olives,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo, like the Gulf depends on oil, and the Americans on business, our economy is dependent on the olive tree.\u201d",
      "On the hill overlooking the olive groves of Umm Safa stands an illegal settler outpost - a farm.",
      "The extremist settler who runs it, Zvi Bar Yosef, was sanctioned this year by the UK and other Western governments for repeated acts of violence against Palestinians, including twice threatening families at gunpoint.",
      "Over the last year of the war in Gaza, Jewish settlers have been emboldened by the support of far-right Israeli ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir.",
      "As national security minister, he has given out free firearms to hundreds of settlers and has encouraged them to assert their right to what - they say - is their \"God-given\" land.",
      "Ben-Gvir has also been accused of openly supporting the disruption of olive harvesting on Palestinian land.",
      "At the olive press, farmers wait patiently in the yard to witness the transformation of the olives they\u2019ve been able to gather this year into \"liquid gold\".",
      "The olive tree has been a symbol of this land for centuries.",
      "For generations of Palestinians, it is their link to the land - a link that is under threat now more than ever."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:05:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Mahama's colourful story involves a historic coup, a stay in Moscow and a surprise dancehall hit.",
    "story": [
      "John Dramani Mahama has been Ghana's president once before - and now he is back for another punt at the top job.",
      "The 65-year-old led Ghana from 2012 to 2017 and is one of the West African country's most experienced politicians. He has served at all levels of office, as an MP, deputy minister, minister, vice-president and president.",
      "Long before it became a career, politics played a significant role in Mahama's childhood. When Mahama was just seven, his father, a government minister, was jailed during a military coup and later went into exile.",
      "Personal trials like this appear in Mahama's acclaimed writing - he has been published by a number of international news outlets and his memoir, My First Coup D'etat, won praise from two African literary greats, Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Chinua Achebe.",
      "When penning his manifesto for this year's elections, Mahama told voters Ghana \"is headed in the wrong direction and needs to be rescued\".",
      "But critics argue he may not be the right man for the job, given that his administration was hit by economic problems and a string of corruption scandals.",
      "Mahama's journey began in 1958, when he was born in the northern town of Damongo. After a few years he moved to the capital, Accra, to live with his father, Emmanuel Adama Mahama.",
      "In My First Coup d'Etat, Mahama Jr describes himself as \"an observant child with an active imagination and an unbounded curiosity\".",
      "He was also relatively privileged. The family had another home in the town of Bole, which at the time was not on the national grid. Mahama's parents were able to invest in a diesel generator for their six-bedroom house, meaning theirs was the only house in the town with lights.",
      "Local residents would gather outside the house when night fell, captivated by the curious orange glow.",
      "The future president attended Achimota boarding school, a prestigious institution known for educating heads of state like Ghana's Jerry John Rawlings, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first prime minister after it gained independence from the UK.",
      "It was at Achimota, in 1966, that Mahama heard there had been a coup. Military and police personnel had stormed Ghana's government buildings, seizing power from Nkrumah, who was away on a foreign trip.",
      "As updates trickled in, Mahama became increasingly anxious - he had heard no word from his father. Seven-year-old Mahama feared his father had been killed because of his proximity to Nkrumah.",
      "It turned out his father had been imprisoned - he would remain in jail for approximately a year.",
      "In 1981, after a second military coup, Mahama's father fled the country for Nigeria.",
      "Meanwhile, Mahama spent his twenties and thirties studying - he got a Communication Studies degree from the University of Ghana before studying at Moscow's Institute of Social Sciences.",
      "Mahama noted that his stay in Russia, then part of the Soviet Union, alerted him to \"the imperfections of the socialist system\".",
      "After returning to Ghana in 1996, Mahama followed his father's footsteps into politics.",
      "He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party and from there, scaled the political ranks. He zeroed in on the NDC's messaging, taking up roles as the parliamentary spokesperson and minister for communication.",
      "In 13 years, Mahama worked his way up to become vice-president, second-in-command under President John Atta Mills.",
      "But after just three years in office, Mills died unexpectedly at the age of 68.",
      "Just hours after this tragedy, a 58-year-old Mahama was sworn in as president. In his speech, Mahama described the day as the \"saddest\" in Ghana's history.",
      "General elections were held later that year and voters chose to keep Mahama in office.",
      "So what kind of leader is Mahama? Franklin Cudjoe, a Ghanaian political commentator and head of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, told the BBC the former president was an \"excellent communicator\".",
      "While political scientist Dr Clement Sefa-Nyarko described Mahama as a \"pragmatist\".",
      "Mahama has the it-factor but only in a climate where \"politics is driven by reality and intelligent communication\", said Dr Sefa-Nyarko, who lectures on African leadership at King's College London.",
      "But in contemporary Ghana, many voters are captivated by overambitious pledges, according to Dr Clement Sefa-Nyarko, which means pragmatic Mahama is \"not able to charm the populace much\".",

      "Gold, prices, and jobs: What's at stake in Ghana's elections?",
      "When campaigning to stay in power ahead of the 2016 elections, Mahama highlighted various infrastructure projects completed under his administration, such as those in the transportation, health, and education sectors.",
      "But under his watch, Ghanaians also experienced an ailing economy and widespread power cuts. Mahama was nicknamed \"Mr Dumsor\" in reference to the blackouts - \"dum\" means off and \"sor\" means on in the local Twi language.",
      "His term was also blighted by corruption scandals. For instance, a UK court found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015 - but Ghana's Office of the Special Prosecutor concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "There are \"lingering issues\" surrounding these graft scandals - ones that the current electorate will \"remember\", Mr Cudjoe said.",
      "But he also points out that, according to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), corruption became worse under Nana Akufo-Addo, who beat Mahama in the 2016 elections.",
      "Ghana averaged 45.8 under Mahama but dropped to 42 under Akufo-Addo in the CPI ranking where zero equates to \"highly corrupt\" and 100 is \"very clean\".",
      "Mahama attempted to win his old job back in 2020, but lost out to Akufo-Addo once again.",
      "Despite these defeats, Mahama has remained in the political sphere - he is currently leader of the opposition.",
      "He also enjoys a busy life away from politics - he has seven children and spends time with his wife, Lordina.",
      "Mahama is also a prolific writer. Asides from his memoir, he has written for media outlets like The New York Times, leading African-American magazine Ebony and Ghana's state-owned Daily Graphic.",
      "Mahama has also expressed his passion for music, saying Nigerian Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti helped him form \"political consciousness\" and that Michael Jackson is \"one of the greatest artistes that ever lived\".",
      "And in a full-circle moment, the former president was immortalised in Mahama Paper, a song by Ghanaian dancehall star Shatta Wale. Wale said the title was a reference to the Ghanaian banknotes printed during Mahama's administration.",
      "Naturally, Mahama has used the hit in his current campaign, pointing out that under  Akufo-Addo, Ghana has plummeted into its worst economic crisis in years.",
      "He has also been reminding Ghanaians of his extensive political experience but the fact remains - he was voted out of power once before as the public felt his performance wasn't good enough.",
      "Mahama is seeking to persuade voters this time will be different - a communications whizz hoping his message is clear enough to win him a second chance in Ghana's highest office.",

      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",

      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",

      "Independence had come with the painful partition that created Pakistan, sparking one of history's largest and bloodiest migrations. Amidst this chaos and as millions crossed borders, religious violence spread with Hindus and Sikhs on one side, and Muslims on the other. India's 16-member cricket squad - selected months earlier -  also had to deal with both personal and national turmoil as they readied themselves for a landmark series.",
      "Anthony De Mello, the president of Board of Control for Cricket in India, announced the team with a backdrop of a map of undivided India, proclaiming that the team would represent all of India.",
      "Until then, the Indian cricket team \u2013 known as \"All India\" \u2013 had only toured three times for official Test matches to England between 1932 and 1946, losing the series on every occasion.",
      "But in 1946 future Australian captain Lindsay Hassett brought an Australian Services team to India to celebrate the Allies\u2019 victory in World War Two. India won the unofficial series of three matches 1-0 and Hassett reported back to the Australian cricket authorities that the Indians were worthy of an official Test series.",
      "Excitement and anticipation ran high in Indian cricket circles as the team was expected to face the mighty Australians, led by legendary batsman Donald Bradman. His team was later dubbed \"Bradman's Invincibles\" after returning undefeated from England in 1948.",
      "De Mello\u2019s India squad was led by ace opening batsman Vijay Merchant, with his reliable partner Mushtaq Ali serving as deputy.",
      "Both had been exceptional on the English tours of 1936 and 1946, cementing their leadership roles. The squad also boasted elegant batter Rusi Modi and promising debutant fast bowler Fazal Mahmood, adding a dynamic mix of experience and fresh talent.",
      "But both Merchant and Modi withdrew from the tour on medical grounds. Ali also withdrew following the death of his elder brother, leaving him with family responsibilities.",
      "As a result, Lala Amarnath was announced as the new captain and Vijay Hazare his deputy.",
      "However, the violence that erupted following partition nearly prevented Amarnath from reaching Australia. According to a 2004 biography by his son Rajender Amarnath, Lala Amarnath narrowly escaped a sectarian mob in Patiala in Indian Punjab. His home in Lahore, now in Pakistan, along with its priceless artefacts, was lost forever.",
      "He also encountered danger during a train journey to Delhi.",
      "At a station in Indian Punjab, a police official recognised Amarnath and gave him a kada - a steel bangle worn by Sikhs and many Hindus as a religious symbol. Later, a mob at the station spared the cricketer because of the kada - it probably led them to believe he shared their faith.",
      "On the other side of the religious divide, pace bowler Mahmood found himself facing a deadly mob on a train.",
      "The team had scheduled two weeks of training in Pune (then Poona) from 15 August - though it was not known then, that was the day India was partitioned.",
      "Despite restrictions, Mahmood reached Poona for the training camp. Afterwards, he travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai) en route to Lahore. He writes in his 2003 autobiography that on the train, two men threatened him, but former Indian captain CK Nayudu intervened, bat in hand, and warned them off.",
      "Once he reached curfew-bound Lahore, Mahmood was horrified by the bloodshed he witnessed there and decided to stay back in Pakistan and not tour Australia. He later became part of the Pakistani cricket team and made his Test debut in 1952-53 against India.",
      "Two other members of India\u2019s squad for the Australia tour \u2013 Gul Mohammad and Amir Elahi \u2013 also later moved to Pakistan and played against India in the 1952-53 series.",
      "Despite these setbacks, India\u2019s tour went ahead, though a weakened India faced Australia without four of its leading players and lost the series 4-0.",
      "The two countries now play each other almost every two years. The miracle, however, is that the inaugural tour of 1947-48 happened at all, given the tumult at home.",

      "They were charged in 2021 under a controversial national security law (NSL) imposed by China. On Tuesday a court in Hong Kong sentenced 45 of them to jail terms ranging from four to 10 years. Two defendants were acquitted earlier in the year.",
      "Officials accused the eight women and 39 men of trying to overthrow the government by running an unofficial primary to pick opposition candidates for local elections. Most of the defendants either pleaded guilty or were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion.",
      "Some are famous figures like Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, icons of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong.",
      "There are also well-known opposition lawmakers Claudia Mo, Helena Wong,  Kwok ka-ki and Leung Kwok-hung who is also known as Long Hair.",
      "But many like Owen Chow, Ventus Lau and Tiffany Yuen represented a new  generation of vocal activists. Mr Lau and Mr Chow were among hundreds who stormed LegCo and spray-painted Hong Kong's emblem in what became a pivotal moment in the 2019 protests.",
      "What is Hong Kong's tough new security law?",
      "Then there are those who were not involved in politics but were galvanised by the 2019 protests - social workers like Hendrick Lui, entrepreneurs like Mike Lam and a former nurse, Winnie Yu.",
      "Most of the defendants have been in jail since the arrests in early 2021, as pre-trial detentions have become the norm under the NSL.",
      "Laurence Lau, a barrister and former district councillor, and Lee Yue-shun, also a former district councillor, were acquitted in May.",
      "The professor - Benny Tai",
      "One of the main organisers of the 2020 primary, Tai has been labelled by China as a \u201chardcore troublemaker\u201d for allegedly advocating Hong Kong independence and describing the Communist Party\u2019s rule as a \u201cdictatorship\u201d.",
      "A scholar and law professor, Tai first rose to prominence in 2014 when he founded the pro-democracy Occupy Central movement along with two others.",
      "It was a historic civil disobedience campaign that called for fair and free elections in Hong Kong, and saw hundreds of thousands take to the streets.",
      "In 2019, Tai was sentenced to prison for his role in the Occupy Central protests.",
      "A year later, after the NSL was imposed, he was fired from his tenured job at the prestigious University of Hong Kong (HKU) over his criminal conviction.",
      "Tai accused the university of bowing to Chinese pressure and called it the \u201cend of academic freedom\u201d in the city.",
      "By then, he was already facing accusations of subversion under the NSL for organising the primary.",
      "He has been sentenced to 10 years in jail.",
      "The student - Joshua Wong",
      "Arguably Hong Kong\u2019s most famous pro-democracy activist, Wong\u2019s journey into activism started when he was just 14.",
      "By 2014, he had become the face of the Umbrella Movement, a mass student protest with the umbrella as a symbol, which sprang up alongside the Occupy Central sit-in.",
      "He was just 20 when his activism landed him in jail, the first of what would be several convictions.",
      "In 2019, Hong Kong erupted in months-long protests as hundreds of thousands marched against a hugely controversial extradition bill that would allow Hongkongers to be sent to mainland China to face trial.",
      "Wong was among thousands who held a 15-hour siege of police headquarters in the Wan Chai district, pelting the building with eggs and spraying graffiti on its walls, in June that year.",
      "While the demonstrations at that time were widely seen as a spontaneous \u201cleaderless\" movement, prosecutors said he led that particular protest, pointing to a video of him calling for the crowd to \"completely besiege police headquarters\u201d.",
      "He was jailed for his role in them, and placed in solitary confinement.",
      "But he remained defiant after pleading guilty: \u201cPerhaps the authorities wish me to stay in prison one term after another. But I am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.\u201d",
      "He was still serving his sentence when he was charged with subversion under the NSL.",
      "Now, at 28, he has received a sentence of four years and eight months on Tuesday.",
      "The 'revolutionary' - Long hair",
      "Former opposition lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung, better known as Long Hair for his coiffure, once described himself as a \u201cMarxist revolutionary\u201d.",
      "The 68-year-old was known for his political theatrics - one of his signature moves involved hurling bananas as a sign of protest. When he was sworn in again as a lawmaker in 2016, he released a balloon with a political banner and held a yellow umbrella, declaring that the \u201cUmbrella Movement would never end\u201d.",
      "This got him disqualified from the council. He was arrested and had repeated stints in jail for taking part in the 2019  protests.",
      "After the NSL was imposed in 2020, he married his long-time partner, Vanessa Chan, also known as Chan Po-ying, who is a prominent activist. They were among the founding members of a political party, the League of Social Democrats.",
      "They said they decided to marry because should one of them be jailed, they would have greater legal rights such as prison visitation.",
      "Forty days after the wedding, Leung was charged.",
      "He has been jailed for six years and nine months.",
      "The longtime activist - Claudia Mo",
      "Claudia Mo, known affectionately in Cantonese as Auntie Mo, was a prominent opposition lawmaker.",
      "She had been a journalist at the AFP news agency, where she covered the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing.",
      "The 67-year-old helped set up the opposition Civic Party in 2006 and by 2012 she had won a seat in LegCo. She gave up British citizenship to hold office in Hong Kong.",
      "She was among 15 lawmakers who resigned en masse from LegCo after four pro-democracy lawmakers were ousted in November 2020. The move left LegCo with no opposition presence.",
      "\"We had to,\" she said at the time. \"We need to protest against what could be the ultimate Beijing crackdown on Hong Kong - to silence the last bit of dissent in the city.\"",
      "Police \"smashed through into the living room\" to arrest her in the early hours of 6 January 2021, the FT reported, citing an unnamed source who described the raid as \"sheer thuggery\".",
      "She has been in jail since then. When her husband, British journalist Philip Bowring, was critically ill, Mo was not allowed to visit him from prison.",
      "She was sentenced to four years and two months in jail.",
      "The LGBT campaigner  - Jimmy Sham",
      "A long-time political and LGBTQ activist, Jimmy Sham also led one of Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy groups, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF).",
      "The group disbanded in 2021, saying it could no longer operate amid \u201cunprecedented\u201d challenges posed by China\u2019s crackdown.",
      "Sham was violently attacked several times in 2019, and in one instance, was left on the streets with a head injury. The CHRF accused government supporters of this and other assaults against pro-democracy activists at the time, but it was never proven.",
      "The 37-year-old married his partner in New York in 2013 and fought for Hong Kong to recognise overseas same-sex marriages. Hong Kong\u2019s top court granted him a partial victory in 2023 when it ordered the government to establish a framework to  recognise same-sex partnerships.",
      "By then, Sham was in detention for his role in the Hong Kong primary.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:35:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The Nagas want to bring home human remains which colonial administrators had removed from the country.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Ellen Konyak was shocked to discover that a 19th-Century skull from the north-eastern Indian state of Nagaland was up for auction in the UK.",
      "The horned skull of a Naga tribesman was among thousands of items that European colonial administrators had collected from the state.",
      "Konyak, a member of the Naga Forum for Reconciliation (NFR) which is making efforts to bring these human remains back home, says the news of the auction disturbed her.",
      "\u201cTo see that people are still auctioning our ancestral human remains in the 21st Century was shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very insensitive and deeply hurtful.\u201d",
      "The Swan at Tetsworth, the UK-based antique centre that put the skull on auction, advertised it as part of their \u201cCurious Collector Sale\u201d, valued between \u00a33,500 ($4,490) and \u00a34,000 ($5,132). Alongside the skull - which is from a Belgian collection \u2013 the sale listed shrunken heads from the Jivaro people of South America and skulls from the Ekoi people of West Africa.",
      "Naga scholars and experts protested against the sale. The chief minister of Nagaland, Konyak\u2019s home state, wrote a letter to the Indian foreign ministry describing the act as \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201ccontinued colonial violence upon our people\u201d.",
      "The auction house withdrew the sale following the outcry, but for the Naga people the episode revived memories of their violent past, prompting them to renew calls for the repatriation of their ancestral remains stored or displayed far from their homeland.",
      "Scholars suggest that some of these human remains were bartered items or gifts, but others may have been taken away without the consent of their owners.",
      "Alok Kumar Kanungo, a scholar of Naga culture, estimates that the UK\u2019s public museums and private collections alone hold around 50,000 Naga objects.",
      "Oxford University's Pitt Rivers Museum (PRM), which has the largest Naga collection, features approximately 6,550 items taken from the state, including 41 human remains. The museum also has human remains from several other states of British India.",
      "But in recent years, experts say, with growing ethical concerns about collection, sale and display of human remains, many collectors are reconsidering their approach.",
      "Kanungo says human remains have become \u201cwhite elephants\u201d for museums.",
      "\"They are no longer an object that can be disposed of or possessed by its owners; no longer a source of tourists\u2019 money; can no longer be used to present Naga peoples as \u2018uncivilised\u2019; and of late have become an emotionally and politically charged issue.\u201d",
      "So, museums have started returning human remains from communities such as the Maori tribes of New Zealand, the Mudan warriors of Taiwan, the Aboriginal people of Australia and the Native Hawaiians.",
      "In 2019, PRM told the BBC that it had returned 22 such objects.",
      "A museum spoksperson told the BBC that the figure has now gone up to 35. \"So far these [objects] have all been returned to Australia, New Zealand, US and Canada.\"",
      "As part of an ethical review, the museum removed Naga skulls from public display in 2020 and placed them in storage. This is when FNR demanded their repatriation for the first time.",
      "The museum said it was yet to receive a formal claim from Naga descendants and the processes to return human remains \"can take between 18 months and several years, depending on the complexity of the case\".",
      "Repatriating human remains is more complicated than returning artefacts. It requires extensive research to determine whether the items were collected ethically, to identify descendants and to navigate complex international regulations on movement of human remains.",
      "The Naga forum has formed a group called Recover, Restore and Decolonise under anthropologists Dolly Kikon and Arkotong Longkumer to facilitate returns.",
      "\u201cIt is a bit like detective work,\u201d Longkumer said. \u201cWe have to sift through different layers of information and try to read between the lines to actually find out about the exact nature of the collections and where they are from.\u201d",
      "But for the Naga people, this process is not merely logistical. \u201cWe are dealing with human remains,\u201d said Konyak. \u201cIt\u2019s an international and legal process, but it\u2019s also a spiritual one for us.\u201d",
      "The group has been travelling to villages, meeting Naga elders, organising lectures and distributing educational materials such as comic books and videos to spread awareness.",
      "They are also trying to build consensus around subjects such as the last rites of repatriated remains. Most Nagas now follow Christianity, but their ancestors were animists who followed different birth and death rituals.",
      "The group found that even Naga elders were unaware that their ancestral remains were in foreign land. Anthropologist and archaeologist Tiatoshi Jamir said one elder told him that this could make \u201cthe soul of their ancestors restless\u201d.",
      "Jamir said even he was not aware about the skulls on display in foreign museums until he read about them in a local paper in the early 2000s.",
      "The British took over the Naga areas in 1832 and, in 1873, introduced a special permission for travellers \u2013 called the Inner Line Permit \u2013 to strictly control access to the region.",
      "Historians say the colonial administrators put down any rebellions and often burnt Naga villages to subdue them, in the process erasing much of their important cultural markers such as paintings, engravings and artefacts.",
      "Konyak says she has discovered that one of the human remains in PRM's list is of a person from her village and tribe.",
      "\u201cI am like, \u2018Oh my goodness! It belongs to one of my ancestors',\" she told the BBC.",
      "She is still undecided about how the last rites would be performed once the remains are returned.",
      "\u201cBut we want them back as a mark of respect to our elders,\u201d she said. \u201cTo reclaim our history. To claim our narrative.\u201d",

      "The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur supporter has quite the reputation.",
      "He is an intellectual educated at Oxford University, is never seen without his signature slim, rectangular glasses and has been dubbed \"Mr Digital\" thanks to his pledge to whip Ghana into a technological heavyweight.",
      "But because he is head of the government's economic management team, many Ghanaians associate Bawumia with the punishing cost of living crisis they're experiencing.",
      "Should Bawumia overcome the criticism and win the election, he will replace his current boss President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is approaching the end of his two-term limit.",
      "\"Mr Digital\" barrelled onto the political scene in 2008, sparking bemusement and scepticism.",
      "Bawumia was a 44-year-old who had never held public office, yet Akufo-Addo - then a mere presidential candidate - had chosen him as a running mate.",
      "Bawumia's father Alhaji Mumuni had served in Ghana's earliest governments after the country gained independence from Britain in 1957, working closely with revered Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah.",
      "But the younger Bawumia had forged a career in economics and banking - serving as the deputy governor of Ghana's central bank.",
      "To many commentators and NPP insiders, it made no sense for Akufo-Addo to pick Bawumia over seasoned party members.",
      "Akufo-Addo ended up losing the election to John Atta Mills from the National Democratic Congress (NDC) by a tiny margin.",
      "Bawumia lost out on the VP job - but his charismatic campaign had silenced the naysayers.",

      "Akufo-Addo and Bawumia gave the elections another go in 2012. Again, they lost.",
      "The NPP challenged the election results in the Supreme Court, choosing Bawumia as their star witness.",
      "During the proceedings, which were broadcast on national television, Bawumia came across as witty and unflustered by the relentless, days-long cross-examination.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, who is this guy? He's really the guy to root for,\" said Dr Sefa-Nyarko, who lectures on African leadership at King's College London.",
      "Akufo-Addo decided to keep Bawumia on his ticket and in 2016, on their third shot at power, the NPP won with 51.3% of the vote. Bawumia finally became vice-president.",
      "Bawumia's journey to the top began in 1963, when he was born into a large family in the northern city of Tamale.",

      "To support himself during his studies, he took up jobs as a taxi driver and cleaner.",
      "He returned to Ghana in 2000 to work at the central bank, where he worked his way up to become deputy governor.",
      "Bawumia campaigned on this economic know-how during his attempts to become VP. Therefore, he faced heavy criticism when Ghana plummeted into its most severe economic crisis in years under his watch.",
      "Inflation hit a record 54% in December 2022 and the country was forced to take a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund after government debt soared.",
      "In response to the criticism, Bawumia has said the economic management team he headed had no \"decision-making powers\" and that it merely provided advice to the government.",
      "But for many, this wasn't good enough.",
      "\"In terms of character, in terms of integrity, people started questioning themselves: 'What is this? How did it end up here? We thought you were the best guy, and look at where we've ended up',\" Franklin Cudjoe, a Ghanaian political commentator and head of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, told the BBC.",
      "Along with his role as an economist, Bawumia has also built the reputation of being a digital visionary.",
      "Ghana's digital ecosystem has seen \"significant growth\" especially in areas such as mobile phone connectivity, Charles Abani, head of the United Nations team in Ghana, remarked last month.",
      "This \"remarkable digital transformation\" was \"spearheaded\" by Bawumia, news website African Business reported, while Ghanaian newspaper The Chronicle hailed Bawumia's \"expertise in global digital transformation\".",
      "Bawumia said he initiated a partnership between Ghana's government and US-based company Zipline, which led to the creation of the world's largest vaccine delivery network.",
      "He said he reached out to Zipline, which uses drones to fly health products to hard-to-reach clinics, after his father died from a loss of blood.",
      "Although this passion for technology is celebrated by some, others are more sceptical.",
      "Mr Cudjoe said Bawumia has been campaigning on digitalisation rather than confronting debates about the government's handling of the economy.",
      "\"Whether Bawumia was in power or not, digitalisation was bound to happen in this country because we had already started it anyway,\" Mr Cudjoe said.",
      "Dr Sefa-Nyarko said of Bawumia: \"What he has been very successful at is to push and also claim all credit for digitalisation outcomes of the current government.\"",
      "Bawumia's personal life has also been a strength in his presidential campaign. His wife of 20 years, Samira, is a former beauty queen who is widely admired for her chic outfits.",
      "The Second Lady is also vocal when it comes to party politics - and has embarked on campaign tours for the NPP.",
      "The couple have four children together. They are proud followers of Islam - a religion practised by roughly one in five Ghanaians.",
      "Most people in Ghana are Christians but there is not much evidence that coming from a religious minority will hinder Bawumia's election chances, Dr Sefa-Nyarko said.",
      "The NPP has given its \"full support\" to Bawumia's candidacy, \"his Muslim faith notwithstanding\", Dr Sefa-Nyarko added.",
      "\"This could translate into widespread support across the country as well.\"",
      "Bawumia's geographical identity might be of greater consequence than his religion. The vice-president hails from northern Ghana, which is one of the NDC's strongest political bases.",
      "By choosing Bawumia as its presidential candidate, the NPP will be hoping to make inroads in the north, while retaining support in its heartland in the south.",
      "Bawumia has been traversing north, south, east and west in what he calls the \"possibilities bus\", a blue and red campaign vehicle emblazoned with the slogan \"it is possible\".",
      "To some, he is the face of economic mismanagement, but the vice-president retains some of the optimism he held when he was a 44-year-old embarking on an eight-year battle for power.",
      "\"I have the courage to accept when things do not go as well as planned,\" he told voters in his manifesto.",
      "\"But I also have a mindset of possibilities, and faith in ourselves, that we can rise and achieve great things in our lifetime.\"",

    "title": "Who wins when Nigeria's richest man takes on the 'oil mafia'?",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:30:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Having built a $20bn oil refinery, Aliko Dangote is now at the heart of a row in the murky industry.",
    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:13:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Indians are being stripped of their life savings by savvy scammers putting them under \"digital arrest\".",
    "story": [
      "For a harrowing week in August, Ruchika Tandon, a 44-year-old neurologist at one of India\u2019s top hospitals, was ensnared in what felt like a high-stakes federal crime investigation.",
      "Yet, it was an elaborate scam - a web of deceit spun by scammers who manipulated her every move and drained her and her family\u2019s life savings.",
      "Under the pretence of \u201cdigital arrest\u201d- a term fabricated by her perpetrators - Dr Tandon was coerced to take leave from work, surrender her daily freedoms, and comply with nonstop surveillance and instructions from strangers on the phone, who convinced her she was at the centre of a grave investigation.",
      "The \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officials on video calls, threatening victims with arrest over fake charges, and pressuring them to transfer large sums of money.",
      "In Dr Tandon's case, they stripped her and her family of nearly 25m rupees ($300,000; \u00a3235,000) across bank accounts, mutual funds, pension funds, and life insurance  - years of savings lost in a manufactured nightmare.",
      "She is not alone. Indians lost over 1,200m rupees to \u201cdigital arrest\u201d hoaxes between January and April this year, according to official figures. These figures only scratch the surface, as many victims don\u2019t report such crimes. Stolen funds are often funnelled into overseas accounts or cryptocurrency wallets. More than 40% of the scams have been traced back to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, according to officials.",
      "Things are so bad that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the scam in his monthly radio talk in October.",
      "\"Whenever you receive such a call, don\u2019t be scared. You should be aware that no investigative agency ever inquires like this through a phone call or a video call,\" he said.",
      "India faces a range of cyber crimes, from fake investment and trading to dating scams. But the \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam stands out as especially elaborate and sinister - meticulously planned, relentless, and invasive to every part of a victim's life.",
      "Sometimes scammers reveal themselves during video calls, while other times they remain hidden, relying solely on audio. The plot could be straight out of an outlandish Bollywood thriller - except it is carefully choreographed.",
      "On that fateful first day, scammers posing as officials from India\u2019s telecom regulator called Lucknow-based Dr Tandon, claiming her number would be disconnected due to \u201c22 complaints\u201d of harassing messages sent from it.",
      "Moments later, a man claiming to be a senior police officer took over. He accused her of using a joint bank account with her mother to launder money for women and child trafficking.",
      "In the background, a jarring chorus of voices echoed, \u201cArrest her, arrest her!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe police will be coming in five minutes to arrest you. All police stations have been alerted,\u201d the man warned.",
      "\u201cI was angry and frustrated. I kept saying this can\u2019t be true,\u201d Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "The officer seemed to soften, but with a catch. He said India\u2019s federal detective agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), would take over as it was a \u201cmatter of national secrecy\".",
      "\u201cI will try to talk and persuade them not to put you in physical custody. But you have to be in digital custody,\u201d he insisted.",
      "Dr Tandon used a feature phone that lacked video calling, making it impossible for the scammers to proceed. So they forced her to drive to a store and buy a smartphone.",
      "Over the next six days, three men and a woman, posing as police officers and a judge, kept her under constant surveillance on Skype, with her phone camera running nonstop.",
      "They made her wake up her students at night to buy extra data packs to keep the scam going. She was required to place the phone throughout the house - while cooking, sleeping, and even outside the bathroom - tracking her every move.",
      "She was also forced to lie to her hospital and relatives, claiming she was too ill to work or meet anyone. When an uncle visited, they ordered her to hide under a bed, with the phone camera running.",
      "For a full week, Dr Tandon endured more 700 questions on her life and work, a staged trial, falsified court documents, and promises of a digital \u201cbail\u201d in exchange for her life savings. In the fake court she was ordered to dress in white to \u201cshow respect to the judge\". The callers had switched off their video, leaving only their fake names and authentic-looking badges displayed on blank screens.",
      "At one point, during the ordeal, the scammers even talked to Dr Tandon\u2019s 70-year-old mother, urging her to stay silent \"for her daughter\u2019s sake\".",
      "When the doctor repeatedly broke down on camera, the scammers told her: \u201cTake a deep breath and relax. You have not committed a murder. You have just laundered money.\"",
      "In a desperate bid for freedom, she transferred her entire savings from half-a-dozen different bank accounts to accounts controlled by the scammers, believing she would be refunded after \u201cgovernment verification\". Instead, she lost everything. The callers disconnected the line after transfer was completed.",
      "Back at work after a week, exhaustion drove Dr Tandon to search terms like \u201cdigital custody\u201d and \u201cnew CBI investigation methods\u201d on the internet.",
      "This led to newspaper stories detailing similar \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scams across the country. She still had refused to accept she was a victim of an elaborate hoax, and had rushed to the police station, hoping that \u201cthe police station and officers were real\u201d.",
      "Dr Tandon says she approached the police station, anxious.",
      "\"I've been receiving strange calls for days,\" she started, trying to explain.",
      "Before she could say more, a woman officer interrupted sharply, \"Have you transferred any money?\"",
      "At another police station, \"the moment they heard my case, they began laughing\", Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "\"This is very common now,\u201d a policeman said.",
      "Over 500km (310 miles) away in Delhi, author and journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay narrowly escaped the scam in July.",
      "He endured 28 hours under \"digital arrest,\" as scammers claimed that his defunct bank account had been used to launder money. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s suspicions aroused when a caller asked him why he hadn't redeemed his mutual funds - not a question a police officer would usually ask on the phone.",
      "Mr Mukhopadhyay slipped from his study, where scammers were surveilling him on his desktop, and confided briefly with his wife. Friends, alerted by his message, quickly asked her to disconnect his modem, freeing him from their grip.",
      "\"I became a digital slave until my friends exposed the scam,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"I had moved my funds into my account, ready to transfer it all to them. I felt like a fool when it was over.\u201d",
      "Progress on catching these scammers remains unclear, with many victims frustrated by slow moving complaint processes.",
      "Dr Tandon, however, has seen some success: police have arrested 18 suspects, including a woman, from across India. About a third of the stolen money has been recovered in cash and seized in different bank accounts.  She has received only 1.2m of the 25m rupees of her looted money so far \u2013 that was the cash recovered.",
      "Investigating officer Deepak Kumar Singh says the scammers were running an elaborate operation.",
      "\"The scammers are educated men and women - fluent in English and various Indian languages - including engineering graduates, cyber security experts, and banking professionals. Most operate through Telegram channels,\" Mr Singh, a senior police official, told the BBC.",
      "The scammers were clever, using targeted information from their victims' social media, investigators believe.",
      "\"They track you, gather personal information, and identify your weaknesses,\" says Mr Singh. \"Then they strike quickly, using a hit-and-run approach with potential victims.\"",
      "The scammers knew Mr Mukhopadhyay was a journalist and writer - author of a biography on Prime Minister Modi. They knew Dr Tandon was a doctor and had attended a conference in Goa. They had their biometric national identity numbers. Mr Mukhopadhyay wonders if they were aware he was among the journalists whose house was raided by Delhi police in October 2023 as part of an investigation into the funding of NewsClick (Critics had deplored the move as an attack on press freedom, a charge the government denied.)",
      "They also made errors. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s caller was unaware of how long it typically took to redeem funds, which raised his suspicions. Dr Tandon\u2019s fake judge, called himself Judge Dhananjay and displayed a fake insignia with a picture of the recently retired Chief Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud. Yet, overwhelmed by the moment, she missed the clue.",
      "Dr Tandon says she still lives in a haze, struggling to separate reality from the nightmare that overtook her life. Even when she filed the police complaint, she wondered, \u201cWas the police station also fake?\u201d",
      "Every phone call stirs fresh anxiety.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:34:47 -0500",
    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",
      "\"That's what I've been asking ever since I met you guys,\" Simon added with a smile.",
      "Dr. Cheng said simply: \"We're working on it.\"",

      "Payne died from \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\" after the fall from the hotel, a postmortem examination found. The balcony attached to his room overlooked a rear patio, about 45 feet high.",
      "Hotel staff had called emergency services twice to report a guest \"overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" who was \"destroying\" a hotel room. Investigators have said Payne was alone at the time and appeared to have been \"going through an episode of substance abuse.\"",
      "In early November, Argentine prosecutors said three people had been charged in connection with Payne's death, including one person whom they said had spent time with Payne every day he was in Buenos Aires.

    "summary": "For years, actor and comedian Katt Williams has claimed he lied about his age as a teenager to join the Marines and passed boot camp before being drummed out. The Marines have no record of him ever serving.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 Katt Williams, the Emmy-winning actor and renowned stand-up comedian, for years has claimed to have joined the U.S. Marine Corps as a teenager and successfully navigated the rigorous training only to be drummed out of the military when his superiors discovered he was a minor. The Marines told CBS News they have no record of him.",
      "Dating back to at least 2016, Williams has claimed association with the U.S. Marine Corps when talking about his personal biography in video blogs, in his stand-up routines and in interviews viewed and heard by tens of millions of people. His claims of military service seem to not be attached to any of his critically acclaimed jokes or characters he has created for stage and screen but instead, a part of his journey towards comedy.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps tells CBS News there's no record of Williams ever entering military service or attending any Marine Corps recruit training camps.",
      "Multiple emails and phone calls were sent to Williams' publicist, Amy Sisoyev, and his representatives at Creative Artists Agency, but no reply was returned for almost two weeks.",
      "Earlier this year, Williams sat down for a nearly 3-hour interview with ESPN's \"First Take\" correspondent Shannon Sharpe on his podcast, \"Club Shay Shay.\" The interview has racked up\u00a0more than 83 million views on YouTube as of publication and is the most watched interview in YouTube's history.",
      "Sharpe, a former Denver Bronco and ex-NFL analyst for CBS Sports, asked Williams about being raised in Florida.",
      "\"I try to join the Marine Corps and they won't accept me because I'm too young, and I've lied and told them I'm 16 and my family is moving down and I don't have my ID but it's coming. And so they [the Marines] let me go to the boot camp,\" said Williams.",
      "Similarly, on comedian Marc Maron's podcast last year, Williams said, \"And then I attempt to join the Marine Corps, and I go off to boot camp and I pass, and then they reveal that I'm too young, and they give me a little ceremony because I did pass, you know, oo-Rah.\"",
      "He added: \"I wasn't even 16. I wasn't even 16. I was already \u2014 I had miscalculated it wrong. I thought that you know, by the time I got back I would be good, but I hadn't turned 16 by the time boot camp was over.\"",
      "Maron, whose \"WTF\" podcast garners more than 55 million listens per year, asked Williams if he got through boot camp and about his ceremony.",
      "Williams reaffirmed that he passed boot camp, saying, \"When you come back everybody gets the ceremony and I was supposed to have been, probably put in the brig or court-martialed or something, but they didn't treat me like that. \u2026 As far as the Marine Corps thing, whatever those commercials were selling, you remember those commercials back in that time \u2026 if you wanted to join a gang, the Marines was the gang to join.\"",
      "On Saturday, CBS News attended the Vulture Festival in Los Angeles where Williams was interviewed about his life and career by Jesse David Fox, a Vulture writer and host of \"Good One: The Podcast About Jokes.\" Williams is set to launch his multistate \"Heaven on Earth\" tour next year.",
      "While Williams did not discuss his alleged short stint in the Marines, the comedian said \"Thank God I tell the truth\" when asked by Fox about his past statements in interviews.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records pertaining to Williams' alleged enlistment in the Marine Corps.",
      "Marine Corps officials searched for records pertaining to Williams using his full name \u2014 Micah Sierra Williams \u2014 and other identifying information such as his date of birth and social security number. Officials told CBS News that their database of official military personnel files dates back to the 1960s, housed at the National Personnel Records Center of the National Archives.",
      "\"We searched the files maintained by the Manpower Management Performance Branch but were unable to identify Mr. Williams as a member or former member of the U.S. Marine Corps,\" wrote an official in response to CBS News' public records request.",
      "Marine Corps officials told CBS News that if Williams' story was accurate, there would be records showing his entry into military service, his graduation and discharge, even if he fraudulently enlisted as a minor.",
      "Army veteran Anthony Anderson, who runs \"Guardians of Valor,\" a popular social media website that investigates service member records, told CBS News that Williams' claims are a \"slap in the face of people who have earned the title of Marine.\"",
      "\"Boot camp for the Marine Corps is not an easy task. To call yourself a Marine, you have to go through at least 13 weeks of boot camp and successfully navigate the crucible \u2026 people have died in training at boot camp trying to earn the title of Marine,\" said Anderson.",
      "While it's unclear when exactly Williams began to claim he graduated from Marine boot camp, the earliest examples CBS News could find stemmed from Williams' 2016 feud with actor and comedian Kevin Hart.",
      "In a video that appears to have been\u00a0recorded by Williams, addressing drug abuse allegations, the comedian says, \"Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps, I can only breathe out of one nostril.\"",
      "That same year, Williams was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and battery charges after a fight at an apartment complex in Gainesville, Georgia, with a 17-year-old high school wrestler who was also charged, according to previous news reports. Williams pleaded not guilty and the case lingered on until earlier this year when local prosecutors decided to drop the case against Williams.",
      "Soon after his arrest Williams spoke about the episode on stage, suggesting that he wasn't actually put into a chokehold by the teenager and in fact, that Williams had let him win, adding, \"I'm Semper Fi till I die, Marine Corps b----. I passed motherf---ing boot camp at 16.\"",
      "Williams' routine was removed from YouTube due to copyright infringement issues, but the video still exists in the reader forum on Military.com, a military news and culture website. A user posted the video to the website in 2016 and asked: \"Katt Williams a Marine?\"",

    "summary": "With the release of part one of her new memoir, Cher talks about her relationship - on stage and off - with Sonny Bono, and why their TV partnership survived beyond their marriage.",
    "story": [
      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",

    "summary": "CDC data shows rates of Mycoplasma pneumoniae have surged in babies.",
    "story": [
      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"Maybe it's another one of those things that we didn't see, got really suppressed during COVID, and now it's coming back,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at Golisano Children's Hospital in New York. \"It just is definitely a really bad year for Mycoplasma.\"",
      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said that it has also tracked a \"marked increase\" in Mycoplasma pneumoniae based on data from the state's emergency rooms, compared to previous years.",
      "While not all pneumonia cases warrant antibiotics, Nayak said testing can be important to give answers for children and their families battling persistent or serious pneumonia cases, as well as to help make decisions about how to treat the infections.",
      "\"The amoxicillin your child is getting because they might have an ear infection, or you think you're treating another community-acquired pneumonia, those antibiotics will not be effective against Mycoplasma,\" Nayak said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",

      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",

    "summary": "Canada's Bestar recalled wall beds only after learning of dozens of cases in which its beds detached from the walls, feds say.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It\u00a0operates\u00a0manufacturing plants in Lac-Megantic and Sherbrooke, Canada, as well as in Jamestown, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, Reno, Nevada, Sacramento, California and Asia.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:51:24 -0500",
    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",
      "There's no real understanding of how these people can do this, but you can certainly understand why. An emotional Vivek Puri said, \"It's nice to be good at something.\"",

      "\"What I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, speaking at an event hosted by the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., this week,\u00a0ahead of Trump's decision.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under Trump. Instead, Kennedy has promised to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding.",
      "Marks flatly rebuked Kennedy's claims about the safety data.",
      "\"There's no secret files. I mean, if they're secret, I hold a security clearance. If they are secret from me then, they must be at some other level of classification,\" he said.",

      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that has often clashed with the FDA, likened the pick to \"putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA.\"",
      "Marks, a career civil servant who played a key role in launching the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, says he has \"sat in the room\" across from Kennedy when vaccines were discussed multiple times.",
      "While he said he worries that spending time \"re-litigating things that we know work\" could undermine other important FDA efforts \u2014 and could be potentially deadly during a future pandemic if it further erodes confidence in vaccines \u2014 Marks also said that working with RFK Jr. could turn out to have a silver lining.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" he said.",
      "Marks rejected Kennedy's claims that the FDA is filled with corrupt officials who need to be fired, stressing that the staff is dedicated to protecting Americans' health. Marks said he hopes to keep his job under Trump and Kennedy, and to protect the team at his center.",
      "\"They do what they do to protect the American people. Not for any kind of nefarious purpose. And during the COVID pandemic, people worked 14 hours a day,\" Marks said of the agency's staff.",
      "Kennedy has vowed to end what he calls the agency's \"war on public health,\" warning workers who are \"part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "He has also specifically pledged to fire all of the nutritional scientists at the FDA and other agencies on his first day, accusing them of being co-opted by corporate interests.",
      "\"I look forward to working with the more than 80,000 employees at HHS to free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth,\" Kennedy posted Thursday on X.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's scientific expertise, Marks said he thought Kennedy's understanding is \"not as deep as others,\" but added, \"I know a number of attorneys who know more than most PhDs and MDs about medicine. So it's not the degree. It's just a matter of keeping an open mind.\"",
      "While Kennedy's pick for the role was just announced on Thursday, health officials have been bracing for the possibility for a while. During the campaign, Trump vowed he'd let Kennedy to \"go wild\" on health if he won.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",

      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "summary": "Thanksgiving dinners will cost less if you buy store-brand products. Here's how much savings they offer.",
    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to be commerce secretary, a position in which he'd have a key role in carrying out Trump's plans to raise and enforce tariffs.",
      "Trump announced his pick Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "Lutnick is a co-chair of Trump's transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who was the Small Business Administration administrator in Trump's first administration. Both are tasked with putting forward candidates for key roles in the next administration.",
      "Lutnick has also donated millions to the effort to re-elect Trump and other Republicans. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump in August that raised $15 million and also gave $5 million to the Make America Great Again PAC, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Trump and his campaign worked to distance themselves from Project 2025 in the months leading up to Election Day, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals \"abysmal.\" Lutnick told CNBC he had read Project 2025 but had not met with any of its authors.",
      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk and others in Trump's orbit were calling on Trump to dump the previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in his post that \"Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0 Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\"My father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\"",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer's brand, led today by Pauline Frommer, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy - stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants - changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\" That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.",
      "The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks.",
      "\"It was really pioneering stuff,\" Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \"that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\"",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\"",
      "Frommer guides reborn",
      "The concept no longer made sense when hotels couldn't be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire didn't disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer - in a David vs. Goliath triumph - got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\"I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,\" he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show.",
      "He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony posts. And he coined the phrase \"Trump Slump\" in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president the first time.",
      "Depression-era roots",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight.",
      "Eventually, he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe\" and, a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece and distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after, he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\" was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Frommer eventually gave up law to write the guides full-time.",
      "Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Dispelling false impressions",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \"most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. ... And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "He added: \"We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.\"",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \"I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\" he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \"It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\"",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:56:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit's bankruptcy filing will likely mean higher airfares across airlines as it trims schedule, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines, the airline of choice for many budget travelers, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, raising questions about the viability of no-frills airlines in the post-pandemic era, as consumer preferences shift toward more premium offerings.",
      "Customers with plans to fly on the airline over Thanksgiving and beyond are also concerned about what the filing means for their upcoming trips, as well as airfares generally.",
      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",
      "Additionally, Spirit customers can still benefit from the airline's Free Spirit loyalty program, as well as accrue and redeem Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms.",
      "Schedule modifications",
      "That said, industry experts advise customers to keep a close eye on their upcoming bookings. That includes updating their contact information so that the airline can reach them with modifications to their flights.",
      "\"Make sure your contact information is up to date, and keep an eagle eye on your reservations,\" Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy \u2014 a site focused on airline deals and travel rewards \u2014 told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There's no need to panic, Kelly said, but the airline is expected to trim its schedule, which could result in your flight time changing, or being canceled.",
      "\"They're not going to stop flying tomorrow, but inevitably they're going to emerge an even smaller airline after this process, so that means there are going to be some hiccups with routes,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it's filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed attempts to sell itself to other carriers.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations it was unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "The move was widely expected.",
      "Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a \"prearranged, streamlined\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.",
      "The Chapter 11 process itself won't impact Spirit employee's wages or benefits, the airline said.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\"The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\" he told investors during an earnings call. \"We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\"",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They're just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they're paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit's red ink.",
      "It's not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded.",
      "What's been ailing Spirit",
      "There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit's costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit's budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit's core business \u2014 have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit's traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That was a huge change from Spirit's longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt pointed out to CBS News that, on one hand, some people \"are saying, 'You know what? I'm doing better than I thought financially and I can afford maybe to upgrade to an airline that has extra leg room or something like that.' And Spirit has missed that opportunity.\"",
      "On the other hand, Harteveldt notes, lots of Spirit's customers \"haven't been able to afford to fly to the same extent that they used to because of the higher cost of everyday living.\"",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines that are forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "Spirit said in an October regulatory filing that it had identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year, according to\u00a0CBS News Miami. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \"reduction in workforce,\" the Florida-based airline noted. The carrier also disclosed that it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million.",
      "Mergers didn't materialize",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It\u00a0operates\u00a0manufacturing plants in Lac-Megantic and Sherbrooke, Canada, as well as in Jamestown, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, Reno, Nevada, Sacramento, California and Asia.",

    "summary": "Mike Tyson, a boxing legend, and Jake Paul, a social media legend, threw down Friday in Dallas. Financially, they both came out winners.",
    "story": [
      "Jake Paul, a former child star and social media influencer who started boxing professionally in 2020, slugged it out with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Friday in a matchup that was livestreamed worldwide on Netflix. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",
      "Though promotors did not reveal exactly how much Tyson earned for Friday's fight, reports from online sources,\u00a0including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",

      "Who do gamblers think will win the fight?",
      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings. That means a $100 wager on post-retirement Iron Mike will bring in a $160 profit if he wins. At -200, Paul is the favorite to win. Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:31:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Americans looking to purchase EVs may want to do so quickly, as the incoming administration is likely to axe a $7,500 tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",

      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Postal Service's loss widened in fiscal 2024, although revenue rose slightly after two stamp hikes this year.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",
      "Yoder, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas, also criticized the USPS for focusing on packages rather than traditional mail delivery, which he said remains the largest revenue generator for the postal service.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to prohibit transgender women from using women's bathrooms and other facilities on Capitol Hill, a proposal that comes just before the House prepares to swear-in the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "Mace's two-page resolution would bar House members, officers and employees from using single-sex facilities in the Capitol or House office buildings that do not correspond with their biological sex. Her proposal claims that allowing biological males into women's restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity\" of female lawmakers, officers and Capitol Hill employees.",
      "The House sergeant-at-arms would be tasked with enforcing the measure, if approved.",
      "The South Carolina Republican's legislation appears to target Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress when she won the race for the state's only House seat two weeks ago.",
      "McBride called Mace's resolution a \"blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement Wednesday that single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House office buildings, like restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, \"are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\" He noted that each member's office has a private restroom and said there are unisex restrooms throughout the Capitol.",
      "\"Women deserve women's only spaces,\" he said.",
      "McBride said she will follow the rules outlined by Johnson \"even if I disagree with them.\"",
      "\"This effort to distract from the real issues facing this country hasn't distracted me over the last several days, as I've remained hard at work preparing to represent the greatest state in the union come January,\" she said in a statement shared to social media.",
      "Johnson's statement came on Transgender Day of Remembrance, which is observed on Nov. 20 and honors transgender people who have died from violence. He acknowledged Tuesday that the issue of restroom access for transgender lawmakers is one the lower chamber has not confronted before, but told reporters that the House would address it \"in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it, and we will accommodate the needs of every single person.\"",
      "Johnson said he would not \"engage in silly debates\" when asked whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people,\" Johnson said. \"I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this.\"",
      "He declined to say whether he plans to include Mace's proposal in a package of rules that will govern the next Congress.",
      "\"We don't look down upon anyone. We treat everybody with dignity and respect. That's a principle that I've pursued my whole life,\" he said. \"And we will take care of this issue of first impression for Congress as we will any other thing. We'll provide appropriate accommodation for every member of Congress.\"",
      "Johnson later sought to clarify his response about whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"A man is a man and a woman is a woman and a man cannot become a woman,\" he said. \"That said, I also believe \u2014 that's what Scripture teaches, what I just said \u2014 but I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.\"",
      "House Democrats condemned Mace's resolution and accused her of bullying a fellow member of Congress.",
      "\"This is what we're doing? This is the lesson that you've drawn from the election in November? This is your priority, that you want to bully a member of Congress, as opposed to welcoming her to join this body so all of us can work together to get things done and deliver real results for the American people?\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, called the proposal \"disgusting\" and said, \"I was sick to my stomach when I read that.\"",
      "Mace, meanwhile, claimed that she is being targeted and vowed to introduce new legislation that focuses on protecting \"women and girls everywhere.\" She said if Johnson does not include her resolution in the package of rules for the new Congress, she would seek to amend it or force a vote on her measure.",

    "summary": "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz is meeting with Senate Republicans as he seeks to shore up support after Donald Trump tapped the embattled GOP firebrand as his pick for attorney general.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz is meeting with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he seeks to shore up support for his nomination for attorney general amid calls for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Accompanied by Vice President-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, Gaetz is sitting down with Republican senators, whose votes will be crucial in confirming him to the position of the nation's top law enforcement officer next year. The GOP is set to take control of the Senate in the next Congress and hold 53 seats, but Gaetz will need backing from a majority of the chamber to win confirmation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for attorney general last week, after which the Florida Republican resigned his seat from Congress. But the selection and Gaetz's resignation came two days before the House Ethics Committee was poised to meet and vote on whether to make public its report detailing the findings of its long-running investigation into allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "The Republican has denied wrongdoing and called the Ethics probe a \"smear.\" He has blamed the investigation on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom\u00a0Gaetz helped oust last year. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump told reporters Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection for attorney general.",
      "Gaetz and Vance have so far met with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Kennedy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas. The six\u00a0sit on the Judiciary Committee, which will conduct Gaetz's confirmation hearings early next year.",
      "Hawley told CBS News that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need to get a confirmation hearing and ensure that Gaetz gets an opportunity \"to respond in public, under oath.\" Hawley outlined that he thinks Gaetz has talked to every member of the Judiciary Committee and many other senators who do not sit on the committee. He said he expects Gaetz to meet with all 53 incoming Republicans over the coming weeks.",
      "\"President Trump is very committed to moving this forward. And I know there's been some speculation among my colleagues that maybe this wouldn't actually go to a confirmation hearing, but they want one, and I think they're absolutely entitled to have that,\" he said. \"Gaetz wants the opportunity to testify, to respond to critics, answer questions, talk about his vision for the department.\"",
      "Hawley is likely to vote for all of Trump's nominees, he said, and believes there will be \"no shortage of information\" about Gaetz available for senators.",
      "At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she has not been asked to meet with Gaetz yet. Collins is among the most moderate members of the conference, and her vote could be critical to Gaetz's confirmation. She previously said she was \"shocked\" by his selection.",
      "After his meeting with Gaetz, Graham said that while he tends to defer to presidential Cabinet choices \"unless the evidence suggests disqualification,\" the process for Trump's selections \"will not be a rubber stamp, nor will it be driven by a lynch mob.\"",
      "\"I fear the process surrounding the Gaetz nomination is turning into an angry mob, and unverified allegations are being treated as if they are true. I have seen this movie before,\" he said, an apparent reference to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process in 2018. \"I would urge all of my Senate colleagues, particularly Republicans, not to join the lynch mob and give the process a chance to move forward.\"",
      "Lee, speaking with reporters following his meeting with Gaetz, said Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings should be a \"warning\" amid the allegations against the Florida Republican.",
      "\"There were a lot of allegations thrown at Brett Kavanaugh that turned out to be uncorroborated in many, many instances,\" Lee said. \"And so I do think that is something of a voice of warning people ought to take. Just because allegations are made, and just because people talk a lot about them \u2014 and sometimes in a fit of politically driven eagerness to embrace them, assume their\u00a0 truth \u2014 doesn't mean that they are, in fact, true.\"",
      "Kavanaugh was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct decades earlier and vehemently denied the accusations. The Judiciary Committee held a set of extraordinary hearings that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he assaulted her during a party when they were in high school in the 1980s. Classmates who were at the party, however, could not corroborate Ford's allegations. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote, the narrowest margin in more than a century.",
      "Gaetz has been under investigation for several years by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, which looked into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation. It said in a rare statement that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, among those the claims of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts, giving \"special privileges and favors\" and obstructing government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS news at the time that four women testified to the Ethics panel that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

    "story": [
      "The Pentagon office investigating UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified anomalous phenomena, resolved one of its most prominent cases \u2014 nicknamed \"GOFAST\" \u2014 its director told Congress in a hearing on Tuesday. (It's the last one listed on the office's website here).",
      "The GOFAST video was made public in 2017 and shows what appears to be an object flying at a high speed just above water, but Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress the object depicted is not actually too unusual.",
      "\"Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\" Kosloski said.",
      "Kosloski did not identify the object, but he said that a \"trick of the eye\" called parallax made the object appear anomalous \u2014 or out of the ordinary \u2014 when it was not. He said a detailed report on parallax will be available on the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office website.",
      "The \"GOFAST\" video was recorded by a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the East coast of the U.S. and made public in 2017.",
      "Former F/A-18 pilot Ryan Graves, who has spoken with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" about UAP sightings and later founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, told NBC News Now in an interview after the hearing that the Pentagon should continue to investigate the GOFAST case.",
      "\"I would argue that some of these cases aren't quote unquote debunked or no longer of interest, specifically the GOFAST video itself was never really interesting because it was going fast,\" Graves said. \"The pilots certainly didn't say that, nor did they name the video. If anything, the Pentagon simply debunked their own naming for that video.\"",
      "Graves also said there were more objects in the air at the time than the one depicted in the GOFAST video. The Pentagon is still investigating another video nicknamed GIMBAL that was taken around the time of the GOFAST video.",
      "After providing examples to Congress of two other resolved cases the Defense Department calls \"The Puerto Rico Objects\" and \"Mt. Etna,\" Kosloski described cases his office is still actively investigating, notably, an \"orange orb\" and \"a metallic cylinder.\"",
      "These cases are likely part of the 21 cases that the recently released annual unidentified aerial phenomena report said contain enough information and data for the office to actively investigate.",
      "One case was reported by a law enforcement officer \"out West\" who observed \"a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the ground,\" according to Kosloski.",
      "As the officer approached where he thought the orb would be, he saw \"a blacker than black object\" that was about the size of a Prius. When he reached a distance of 40-60 meters away from the object, it tilted 45 degrees and shot up vertically, traveling faster than any drone he had seen before.",
      "Just as it left his field of view, it emitted bright red and blue lights that lit up the inside of his vehicle \"as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside of his vehicle,\" Kosloski told Congress.",
      "Another case was reported from the southeastern part of the United States after two cars driven by government contractors left a facility around 9 a.m. and saw \"a large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane.\"",
      "After they observed it for 15-20 seconds, it disappeared.",
      "\"Obviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it's a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can't explain how that would happen,\" Kosloski said.",

      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.\u00a0The New York Times first reported on the alleged leak.",
      "Gaetz was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, though federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against him last year. The Ethics panel was looking into allegations the former congressman engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other accusations. But Gaetz resigned his seat in the House last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he had selected the Florida Republican to serve as his attorney general.",
      "Because Gaetz is no longer a House member, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him has ended.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came days before the ethics panel was set to convene to vote on whether to release a potentially damaging report detailing the findings of its investigation into the former congressman.",
      "The committee postponed the meeting, which was set for Friday, though two sources told CBS News that it is now set to gather Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against releasing the report on Gaetz, telling CNN on Sunday that the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.",
      "But some lawmakers, including in the Senate, have said the public should have access to it. Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that the panel's report should be made public and released to the Senate, which would vote after Trump takes office on whether to confirm Gaetz as attorney general.",
      "Wild said she believes the committee should vote on whether to disclose the report and estimates there is unanimous support from Democrats on the Ethics Committee to do so. But making the report public would require support from a majority of the panel, so at least one Republican would have to join their Democratic colleagues in voting to give the American people access.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said \"certain allegations merit continued review\" after it issued more than two dozen subpoenas and spoke with more than a dozen witnesses. The panel said it was looking into claims Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "The former congressman has denied any wrongdoing and has called the ethics investigation a \"smear.\" Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the Ethics Committee told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed\u00a0 Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

    "summary": "Trump has picked Howard Lutnick, a crypto enthusiast and the head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to be commerce secretary.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to be commerce secretary, a position in which he'd have a key role in carrying out Trump's plans to raise and enforce tariffs.",
      "Trump announced his pick Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "Lutnick is a co-chair of Trump's transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who was the Small Business Administration administrator in Trump's first administration. Both are tasked with putting forward candidates for key roles in the next administration.",
      "Lutnick has also donated millions to the effort to re-elect Trump and other Republicans. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump in August that raised $15 million and also gave $5 million to the Make America Great Again PAC, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Trump and his campaign worked to distance themselves from Project 2025 in the months leading up to Election Day, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals \"abysmal.\" Lutnick told CNBC he had read Project 2025 but had not met with any of its authors.",
      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk and others in Trump's orbit were calling on Trump to dump the previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in his post that \"Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:00:22 -0500",
    "summary": "As he gets ready to retire, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup often thinks about the day Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the House Republican leaders, was shot during a baseball practice.",
    "story": [
      "As Rep. Brad Wenstrup prepares for his retirement in six weeks, he often recalls one day in particular. He was prone on the ground, face down in the grass, with a baseball helmet on his head.",
      "The piercing sounds of screaming, gunfire and chaos surrounded him, persisting for several minutes. When it finally quieted, Wenstrup sprang to his feet and ran to his gravely injured colleague, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, a few hundred feet away.",
      "With each stride that day in June 2017, Wenstrup said he was consumed by the memories of Iraq from 12 years earlier. And as Wenstrup, a decorated combat surgeon, made his run along the field to provide help to his colleague, Wenstrup pictured the patient he and his surgical team were not able to save 12 years earlier.",
      "This time would be different, Wenstrup hoped.",
      "He not only helped save the patient, but along with emergency responders, played a key role in heading off a political assassination.",
      "Wenstrup, who was elected to Congress from suburban Cincinnati in 2012, helped treat Scalise, who had been shot by a gunman who opened fire at a House Republican baseball practice just before their 2017 annual congressional baseball game against Democrats.",
      "\"I saw the entry wound from the bullet, but I didn't see an exit wound, so I knew he was in trouble,\" Wenstrup said. \"I had no doubt he was bleeding internally. I knew that if I couldn't stop the bleeding, I at least needed to get him to drink fluids.\" He began applying pressure to slow the bleeding and talking to Scalise to keep him alert and conscious.",
      "Scalise had suffered a shot to his hip. His femur was shattered and his pelvis severely damaged.",
      "Scalise recalled some of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and of Wenstrup's care. He told CBS News, \"He was putting pressure on the spot where the bullet went in. He then ultimately put a tourniquet on. And you know, later, my trauma surgeon told me that tourniquet saved my life.\" Wenstrup had improvised a tourniquet with a belt and bandages to help slow the blood flow until Scalise was ushered away by emergency responders.",
      "After he was airlifted to George Washington University hospital for emergency surgery, Scalise would spend several days unconscious. Grueling rehabilitation and reconstructive surgeries helped Scalise walk again.",
      "With little fanfare last year, Wenstrup announced his retirement from Congress, which takes effect Jan. 3, 2025. Amid a wave of retirements of longtime members of Congress and a sea change in Washington after the 2024 elections, Wenstrup's departure has been overlooked by some.",
      "But not by Scalise or by many of Wenstrup's House colleagues.",
      "\"He's such a man of high integrity,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"He's respected by his colleagues. He's a chairman of a committee. He could have done even more things here in Congress, and his constituents would have elected him overwhelmingly. But he also knew it's time.\"",
      "The man who opened fire on Scalise and his fellow Republicans was killed after an exchange of gunfire with a Capitol Police protective detail assigned to Scalise, who was given an additional protection as a member of House leadership. Gunman James Hodgkinson acted alone and was not connected to terrorism, federal investigators determined. He was carrying an SKS rifle and a 9 mm handgun when he opened fire.",
      "Wenstrup is haunted by thoughts of the carnage that could have ensued if Scalise and the police unit had not been at the practice to protect the group.",
      "\"There were 136 rounds fired. I don't think most people know that,\" Wenstrup said. \"If Steve Scalise wasn't there and didn't take a bullet for all of us, then there's no (security) detail there.\" Wenstrup said the gunman could have killed 20 to 30 members of Congress and staff.\"",
      "As he performed the initial emergency medical triage on Scalise, Wenstrup recalled eerily similar images from 12 years earlier, when he was deployed as a military doctor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq in the months before the troop surge. One day, a soldier was grievously wounded nearby and was rushed to Wenstrup's post for surgery.",
      "Wenstrup said the victim was a servicemember who had likely been hit by an improvised explosive device. \u00a0 \"He was badly hit. There was no doubt about it, but he was still alive, and he was intubated and on the table,\" Wenstrup recalled, sitting back in his chair and lowering the volume of his voice as he shared the account.",
      "\"It was a blunt injury. There severed arteries internally and his blood pressure started dropping,\" Wenstrup said, \"We opened him up, went in and there was blood everywhere. And we couldn't stop. We couldn't stop it.\"",
      "\"We were just really distraught after that one,\" Wenstrup said. \"And that was going through my mind when I was with (Scalise) on that field.\"",
      "He urged arriving medics to rush an IV to Scalise, to ensure he stayed hydrated. The flashbacks to Iraq and 2005 continued. But this was different from that patient 12 years earlier, Wenstrup told himself. Scalise had not suffered the same blunt force trauma.",
      "In a 2018 interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Scalise recalled, \"In a weird way, your body kind of goes numb. You know, as bad as the wounds were, and obviously I know now how severe it was. At the time, I guess my body had been shutting down a lot of the real pain. And I was just thinking about what was going on at the moment.\"",
      "The surgeons who saved Scalise at the hospital would credit Wenstrup with effective care at the shooting site, Scalise said.",
      "Wenstrup's efforts to help save Scalise also had an untold impact on America, averting a would-be assassination and any cascading impact it would have inflicted upon the nation.",
      "Wenstrup said he and Scalise were casual acquaintances before the shooting. They later became friends \u2014 and roommates at a house in Washington, D.C., sharing a living quarters on days when Congress is in session.",
      "\"We are just very, very tight in our friendship,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"I've really gotten to know him and his wife. They're just wonderful people.\"",
      "Wenstrup's congressional career is ending amid uniquely toxic politics in the House. His departure comes as members of Congress complain of a loss of civility and cross-party relationships. Some of his Democratic colleagues told CBS News that Wenstrup's departure will deprive the House of another of its more civil members.",
      "\"People will miss Brad up here, including me,\" Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat told CBS News. \"He leads with his heart and cares about making things happen for the people he serves. I love the guy.\"",
      "But Wenstrup has engaged in some heated political battles, including in the closing months of his career. In June, a House subcommittee chaired by Wenstrup, held a charged and animated hearing questioning Dr. Anthony Fauci, focusing on Fauci's response to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Wenstrup accused Fauci of running an office that was \"unaccountable to the American people.\" Wenstrup's panel pursued Fauci's personal emails and staged a two-day, 14-hour closed door deposition that Wenstrup characterized as \"cordial\" but pressing.",
      "Democrats accused Wenstrup's subcommittee of spreading misinformation about Fauci. The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said in his opening statement, \"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years.\"",
      "Sitting at a small table in the lobby of his office suite in the Rayburn House Office Building, Wenstrup recalled his blistering testimony during hearings into the formation of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the Capitol siege.",
      "Wenstrup criticized Democratic leaders for not including a review of the baseball field shooting in the Jan. 6 committee's work. \"If the shooting killed 20 to 30 members of Congress, it would have changed the balance of power in the House of Representatives against the will of the people. That's an insurrection. You're throwing around that word? That's an insurrection, I said. So, if you're truly interested in protecting this beautiful Capitol and those who work in here, then we should make this part of this commission as well.\"",
      "Many of the other congressional Republicans who were on the field at the 2017 baseball practice shooting have long since departed, including those who were defeated in elections or retired. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who represented Florida, and former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona are among those who have left.",
      "Wenstrup's colleagues gave him a standing ovation on the House floor in September 2017, when Scalise returned to duties at the Capitol.",
      "But Wenstrup's retirement contributes to an unexpected dynamic. Among the officeholders from the shooting spree who are still in the House is the man who was hit. Scalise is expected to serve another term in 2025 as the House majority leader.",

      "The agency falls under the Department of Health and Human Services and oversees Medicare, the federal portion of the Medicaid program, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the federal health insurance marketplace. Trump has selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services. Both positions require Senate confirmation.",
      "\"America is facing a health care crisis, and there may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to make America healthy again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He is an eminent physician, heart surgeon, inventor, and world-class communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades.\"",
      "The president-elect said Oz will work with Kennedy, if he is confirmed, \"to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.\" He also indicated there may be cuts to CMS, writing that Oz \"will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"",
      "More than 100 million Americans participate in the major programs that CMS oversees \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP \u2014 according to the agency.",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

The plan to slow down the confirmations was orchestrated by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who was elected last week to serve as the next GOP leader, according to Fox News.",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement.",
      "Trump is also pushing Senate Republicans to thwart Democrats' efforts to continue approving Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the courts with radical left judges on their way out the door,\" he wrote on social media. \"Republican senators need to show up and hold the line \u2014 no more judges confirmed before inauguration day!\"",
      "But Democrats are not breaking new ground by confirming Mr. Biden's judicial nominees during the lame-duck session. In 2020, after Trump lost his bid for reelection, the GOP-led Senate confirmed 19 candidates to the federal bench, including one judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and four to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",
      "Among those who won approval in the weeks after the 2020 election was U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle, who at 33 years old was the youngest of Trump's nominees and was deemed \"not qualified\" to serve on the district court by the American Bar Association. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who tossed out the criminal case against Trump for his alleged mishandling of sensitive documents, was also confirmed by the Senate after the 2020 election.",
      "\"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2013 meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\" Andrew Bates, White House spokesperson, said of the efforts to gum-up the confirmation process. \"There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "Advocacy groups are pressuring Senate Democrats to continue to hold votes to approve all of the president's remaining nominees to the federal bench before Trump takes office in late January and Republicans claim the majority in the Senate.",
      "On Friday, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and 141 groups sent a letter to senators urging them to confirm all pending judicial nominees, calling it \"urgent and enduring.\"",
      "\"We implore you to stay in and do this necessary work,\" the organizations said. \"It is essential that we leave no judges behind.\"",
      "Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, also launched a campaign aimed at pressuring senators to green-light Mr. Biden's picks for the federal courts.",
      "\"With only weeks left before the new Congress, it's more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session to confirm the dozens of remaining fair-minded, qualified judges nominated by President Biden that the American people deserve,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of Demand Justice.",
      "Senate Democrats are unbowed by Republicans' efforts and have indicated they will charge ahead with confirming Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed Tuesday that Democrats \"are not done yet,\" and said his party will do what it can to \"get as many judges confirmed as we can.\"",
      "\"Everyone should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on nominations and get as many judges done as possible,\" the New York Democrat said, adding that Republicans \"can try dilatory tactics but we're going to persist, as we showed last night, as we're persisting now.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip who also chairs the Judiciary Committee, celebrated the judges brought forward by the committee over the last four years of Democratic control, noting that the vast majority of the judges that the Senate has considered are bipartisan, winning support from Republicans.",
      "But some Republicans didn't see them that way, such as Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who argued that many of Mr. Biden's nominees \"are not qualified to be on the federal bench\" and called them \"activists.\"",
      "Still, Senate Republicans acknowledge that they can't block the judicial picks across the board as Trump has requested. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, said that although Republicans would like to deliver on Trump's wishes, \"Democrats are in the majority, and even if we have all of our members here, we still can't prevent that, as long as they have all their members.\"",
      "\"So, we'll certainly try,\" Ricketts said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 15:55:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Martin O'Malley and Ken Martin have both jumped in the race for DNC chair, while others are exploring runs.",
    "story": [
      "Two candidates have officially launched their campaign to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, kicking off the race to determine who will lead the party's recovery after widespread losses in 2024.",
      "Martin O'Malley, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Governor, became the first notable figure to jump into the race on Monday. Ken Martin, who is the chair of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic party, and a DNC vice chair, announced his campaign Tuesday morning.",
      "Democrats are sifting through the fallout of the 2024 presidential election, where they not only lost the White House and control of the Senate but also failed to win back control of the House. The party finds itself without a clear leader and unified vision for the future, representing both a hurdle for the next DNC chair but also an opportunity to overhaul Democrats' approach with voters across the country in the coming years.",
      "Whoever the party's over 440 members elect to lead the party's national committee will be in charge of the party's top-level infrastructure, organizing and fundraising. And while DNC members tell CBS News that the eventual chair won't determine the widespread policy of the party, that person will serve as a notable mouthpiece to help craft the Democratic message.",
      "While the party itself was locked out of federal control after the elections, fundraising remained strong. As a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris raked in over $1 billion within the few months she was in the race. Her sum includes money raised by the DNC.",
      "Jamie Harrison, the current DNC chair, has said he would not seek reelection.",
      "The timeline for the election is not yet determined, though it will be addressed in a DNC Rules & Bylaws committee meeting on Dec. 12. DNC members expect the election itself to take place at their widespread member meeting before early spring 2025.",
      "In their launches, O'Malley and Martin both said prioritizing the party's message on the economy is essential. The state of the economy was a big issue that bolstered President-elect Donald Trump's return to office, according to a CBS News exit poll.",
      "\"When I'm traveling around the country, most people I chat with want the same things: to stay ahead on their bills, to give their families a better life and to live in safe and healthy communities. That's exactly what Democrats stand for, but we need to reconnect our ideas,\" Martin said in his campaign video.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a political strategist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and Sen-elect Ruben Gallego's campaign, told CBS News he is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair and has fielded calls from a handful of DNC members and nonprofits.",
      "Rocha said he's still waiting to see how the field develops before jumping in, and \"if there's a better candidate that really stands for what I want to see done with the party.\"",
      "But Rocha has set several action items he would take as chair: eliminate education requirements for senior DNC positions, mandating that state parties \"be more inclusive\" and diverse with consultant hiring, and to focus on building party infrastructure in all 50 states.",
      "Asked about Martin's and O'Malley's campaigns, Rocha called them \"names that are from the institution.\"",
      "\"I think we need somebody from the outside and a strategist to come in and rebuild the party,\" said Rocha, who noted that his non-college background and upbringing in East Texas could be an advantage as the party looks to reconnect with working-class voters.",
      "Other names that could potentially run include Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair according to a source familiar with his thinking.",
      "Rahm Emanuel, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor, is also mulling over a run according to Axios. But potentially choosing Emanuel, a polarizing figure in the Democratic party, has been panned by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups.",
      "Martin, a DNC member since he became a state party chair in 2011, may be the early favorite. Alan Clendenin, an executive DNC board member who is already supporting Martin, said he has \"a lot of friends in the DNC\" and pointed to relationships built from his time as President of the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC). Clendenin said Martin already has support from just under 100 DNC committee members.",
      "\"The party is in a place where we have to have someone who has a really solid understanding of existing party infrastructure. What's there, what's not there. People who have walked the walk. Talked the talk. People who have had to deal with the frustration of what's lacking and be able to understand what it takes to turn things around,\" Clendenin said about Martin and the chair position.",
      "Democrats' lack of success in 2024 could linger over any of the candidates in the race. While Minnesota has been a reliably blue state under Martin's watch, it's not seen as a presidential battleground state. But if Democrats wanted to gravitate towards someone from any of the seven presidential battlegrounds, the fact that the Harris-Walz ticket lost every one of them may prove to be a hindrance for a party incredibly eager to avoid a repeat performance in 2028.",
      "\"We just need to win,\" said one DNC member about the stakes of the chair race. \"We need to know who's coming with the game plan to make it happen\u2026 We don't make policy. We win elections, and we win presidential elections. That's our priority.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",
      "The seven-week trial ended with his conviction. The jury deliberated for less than two days.",
      "After hearing guilty 34 times, Trump turned around, clasped his son Eric's hand for a moment, and walked out of the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors were still packing their briefcases as Trump's voice could be heard from just beyond the doors.",
      "He was decrying the case, and campaigning for a return to the White House.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:35:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has selected for some of the top roles in his administration controversial picks who may not win universal support from Republican senators. He can only afford to lose a few Republicans in the confirmation process, but he's opened the door to the possibility of forgoing the traditional route altogether, utilizing a Constitutional power known as recess appointments to effectively bypass the Senate \u2014 and swiftly approve his nominees.",
      "The possible strategy, raised by Trump in a post on social media last week, has generated mixed reviews among senators, who would stand to forfeit their key advice and consent role. And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday as it faces increasing pressure to release a potentially damaging report detailing its investigation into allegations former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, two sources told CBS News.",
      "The movements of the Ethics panel have been under heightened scrutiny since President-elect Donald Trump announced last week that he had selected Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The Florida Republican resigned his seat in the House in the wake of the announcement, which ended the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz since he is now a former member.",
      "The Ethics Committee declined to comment on the upcoming meeting. The panel was supposed to meet Friday to vote on releasing the report, but Trump tapped Gaetz for the nation's top law enforcement officer days earlier. The committee then postponed its meeting.",
      "Gaetz must win Senate confirmation to serve as attorney general, and senators have been calling to see the Ethics Committee's report as they weigh whether to approve his nomination. Any confirmation hearings, which would be conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would not take place until next year after Trump is inaugurated. Republicans will gain control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins Jan. 3.",
      "Ethics Committee chairman Michael Guest told CBS News he spoke with Speaker Mike Johnson about his panel's report, but said Johnson did not try to weigh in on its release.",
      "\"He just wanted to let me know that he made a statement publicly and wanted me to be aware of that. And he reiterated that he believed that the report should not be released,\" Guest, a Republican from Mississippi, said.",
      "The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Susan Wild, said the report should be made public and \"certainly\" released to the Senate.",
      "\"I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,\" she told reporters Monday. \"There is precedent for releasing even after a member has resigned.\"",
      "Wild, of Pennsylvania, said she believes the committee should vote on whether to disclose the report and estimates there is unanimous support from Democrats to do so. But making the report public would require support from a majority of the committee, so at least one Republican would have to join their Democratic colleagues in voting to give the American people access.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters last week that he believes senators should have access to the Ethics Committee's findings.",
      "\"I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,\" said Cornyn, who sits on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Trump ally, similarly told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he believes the Senate should be able to see the report on Gaetz.",
      "\"Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I'm going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual, and at the end of the day, the Senate has to confirm him,\" he said.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against the release of the report by the Ethics Committee, warning in an interview Sunday that doing so for someone who is not a current House member \"would be a Pandora's box.\"",
      "\"What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,\" Johnson told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee first began its investigation into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the ethics probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He has called the investigation a \"smear.\" The Florida congressman helped lead the historic effort to strip McCarthy\u00a0of the speaker's gavel last year.",
      "The ethics panel said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation into Gaetz, and determined that \"certain allegations merit continued review.\"",
      "The committee said it was examining accusations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. The panel has the Florida Republican's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.

    "story": [
      "Austin, Texas \u2014 Texas public schools could use teachings from the Bible in lessons as an option for students from kindergarten through fifth grade under a proposal that drew hours of testimony Monday and follows Republican-led efforts in other states to incorporate more religious teaching into classrooms.",
      "Teachers and parents gave impassioned testimony for and against the curriculum plan at a meeting of the Texas State Board of Education, which is expected to hold a final vote on the measure later this week.",
      "The board heard from more than 150 people about the new proposed curriculum during more than eight hours of testimony, CBS Houston affiliate KHOU-TV reported.",
      "Testimony was expected to resume Tuesday, CBS Austin affiliate KEYE-TV said.",
      "The curriculum \u2014 designed by the state's public education agency \u2014 would allow teachings from the Bible such as the Golden Rule and lessons from books such as Genesis into classrooms. Under the plan, it would be optional for schools to adopt the curriculum though they would receive additional funding if they did so.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 21:45:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that Matt Gaetz paid them \"for sex,\" their lawyer told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
    "story": [
      "Two women interviewed by the House Ethics Committee about former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly in Venmo transactions \"for sex,\" and that those transactions were obtained by the committee, an attorney for the women told CBS News. The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women testified that Gaetz inquired in text messages about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties, which was understood to be code for drugs.",
      "Leppard, who is based in Orlando, said his clients testified that they attended parties from 2017 to January 2019 where Gaetz was present and sex and drug use took place. In an interview Monday with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, Leppard said one of his clients testified before the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl against a game table at a July 2017 party. Gaetz was sworn into Congress in January 2017, so all of the events the women allege took place while he was a member of the House.",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing, including having sex with a minor. After CBS News published its initial\u00a0story and it aired on \"CBS Evening News,\" Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer said in a statement, \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "\"The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing,\" Pfeiffer added, \"The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.\" Federal prosecutors did investigate Gaetz but ended the probe in 2023 without filing charges.",
      "As the House Ethics Committee weighs whether to release its report, which investigated allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and bribery, Leppard said his clients want the public to know they are telling the truth.",
      "One of his clients said in a text to Leppard, \"'Regardless of how many times he tries to distract from the truth, the public deserves to know that what we all experienced was real and actually happened.'\"",
      "\"My clients are not political; they didn't vote in the last two elections \u2014 they don't care one way or another,\" Leppard told Garrett. \"But they do want the public to know that they are not lying. They did not come forward willingly \u2014 they have never spoken to anyone without a force of a legal subpoena.\"",
      "He continued, \"And if the American people would know, then they could decide if that's the person they want to be the next attorney general.\"",
      "One of Leppard's clients is among at least four women who have told the committee they were paid to attend parties with drugs and sex where Gaetz was present, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Her account corroborates the testimony of the then-minor, who told the committee that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old.",
      "At the July 2017 party where his client alleges this occurred, Leppard said she and others were \"at the party in order to provide entertainment, to be happy, to be lively and provide sexual favors for the gentlemen that were present.\"",
      "\"The expectation was that they would have sexual intercourse,\" Leppard said his clients testified about these parties. \"They testified to the House that \u2014 and the House actually had their Venmo transactions, PayPal transactions, of Representative Gaetz.\"",
      "Leppard said the House panel asked the women about Gaetz's PayPal and Venmo transactions.",
      "\"'What was this for? What was this for,'\" Leppard said his clients were asked.",
      "\"'This was for sex,'\" he said they responded. \"'This was for sex. This was for sex.'\"",
      "Leppard said the payments were typically between $200 and $500 at a time.",
      "He said his clients also testified that sometimes, someone other than Gaetz would make a payment on his behalf. On at least one occasion, according to Leppard, that was Nestor Galban, a Cuban immigrant who is close to Gaetz and whom Gaetz has referred to as his \"son.\" He said other payments on Gaetz's behalf were made by Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg, who was convicted in 2022 of sex trafficking of a minor and other crimes.",
      "Leppard said his client who testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with the 17-year-old also told the panel she did not believe Gaetz was aware of her age at the time.",
      "\"My client, at least, testified that he did not know her age,\" Leppard said.",
      "Leppard's client testified that she knew the 17-year-old girl and her age, and said the two attended high school together.",
      "His client testified that she had sex with Gaetz after arriving at the July 2017 house party. Later during the party, his client testified, she was walking outside when she saw Gaetz having sex with her friend, the 17-year-old, against the gaming table.",
      "Leppard said one of his clients provided more than 100 texts involving Gaetz to the committee. Frequently, Leppard said, the texts his client provided showed Gaetz would have to be reminded to pay.",
      "\"There was a lot of texts requesting payment, like, 'Hey, when are you going to pay me?'\" Leppard said. \"Or, 'I don't want to be that girl, but can you please go ahead and pay me what we agreed upon?' Text messages along those lines. The texts the House was more interested in was the ones where Representative Gaetz was seemingly requesting that drugs be present.\"",
      "\"So, in my line of work as a criminal defense attorney, no one ever requests, 'Can you give me some drugs, please?'\" Leppard said. \"They usually use code words. And so Representative Gaetz would use terms like, 'Can you make sure that there are party favors present?' Or, 'Who's in charge of party favors?' He used the term 'party favor mecca' when he was referring to another individual who was bringing party favors. He also used the term 'vitamins,' I believe.\"",
      "Still, Leppard's clients told the House panel they could not specifically recall whether they had seen Gaetz use marijuana or other drugs.",
      "The texts also included a \"lot of positive emojis,\" Leppard said, like hearts, and \"positive statements\" back and forth between Gaetz, his clients and others. Leppard characterized the relationship with Gaetz as a complicated one, but also one of friendship, and he also told Garrett that his clients knew Gaetz's girlfriend at the time.",
      "\"At least one of my clients testified that, in a sense, they were required to please Mr. Gaetz before going out and attending their [Electronic Dance Music] show,\" Leppard said of one alleged occasion about which his client testified. \"And that was something that was of particular interest to the House. Representative Gaetz's girlfriend texted them, and they essentially took care of their duties, and later on, they went to see their show.\"",
      "Leppard said his clients have \"been through heck\" and are worried that if they testify before the Senate or anywhere else publicly, \"they might not be safe in their jobs.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee had planned to vote Friday, Nov. 15, on releasing its report, but the meeting was canceled after Trump announced his intention Wednesday to nominate Gaetz, and then a few hours later, the Florida Republican abruptly resigned from Congress. The panel is now set to meet Wednesday, two sources told CBS News.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday he would \"strongly request\" that the House Ethics Committee withhold the report on its investigation into Gaetz. The committee has equal representation among Democrats and Republicans \u2014 five Democrats and five Republicans.",
      "Democratic and Republican senators who would vote on Gaetz's confirmation as attorney general have said they want access to the ethics panel's report.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee for transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet.",
      "Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump's most visible defenders on cable news \u2014 a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is co-host of \"The Bottom Line\" on Fox Business.",
      "In his announcement, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him \"the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.\"",
      "Duffy is so far the second Fox-affiliated television host that Trump has named to his Cabinet. Trump last week announced his choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary.",
      "Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress \"to maintain and rebuild our Nation's Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!\"",
      "Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed to care for his nine children, including his youngest child who had a heart condition.",
      "He is a former lumberjack athlete and frequent Fox News contributor. He was featured on MTV's \"The Real World: Boston\" in 1997. He met his wife on the set of MTV's \"Road Rules: All Stars\" in 1998.",
      "A reality television background before politics is not unusual in Trump's world. The former president launched his political career after his hit reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"",
      "Duffy, after his time on reality television, worked as a special prosecutor and Ashland County district attorney. He won election to Congress as part of a tea party wave in 2010.",
      "When he first ran for office, Duffy was largely considered an underdog but attracted national attention for his campaign ads, in which he donned a red flannel shirt and chopped trees. He told voters he came from a \"long line of lumberjacks\" and would bring his axe to Washington.",
      "He served until resigning in 2019.",
      "The Transportation Department oversees the nation's complex transportation system, including pipelines, railroads, cars, trucks, the airlines and mass transit systems as well as federal funding for highways.",
      "If confirmed, Duffy would take over at a time of tremendous change, especially on the nation's highways. Traffic deaths remain near record highs at a time when new technologies are being introduced that could help make the roads safer. Multiple companies are deploying autonomous robotaxis and even driverless semis with no specific federal regulations. And the nascent move from gasoline to electric vehicles presents safety problems of its own, especially with battery fires that can be difficult to extinguish.",
      "The department includes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates automakers, including Elon Musk's Tesla. The department sets fuel economy standards for cars and trucks and regulates the airline industry through the Federal Aviation Administration, which is grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers to ensure the safe and orderly flow of air travel.",
      "Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of Airlines for America, said the association was \"thrilled\" by the choice of Duffy.",
      "\"Congressman Duffy has a proven track record for getting things done, and we are eager to collaborate with him on key issues impacting the U.S. airline industry,\" Calio said.",
      "Trump has criticized electric vehicles as expensive and unreliable and called President Joe Biden's policy to promote them \"lunacy. He also has said EV manufacturing will destroy auto industry jobs and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don't work in cold weather and are unable to travel long distances.",
      "Trump has softened his rhetoric about electric vehicles in recent months after Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.",
      "Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars, and a tax credit for EV purchases is reportedly among those the Trump administration may seek to eliminate next year.",
      "Trump, in his statement, said Duffy would \"prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America's highways, tunnels, bridges and airports.\" Trump, as he campaigned for the White House, would sometimes complain about the state of air travel in particular, lamenting that the nation's \"once-revered airports\" are a \"dirty, crowded mess.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s concerns about the health effects of fluoride may already be helping some Americans \u2014 investors in dental services companies.",
      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "According to\u00a0KFF Health News, some studies have linked fluoride exposure among pregnant women to a higher risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and lower IQs, leading experts to call for further research.",

    "summary": "Kennedy insists he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but he has a long record of false and misleading statements\u200b about their safety and benefits. What could he do as Trump's HHS secretary?",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could wield significant authority to directly affect how and whether Americans get vaccines\u00a0nationwide, current and former federal health officials say, if he is confirmed next year to head the Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The position would grant Kennedy authority over efforts like the Vaccines for Children program, which is estimated to have saved 1.1 million lives by immunizing children against diseases like polio and measles that are now rare thanks to the shots.",
      "Many public health experts have decried the pick, saying Kennedy's past claims about vaccines are disqualifying.",
      "\"A serious candidate for this position would follow the decades of real-world evidence that shows that vaccines are safe and prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year,\" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Monday in a statement.",
      "Is RFK Jr. anti-vaccine?",
      "Kennedy has insisted he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and promised not to try to ban the shots under the Trump administration \u2014 but he has a long record of making misleading statements about vaccines and fanning doubts about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "He wrote a now-retracted article in 2005 falsely claiming autism was linked to a discontinued ingredient in vaccines, and continues to say he thinks vaccines are a cause of autism, which decades of scientific research has thoroughly discredited.",
      "On social media, Kennedy called COVID shots \"a crime against humanity\" and claimed children did not need COVID vaccines. (Research\u00a0estimates\u00a0that COVID vaccines prevented 3.2 million deaths in the U.S. through 2022.)",
      "The group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, has been denounced by experts for being among the most prolific spreaders of misinformation about vaccines.",
      "In recent months, Kennedy has\u00a0said his goal is to \"provide Americans with transparency and access to all the data so they can make informed choices.\" He also wants to clean house at federal health agencies, ousting \"corrupt\" officials he claims have clouded \"their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\"",
      "The head of the FDA's vaccines program says he hopes Kennedy will \"keep an open mind\" about what the science shows.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said earlier this month.",
      "CDC recommendations and covering costs",
      "One of the biggest roles that the CDC plays in vaccinations is in deciding which vaccines health insurers are required to cover. Nearly all plans are required by law to cover routine shots that are recommended by the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "Updating that \"schedule\" of routinely recommended vaccines is usually a monthslong process for the committee, which is made up of medical experts who work to publicly analyze and vote on the benefits and risks of different shots.",
      "Those meetings happen at least three times every year, as the committee debates newly approved vaccines, annual updates to routine shots like influenza or COVID-19 and reevaluating the data on older immunizations.",
      "\"They incorporate epidemiology. Which groups are most affected? Are there certain subgroups that it is most effective for? Are there some groups that may not benefit very much from a certain vaccine,\" said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations.",
      "Bridges, who now works as a consultant on adult vaccinations, praised the \"very public discussion and often very rigorous debate\" among the experts selected to serve on the committee.",
      "The CDC's career civil servants are traditionally able to offer input into which experts are chosen for the panel, and federal law says the committee's membership should be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view.\"",
      "But, it will be Kennedy's decision alone to decide who sits on the committee. Kennedy's pick to head the CDC would also have the authority to override the panel's votes, as was done in 2021 to roll out some COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations have a wide impact beyond insurance coverage, Bridges said, influencing how doctors and local health departments talk about and offer the shots.",
      "Kennedy and his pick to head the CDC could also affect the agency's wide-ranging immunization work in other ways.",
      "For example, the agency is responsible for the Vaccines for Children program that supplies shots to pediatricians nationwide to ensure no-cost access for uninsured children. It also routinely steps in to sort out any confusion among providers over vaccine recommendations.",
      "The CDC also runs the main national data sources tracking immunization rates, vaccine effectiveness for some common shots and ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety.",
      "\"It's really the integration of all of those things. There's a lot that goes into this \u2014 the policy, the monitoring, the coordination, the communication,\" Bridges said.",
      "FDA approvals and regulations",
      "Kennedy and whoever he picks to lead the FDA would also play a big role in both the approval of vaccines and in regulating them after they are on the market.",
      "Decisions on whether to approve or reject applications from vaccine makers are traditionally left up to career scientists working in the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That is mostly ensured only by norms, not law.",
      "\"It's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. And so, that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between the political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said Nov. 11, speaking at an event hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research.",
      "Califf said that \"99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products\" are made by civil servants with scientific expertise in the field. But the commissioner is sometimes forced to step in, like to resolve internal disagreements or appeals from outside the agency.",
      "Kennedy and his FDA commissioner could also influence vaccines in other ways, like through guidance the agency issues to manufacturers seeking approval.",
      "Policy changes recommended by the agency's staff can be stalled or rejected by political leaders. Major changes to FDA's rules are also funneled through the White House, which has the ability to block them.",
      "\"There's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it,\" Califf said.",
      "Communicating risks and benefits",
      "Beyond Kennedy's direct authority over vaccines, another major way he and his picks to head the CDC and FDA could influence public opinion is through how they approach talking to Americans about the risks and benefits of vaccines.",
      "The department funds a number of efforts to survey public confidence in vaccines and study ways to improve it. They also run a number of campaigns to promote recommended shots, like advertising about the annual COVID-19 and flu vaccines or helping health departments respond to backsliding immunization rates in schools.",
      "\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" said Bridges, citing a polio case that emerged in New York in 2022.",
      "Outbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.",
      "The return of polio prompted an investigation by health authorities and a renewed push for vaccinations, though officials acknowledged they struggled to \"meaningfully increase\" immunization coverage.",
      "\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold,\" said Bridges.",
      "Another way the communications role comes up is in navigating how to explain potential risks flagged by federal vaccine safety systems to doctors and the public.",
      "An example last year came after the FDA and CDC officials worked to craft a bulletin disclosing early concerns that COVID-19 shots might be increasing the risk of stroke for seniors, while also explaining why the preliminary \"safety signal\" did not warrant stopping use of the shots.",
      "Intense scrutiny of the issue by the U.S. and health authorities overseas eventually found \"no evidence of a safety concern,\" though health authorities continue to closely study the issue.",
      "The benefits of the vaccine continue to far outweigh this theoretical risk, the CDC's advisers concluded, especially among seniors who are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID.",
      "\"The current evidence does not support the existence of a safety issue. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data as they are available and update the public as needed,\" the FDA said.",

    "story": [
      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",
      "World Wildlife Fund-Australia's head of oceans, Richard Leck, said the initial surveys confirmed his \"worst fears.\"",
      "\"The Great Barrier Reef can bounce back but there are limits to its resilience,\" he said. \"It can't get repeatedly hammered like this. We are fast approaching a tipping point.\"",
      "Leck added the area surveyed was \"relatively small\" and feared that when the full report was released next year \"similar levels of mortality\" would be observed.",
      "He said the findings reinforced Australia's need to commit to stronger emission reduction targets of at least 90 percent below 2005 levels by 2035 and move away from fossil fuels.",
      "The country is one of the world's largest gas and coal exporters and has only recently set targets to become carbon neutral.",

    "summary": "Scientists say they've discovered a \"mega coral\" three times bigger than the previous record holder - so huge they initially thought it was a shipwreck.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",
      "\"We want the world to know, that this is a special place, and it needs to be protected,\" he told the BBC. \"We rely mostly on marine resources for economic survival, so coral is very, very important.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump was on hand with Elon Musk for the sixth test flight of SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

Previous studies, including data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, suggested the far side might also have a volcanic past. The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",
      "The results were published Friday in the journal Science.",
      "China has launched several spacecraft to the moon. In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",

      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",

Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",

      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly.

The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",

    "title": "Here's what Trump's FCC pick, Brendan Carr, wrote in Project 2025",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "summary": "In an online conversation about aging adults, Google's Gemini AI chatbot responded with a threatening message, telling the user to \"please die.\"",
    "story": [
      "A college student in Michigan received a threatening response during a chat with Google's AI chatbot Gemini.",
      "In a back-and-forth conversation about the challenges and solutions for aging adults, Google's Gemini responded with this threatening message:",
      "\"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\"",
      "Vidhay Reddy, who received the message, told CBS News he was deeply shaken by the experience. \"This seemed very direct. So it definitely scared me, for more than a day, I would say.\"",
      "The 29-year-old student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who said they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"",
      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" she said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",
      "Her brother believes tech companies need to be held accountable for such incidents. \"I think there's the question of liability of harm. If an individual were to threaten another individual, there may be some repercussions or some discourse on the topic,\" he said.",
      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",
      "While Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.",
      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.",
      "Google said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.",
      "However, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs. The mother of a 14-year-old Florida teen, who died by suicide in February, filed a lawsuit against another AI company, Character.AI, as well as Google, claiming the chatbot encouraged her son to take his life.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:21:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Susan Smith, convicted of killing her two sons by rolling her car into a lake in 1994, broke down in tears while making her case to the parole board.",
    "story": [
      "A parole board decided unanimously Wednesday that Susan Smith should remain in prison, despite her plea that God has forgiven her for infamously killing her two young sons 30 years ago by rolling her car into a South Carolina lake while they were strapped in their car seats.",
      "It was the first parole hearing for Smith, 53, who is serving a life sentence after a jury convicted her of murder but decided to spare her the death penalty. She is eligible for a parole hearing every two years now that she has spent 30 years behind bars.",
      "Smith made her case by video link from prison. She started by saying she was \"very sorry,\" then broke down in tears and bowed her head.",
      "\"I know what I did was horrible,\" Smith said, pausing and then continuing with a wavering voice. \"And I would give anything if I could go back and change it.\"",
      "In her final statements, Smith said God has forgiven her. \"I ask that you show that same kind of mercy, as well,\" she said.",
      "Smith made international headlines in 1994 when she insisted for nine days that a carjacker drove away with her sons. Prosecutors have long argued that Smith killed 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex because she believed they were the reason the wealthy son of the owner of the business where she worked broke off their affair. Her attorneys blame her mental health.",
      "A group of about 15 people urged against parole. They included her ex-husband and the father of the boys, David Smith; his family members; prosecutors; and law enforcement officials. Along with a few others, David Smith had a photo of Michael and Alex pinned to his suit jacket.",
      "He struggled to get out words at first, pausing several times to compose himself. He said he has never seen Susan Smith express remorse toward him. \"She changed my life for the rest of my life that night,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm asking that you please, deny her parole today, and hopefully in the future, but specifically today,\" he said, adding that he plans to attend each parole hearing to make sure Michael and Alex aren't forgotten.",
      "A decision to grant parole requires a two-thirds vote of board members present, according to the state. Parole in South Carolina is granted only about 8% of the time and is less likely with an inmate's first appearance before the board, in notorious cases, or when prosecutors and the families of victims are opposed.",
      "Before Smith testified, she listened stoically to a statement from her attorney, Tommy Thomas. He called her situation one about \"the dangers of untreated mental health.\" He also noted she had no criminal history before her conviction, making her \"low risk\" to the public.",
      "The board's decision was the one David Smith had hoped for, Smith said in a news conference following the hearing. \"In two more years, we'll go through this again,\" he said. \"But at least I know, for now, she'll still be behind bars.\"",
      "The family and prosecution had been \"cautiously optimistic,\" former prosecutor Tommy Pope said, because Susan Smith has continually demonstrated that it's \"always been about Susan.\"",
      "A true-crime touchstone",
      "Smith had claimed in October 1994 that she was carjacked late at night near the city of Union and that a Black man wearing a toboggan hat drove away with her sons. The claims by Smith, who is white, played into a centuries-old racist trope of Black men being a danger to white women and stoked concerns about crime that were prevalent in 1990s America and remain so today.",
      "For nine days, Smith made numerous and sometimes tearful pleas asking that Michael and Alex be returned safely. The whole time, the boys were in Smith's car at the bottom of nearby John D. Long Lake, authorities said.",
      "Investigators said Smith's story didn't add up. Carjackers usually just want a vehicle, so investigators asked why they would let Smith out but not her kids. The traffic light where Smith said she had stopped when her car was taken would only be red if another car was waiting to cross, and Smith said no other cars were around. Other bits and pieces of the story did not make sense.",
      "Smith ultimately confessed to letting her car roll down a boat ramp and into the lake. A re-creation by investigators showed it took six minutes for the Mazda to dip below the surface, while cameras inside the vehicle showed water pouring in through the vents and steadily rising. The boys' bodies were found dangling upside-down in their car seats, one tiny hand pressed against a window.",
      "The 1995 trial of the young mother became a national sensation and a true-crime touchstone.",
      "Smith's lawyers said she was remorseful, was suffering a mental breakdown and intended to die alongside her children but left the car at the last moment. They were successful at sparing her life.",
      "\"I just felt strongly that had the Black man with the toboggan committed the crime, people would expect the death penalty,\" Pope said at Wednesday's hearing. \"If David Smith had committed the crime, people would have expected the death penalty.\"",
      "Pain to family, state and nation",
      "The parole board asked Smith about the law enforcement resources used to try to locate her children. In reply, she told the board she was \"just scared\" and \"didn't know how to tell them.\"",
      "Smith's crime traumatized not only her family, prosecutor Kevin Brackett said, but also people in South Carolina and around the country who \"fixated\" on this \"global sensation.\" Her allegation that a Black man kidnapped her children also led to other Black men being wrongfully pulled over as police searched for a \"fictitious man,\" he said.",
      "From prison, Smith can make phone calls and answer text messages, many from journalists and interested men. Those messages and phone calls were released under South Carolina's open records act, something Smith didn't initially realize could happen. She said the invasion of her privacy upset her, along with the public revelation that she was juggling conversations about the future with several men.",
      "Some men know why she is famous. Others are more coy. One told her he was going to use the dates of her birthday and those of her dead sons when he played the Powerball lottery. Others chatted about their lives and sports. Many promised her a home on the outside and a happy life.",
      "Smith also had sex with guards. And she violated prison policies by giving out contact information for friends, family members and her ex-husband to a documentary producer who discussed paying her for her help, according to Pope, the former prosecutor. CBS affiliate WLTX-TV reported Smith was found guilty at an internal hearing on October 3 and lost her phone, tablet, and canteen privileges for 90 days.",
      "Pope, who's now a representative in the South Carolina legislature,\u00a0told WLTX-TV\u00a0earlier that he didn't expect Smith to get parole \u2014 or want her to.",
      "\"She has been continually focused on Susan, not on Michael and Alex, I think Susan's remorseful, but remorseful that she's in her circumstances \u2014 not remorseful for the pain she caused Michael and Alex, or equally importantly David Smith (the boy's father) and his family,\" he said."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

      "The state had charged Ibarra with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence, and being a \"peeping Tom.\" That final charge stemmed from prosecutors' allegation that Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university residential building on the day Riley was murdered. Prosecutors said he was \"hunting for females on the University of Georgia's campus\" when he encountered Riley.",
      "Ibarra was found guilty on all 10 counts. Audible wails were heard in the courtroom when Haggard announced the verdict, citing a portion of the prosecution's closing argument that emphasized the evidence against Ibarra was \"overwhelming and powerful.\" The defendant, receiving the news in Spanish through a translator, maintained the stoicism he displayed in court throughout the trial.",
      "Haggard heard impact statements from Riley's loved ones after reading the verdict. Her parents, sister, roommates and friends spoke through tears while they described Riley as a cheerful, ambitious and generous young person who valued her faith and prioritized helping others. Many called Ibarra a monster and the crime an act of evil, and Riley's classmates said separately they now fear for their safety at school. The prosecution also shared excruciating video of the moment police told Riley's family she was dead.",
      "Everyone who gave statements pressed the judge to impose the maximum sentence. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in this case.",
      "\"There is no end to the pain, suffering and loss that we have experienced or will continue to endure,\" said Riley's mother, Allyson Phillips, in her remarks. \"This sick, twisted and evil coward showed no regard for Laken or human life. We are asking the same be done to him.\"",
      "Riley was found dead on Feb. 22 in a wooded part of the University of Georgia campus in Athens, where she was enrolled in the Augusta University College of Nursing. The 22-year-old had gone for a run that morning through the school's intramural fields, which was routine for her, and a concerned friend called University of Georgia police at around noon once Riley failed to return. She often talked to her mother on the phone while out running in the mornings, so when Riley's friends and family did not hear from her, they worried something was wrong.",
      "Phillips\u00a0called and texted her daughter several times after missing an initial call from Riley just after 9 a.m., according to logs and messages pulled from the student's phone and shown in court Tuesday, as the state's case wound down. Phillips and other family members continued to reach out to Riley for several hours when she did not reply.",
      "Phillips cried at the Tuesday hearing as her text messages were read aloud on the stand by Georgia Police Sgt. Sophie Raboud, one of the lead investigators in Riley's case. In one of her final messages to Riley at 11:47 a.m., her mother wrote, \"You're making me nervous not answering while you're out running. Are you OK?\"",
      "Riley's mother, along with family and friends in attendance, became emotional at a different point in Raboud's testimony where she answered questions about the video being played of Riley running the morning of her death.",
      "Ibarra was arrested the following day and booked without bond in the Athens-Clarke County Jail. Police have said Riley's killing appeared to be a random attack. But the indictment returned by a Georgia grand jury in May detailed a gruesome confrontation in which Ibarra allegedly asphyxiated the student, hit her over the head with a rock to the point of disfiguring her skull, and pulled up her clothing, intending to rape her.",
      "In court, attorneys for the state also described a disturbing scene. Prosecutor Sheila Ross said Friday that Ibarra killed Riley violently after a prolonged struggle.",
      "\"When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,\" Ross told the judge. She said evidence \u2014 including surveillance footage, traces of Ibarra's DNA under Riley's fingernails, and his thumbprint left behind on her phone screen \u2014 would show the student \"fought for her life, for her dignity\" over almost 20 minutes.",
      "Data from Riley's watch indicated she stopped suddenly in the middle of her run at around 9:10 a.m. the day she died and called 911 about a minute later. The watch showed Riley's heart was still beating until 9:28 a.m., Ross said.",
      "Ibarra's defense attorney, Dustin Kirby, had argued the prosecution's evidence against his client was circumstantial and did not prove his guilt. Ibarra has appeared in court with shackles around his ankles and headphones to follow a translation of the trial proceedings in Spanish.",
      "\"The evidence in this case is very good that Laken Riley was murdered,\" Kirby said. Still, the defense has tried to challenge the strength of the prosecution's evidence, saying even the DNA sample may not completely rule out other suspects. Ibarra's legal team raised questions, for example, about whether one of his brothers could have committed the crime. The defendant's brother Diego Ibarra worked a shift at the University of Georgia's dining hall on the day of the murder.",
      "Witness testimony for the prosecution continued into Monday, when an FBI Special Agent James Burnie told the court that electronic location data seemed to place Riley and Ibarra in the same wooded area at the time of her death. GPS coordinates from Riley's cellphone and smartwatch confirmed her precise location in the area where officers found her body, and pings between Ibarra's phone and cell towers suggested he was likely in the woods, too, Burnie said.",
      "Prosecutors during that hearing also played a recording for the court of a May phone call between Ibarra's wife, Layling Franco, and Ibarra while he was in jail. On the call, Ibarra told Franco he had been looking for work at the University of Georgia, and his wife urged him multiple times to tell her the truth about what happened to Riley, FBI specialist Abeisis Ramirez said during his testimony. The recording of their conversation was translated from Spanish for the court.",
      "The jail call was not admitted into evidence in Ibarra's trial and could not be considered in the case, Judge Haggard announced Tuesday morning.",
      "\"After hearing the translations I do find that it was more than contextual, and therefore violates the confrontation clause of the 6th Amendment,\" the judge said. The clause protects the rights of an individual accused of a crime to confront witnesses.",

      "These AI-generated videos are hardly perfect, but they just need to be convincing enough to deceive an unsuspecting victim.",

      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",

      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",

Matt Gaetz is meeting with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he seeks to shore up support for his nomination for attorney general amid calls for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Accompanied by Vice President-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, Gaetz is sitting down with Republican senators, whose votes will be crucial in confirming him to the position of the nation's top law enforcement officer next year. The GOP is set to take control of the Senate in the next Congress and hold 53 seats, but Gaetz will need backing from a majority of the chamber to win confirmation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for attorney general last week, after which the Florida Republican resigned his seat from Congress. But the selection and Gaetz's resignation came two days before the House Ethics Committee was poised to meet and vote on whether to make public its report detailing the findings of its long-running investigation into allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "The Republican has denied wrongdoing and called the Ethics probe a \"smear.\" He has blamed the investigation on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom\u00a0Gaetz helped oust last year.

He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",

He said he expects Gaetz to meet with all 53 incoming Republicans over the coming weeks.",
      "\"President Trump is very committed to moving this forward. And I know there's been some speculation among my colleagues that maybe this wouldn't actually go to a confirmation hearing, but they want one, and I think they're absolutely entitled to have that,\" he said. \"Gaetz wants the opportunity to testify, to respond to critics, answer questions, talk about his vision for the department.\"",
      "Hawley is likely to vote for all of Trump's nominees, he said, and believes there will be \"no shortage of information\" about Gaetz available for senators.",
      "At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she has not been asked to meet with Gaetz yet. Collins is among the most moderate members of the conference, and her vote could be critical to Gaetz's confirmation. She previously said she was \"shocked\" by his selection.",
      "After his meeting with Gaetz, Graham said that while he tends to defer to presidential Cabinet choices \"unless the evidence suggests disqualification,\" the process for Trump's selections \"will not be a rubber stamp, nor will it be driven by a lynch mob.\"",

      "\"There were a lot of allegations thrown at Brett Kavanaugh that turned out to be uncorroborated in many, many instances,\" Lee said. \"And so I do think that is something of a voice of warning people ought to take. Just because allegations are made, and just because people talk a lot about them \u2014 and sometimes in a fit of politically driven eagerness to embrace them, assume their\u00a0 truth \u2014 doesn't mean that they are, in fact, true.\"",
      "Kavanaugh was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct decades earlier and vehemently denied the accusations. The Judiciary Committee held a set of extraordinary hearings that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he assaulted her during a party when they were in high school in the 1980s. Classmates who were at the party, however, could not corroborate Ford's allegations. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote, the narrowest margin in more than a century.",
      "Gaetz has been under investigation for several years by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, which looked into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation. It said in a rare statement that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, among those the claims of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts, giving \"special privileges and favors\" and obstructing government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS news at the time that four women testified to the Ethics panel that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs.

      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:59:37 -0500",
    "summary": "For many students, Athens, Georgia, no longer feels like the safe haven they once thought it was, after the killing of Laken Riley.",
    "story": [
      "Just two blocks from the University of Georgia campus, in a downtown courtroom in Athens, Georgia, a judge on Wednesday found Jose Ibarra guilty of murder in the death of 22-year-old Laken Riley, a former UGA student who transferred to the nursing program at Augusta University's Athens campus.",
      "In late February, Riley was attacked during her morning jog on a trail near the University of Georgia's intramural fields. As the investigation and trial unfolded, members of the Athens community grappled with a shaken sense of security.",
      "\"Just because we're on campus doesn't mean, necessarily, that the bad parts of the world can't get in,\" said Allison Mawn, a fourth-year student. \"She did everything right. She told friends where she was going, she went on a popular trail during the day. She had her tracking location on. She even managed to call for help, and still it wasn't enough.\"",
      "The case was thrust into the national spotlight when authorities arrested Ibarra, an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant who entered the country two years ago, and charged him with murdering Riley. In the midst of the election cycle, her death quickly became a flashpoint in the immigration debate, with former President Donald Trump and his supporters\u00a0raising it at rallies and President Biden responding\u00a0to heckling about it in his State of the Union address.",
      "\"In an instant, all the eyes across the country are on us,\" said Mawn. \"Now you can't say the name Laken Riley without thinking about undocumented immigrants and illegal immigration.\"",
      "Students have organized vigils and prayer groups, and participated in protests, rallies and runs in memory of Riley. A GoFundMe set up by her family amassed over $250,000 in donations that will go to the Laken Hope Foundation, an organization that will \"promote safety awareness for women, aid and tuition assistance for nursing students, and children's healthcare\u2026 all causes that Laken felt strongly about.\"",
      "For many students, Athens no longer feels like the safe haven they once thought it was. To ease fears, University of Georgia President Jere Morehead announced a $7.3 million campus safety initiative. The campus has been fortified by an expanded university police force, hundreds of additional lights and security cameras and multiple emergency call stations and license plate readers.",
      "Over the past months, \"there was an expectation that we would magnify those efforts,\" said P. Daniel Silk, the University of Georgia's associate vice president for public safety. \"We want to be more safe and more secure tomorrow than we were yesterday.\"",
      "While the Athens community waited for justice to be delivered, students continued to bustle around campus, walking under the newly installed street lights, passing by additional emergency call systems and easing into a heightened security presence. Classes may go on, but the campus and community are changed.",
      "\"Regardless of what the verdict is, unfortunately we still lost a student. We still lost a life and nothing's gonna change that,\" said Mawn. \"Things are never going to be a hundred percent the same for any of us here.\"",

    "summary": "Americans struggling to stay financially afloat should consider debt relief before tapping into retirement accounts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "No one wants to file for bankruptcy, but if you're heading in that direction, delaying the inevitable may only make things worse.",
      "Bankruptcies are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but have gone up relative to last year. Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "Barbara Mahoney, a NOAA biologist examining the whale, told the Anchorage Daily News the whale was likely 1 to 3 years old.",
      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons.

      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",

      "Army veteran Anthony Anderson, who runs \"Guardians of Valor,\" a popular social media website that investigates service member records, told CBS News that Williams' claims are a \"slap in the face of people who have earned the title of Marine.\"",
      "\"Boot camp for the Marine Corps is not an easy task. To call yourself a Marine, you have to go through at least 13 weeks of boot camp and successfully navigate the crucible \u2026 people have died in training at boot camp trying to earn the title of Marine,\" said Anderson.",

      "Zhytomyr, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine braced Wednesday for possible Russian retaliation after firing American-made and supplied missiles into Russia the previous day. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv closed its doors on Wednesday and warned there were indications Russia was poised to launch a possible \"significant air attack\" on Ukraine.",
      "Exactly 1,000 days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighboring nation, Ukrainian forces fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russian territory on Tuesday, U.S. officials have confirmed to CBS News. It was the first time Ukrainian forces had taken advantage of President Biden's easing of restrictions over the weekend on Ukraine's use of the U.S.-supplied missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russia.",
      "Ukraine's military said it hit a Russian weapons depot in Bryansk early Tuesday, but it didn't say what weapons were used.",
      "In the immediate wake of the strike on Bryansk, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv warned Americans in Ukraine to exercise extra caution in the weeks ahead and to stockpile food.",
      "On Wednesday, the embassy followed up with a formal security alert saying it had \"received specific information of a potential significant air attack\" by Russia, possibly within hours.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,\" the alert said, adding that U.S. nationals in the country should be \"prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.\"",
      "A Ukrainian military official told CBS News on Wednesday that the country had information suggesting the Russians could try to strike the center of Kyiv with ballistic missiles. Soon after, air raid sirens blared across Kyiv and other major cities, forcing thousands of people to seek shelter underground before the alert was lifted.",
      "In a statement carried by state media, Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday the military had shot down five ATACMS fired by Ukraine and damaged another. The reports said fragments had fallen at or near a military facility and that some of the debris had ignited a fire, but the ministry said there was no damage or casualties.",
      "According to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the ATACMS are a \"long-range, guided missile that gives commanders the immediate firepower to shape the battlespace.\" Each of the weapons can carry a fragmentation warhead of up to 500 pounds, with a maximum range of 300 kilometers, or about 186 miles.",

      "The Ukrainian strike on Russia's western Bryansk region came hours after another Ukrainian residential neighborhood was left charred and smoking.

That strike came a day after another strike on the power grid in Odesa, which also destroyed several homes.",

      "Oleksandra Ustinova, a member of Ukraine's parliament who says she helped lobby the U.S. government to let Ukraine use the ATACMS deep inside Russia, told CBS News the strike on Bryansk helped demonstrate \"that these are legitimate targets, and that they're very important to protect our civilian population and our armed forces.\"",
      "Mr. Biden only agreed to Ukraine's long-sought permission to fire ATACMS into Russia on Sunday. He had been worried that such a decision could escalate the conflict.",
      "But the Kremlin has appeared less concerned about stoking fears of an escalation. Putin formally approved a change in Russia's nuclear doctrine Tuesday, lowering the threshold for a potential nuclear strike.",

    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved changes formally lowering the threshold at which his country can consider a nuclear attack.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin approved changes to his country's nuclear doctrine this week, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Russia would consider using its nuclear weapons. Moscow announced Tuesday that Putin had signed off on the changes to the doctrine, formally known as \"The basics of state policy in the field of nuclear deterrence,\"  as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia using U.S.-supplied missiles.",
      "The updated doctrine states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both. That means any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group.",
      "Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "U.S. officials said Ukraine fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia's Bryansk region early Tuesday, just a couple days after President Biden gave Ukraine permission to fire the weapons deeper into Russian territory. ATACMS are powerful weapons with a maximum range of almost 190 miles.",
      "\"This is the latest instance of a long string of nuclear rhetoric and signaling that has been coming out of Moscow since the beginning of this full scale invasion,\" Mariana Budjeryn, Senior Research Associate at Harvard's Belfer Center, told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the change to Russia's nuclear doctrine was first proposed last month.",
      "\"The previous version of the Russian doctrine adopted in 2020 allowed also a nuclear response to a large-scale conventional attack, but only in extreme circumstances where the very survival of the state was at stake,\" Budjeryn noted. \"This formulation has changed to say, well, extreme circumstances that jeopardize the sovereignty of Russia. Well, what does that really mean and who defines what serious threats to sovereignty might constitute?\"",
      "Budjeryn said Russia had already used weapons against Ukraine that could carry a nuclear payload.",
      "\"Russia has been using a number of delivery systems of missiles that [can] also come with a nuclear warhead. So these are dual capable systems.

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "Mani details the grim reality faced by millions of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, which drew the attention of Lawrence in 2021.",
      "\"My first reaction when watching that was to do what the Taliban did not want us to do, which was give access and facilities to the people on the ground to capture what was happening on the ground in real-time,\" she said. \"Because obviously the Taliban flourishes in secrecy.\"",
      "Some of the strict limitations imposed on women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule include prohibiting women from working, pursuing education, or even leaving their homes without a male escort. They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me. How can you stop a girl from her school? They come up with these excuses that it's culture, it's religion. There is no culture, excuse. The true representatives of that culture are the Afghan women and girls that we've seen in the documentary.\"",
      "The documentary follows three Afghan women who secretly filmed their protests.

Police said Marius Borg Hoiby, who was born from a relationship prior to Mette-Marit's 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, was arrested Monday evening.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 07:44:09 -0500",
    "summary": "A senior Israeli official has said openly that the West Bank should become part of Israel, not a future Palestine. Could it happen under Trump?",
    "story": [
      "In the wake of former President Donald Trump's re-election, Israel's far-right minister of finance suggested the country would look to annex the occupied West Bank in 2025. Here's what you need to know:",
      "What is the West Bank?",
      "The West Bank is an area of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which is part of the former British-mandated territory of Palestine. It is surrounded by Israel on three sides \u2014 the north, west, and south \u2014 and it borders the country of Jordan on its east, across the river.",
      "After the departure of British forces in 1948 when the modern state of Israel was created, Arab forces entered and retained the West Bank, and the city of Jerusalem was divided into two sectors: the Israeli west and the Jordanian east.",
      "During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and established a military administration there. Israel claimed East Jerusalem as part of its own territory, but fighting between the Israelis and the region's Palestinian inhabitants \u2014 who live with significant restrictions on their movement and other aspects of life under the decades-long occupation \u2014 has continued.",
      "Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, decisively won a 2006 West Bank parliamentary election over the Western-backed Fatah faction, led by Mahmoud Abbas, which had been administering the Palestinian Authority. The Hamas victory brought sanctions and boycotts by the U.S., the EU and Israel of the new, Hamas-led joint Palestinian leadership.",
      "In 2007, Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led administration in the West Bank and created an emergency cabinet that favored Fatah. The power struggle between the two Palestinian factions led to a split between the West Bank and Gaza, with Western powers supporting the Fatah-administered West Bank diplomatically and economically, while blockading the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.",
      "How could U.S. policy change during the second Trump administration?",
      "The longstanding position of the United States has been support for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, meaning the creation of an independent state of Palestine alongside the independent state of Israel. Most iterations of this policy envision a future Palestinian state made up of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as Gaza.",
      "Trump's previous administration bucked tradition, but did not flat-out reject a two-state solution. Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and offered a plan that would have cemented Israeli control over the entire city. It also would have protected Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, while moving toward Palestinian self-rule.",
      "President-elect Trump's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher Mike Huckabee, has never supported a two-state solution.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press when he was running to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2015, Huckabee said that, if elected, his administration would formally recognize the West Bank as part of Israel.",
      "\"I feel that we have a responsibility to respect that this is land that has historically belonged to the Jews,\" Huckabee told the AP.",
      "In a podcast interview earlier this year, Huckabee said that there \"isn't such a thing\" as Palestinians, describing himself as an \"unapologetic, unreformed Zionist.\" He voiced similar views during his campaign in 2008.",
      "Israel \"is an extraordinary oasis in a land of totalitarianism surrounded by tyranny,\" he said on the podcast earlier this year.",
      "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for Secretary of State, has repeatedly voiced support for the Israeli government's response to Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "\"Although the Biden-Harris Administration has publicly backed Israel's right to defend itself, it has also undercut Israel's maneuverability, leading to a schizophrenic policy towards the region,\" Rubio said in a letter to current Secretary of State Antony Blinken in August.",
      "Voicing his objection to U.S. sanctions against individuals alleged to be supporting \"extremist settler violence\" against Palestinians in the West Bank, Rubio wrote that, \"Israel has consistently sought peace with the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that the Palestinians, whether it be the Palestinian Authority or FTOs such as Hamas, have rejected such overtures. Israelis rightfully living in their historic homeland are not the impediment to peace; the Palestinians are.\"",
      "Israel's far-right government says it's preparing for annexation of the West Bank",
      "Some of those who do not support the creation of an independent Palestinian state do support Israel's annexation of the West Bank, including members of the current far-right Israeli government led by Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu's Likud party is currently part of a coalition, formed to keep Netanyahu in power, with radical right-wing nationalist parties such as the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "Netanyahu, who has spoken out against the creation of a Palestinian state, committed to pursuing the annexation of the West Bank in Likud's coalition agreement with the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "\"The people of Israel have a natural right to the Land of Israel,\" the agreement says. \"In light of the belief in the aforementioned right, the Prime Minister will lead the formulation and promotion of a policy within the framework of which sovereignty will be applied in the West Bank, while choosing the timing and considering all national and international interests of the state of Israel.\"",
      "Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister who's a member of the Religious Zionist Party, said he believed Israel could work with the incoming Trump administration to promote annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I am convinced that we will be able to work closely together with President-elect Trump and all members of the incoming administration, to promote the common values and interests of the two countries, to strengthen the strength and security of the State of Israel, to expand the circle of peace and stability in the Middle East out of strength and faith and on the basis of recognition in the unquestionable historical belonging of the whole Land of Israel to the people of Israel,\" Smotrich said on social media.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts in the West Bank are illegal under international law. They're also seen as a barrier to a potential two-state solution, because the more Israeli Jews live in the occupied territory, the less likely it seems that Israel would ever abandon control of the land for it to become part of a Palestinian state.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey carried out in the summer found Israelis divided on the potential security risks and benefits of continued settlement expansion, with 40% of respondents saying they help make Israel more secure and 35% saying they hurt security. The survey found 21% of Israelis didn't believe settlement expansion would have any significant impact on security.",
      "Some Israeli activists believe their government is taking advantage of the country's collective grief after the Oct. 7 attack to push an agenda in the West Bank that doesn't have broad public backing.",
      "\"In Israel, there's very little public criticism or any sort of public debate on what is going on in the West Bank,\" Sarit Michaeli, international advocacy lead for the Jerusalem-based rights group B'Tselem, told CBS News of the situation post-Oct. 7 attack. \"Israelis are furious. They're angry. They're hurt. They're traumatized, and this collective trauma has been exploited by our government to push forward policies that most Israelis don't necessarily agree with in the West Bank.\"",
      "In June, the Israeli body that governs the West Bank transferred many powers over the territory from Israeli military officials to civil ones, who work under Smotrich.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the monitoring group Peace Now says it has documented at least 43 new illegal outposts in the West Bank, mostly on farmland. Dozens of new roads have been paved to facilitate the establishment of these outposts, the group said.",
      "What would it mean if Israel does annex the West Bank?",
      "In 2020, Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) analyzed what Israeli annexation of the West Bank could actually entail. They looked at three possible scenarios, with Israel either taking full security and administrative control of a portion of the Palestinian territory, or just preventing future evacuation of existing Israeli settlements.",
      "In all three of the scenarios examined, Israeli sovereignty would not necessarily be applied in full to Palestinians in the area. If it were to be, Palestinians would live under the jurisdiction of the State of Israel and, under Israeli law, would be entitled to request citizenship.",
      "The INSS said annexing West Bank territory would make it harder for future Israeli governments to give up that land as part of any deal to create a Palestinian state.",
      "\"In actuality, annexation means tying the hands of future Israeli governments that would be willing to transfer territories for a political settlement,\" the INSS report said.",
      "One senior Palestinian politician in Gaza recently told CBS News that regardless of what changes Israel ushers in under the new leadership in Washington, it would not end the Palestinian people's decades-long fight for a state of their own.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" Mustafa Barghouti, a doctor in Gaza and the leader of the Palestinian National Initiative party, told CBS News. The Palestinian National Initiative party champions a unified democratic government for both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that,\" Barghouti said.",

      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",

      "Other sections of the guidance touched on how AI could lead to sex discrimination, with one of the examples detailing a scenario in which AI could discriminate against students who do not conform to traditional gender norms. The scenario suggested that schools using facial recognition software to check students into school could improperly flag students as a security risk because \"they do not conform to the technology\u2019s assumptions as to what girls and boys should look like, based on the sex specified in their school records.\"",
      "BEN AFFLECK IS CONFIDENT AI CANNOT REPLACE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES FOR THIS REASON",
      "The guidance notes that students who are falsely flagged can be subjected to \"embarrassment and missed class time,\" and if administrators are \"aware of the problem\" but continue to use the screening software anyway, it could result in a Title IX violation and a likely investigation by civil rights officers.",
      "This photo illustration created in Washington, D.C., shows an AI image generator in front of an image of school buses.",

      "iOS 18.1 brings a slew of AI-powered features aimed at enhancing your experience with Siri and Apple Intelligence, but it\u2019s worth questioning: How much does your iPhone really need to know about you? If you're like most people, privacy is a top priority, especially when it comes to sensitive data such as banking information, health details and your location.",
      "When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it starts \"learning\" from your interactions with certain apps, creating a digital profile that can theoretically tailor your experience. This is a double-edged sword; while personalization might sound appealing, it\u2019s crucial to consider what data Apple\u2019s AI is learning and why you might want to limit its reach.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s immigration policy is in desperate need of a high-tech overhaul.\u00a0 Most online immigration tools so far have been rudimentary, and that\u2019s often left legal immigrants complaining of long wait times, contradictory instructions, and a web presence that doesn't help with things like green card renewal or family petitions.\u00a0 Now President-Elect Trump is promising a big deportation push when he comes into office for his second term, and it\u2019s more important than ever for immigrants to have their paperwork in order.",
      "\"Immigration, legal immigration should be efficient and accessible and affordable for everyone,\" says Yasaman Soroori, the co-founder and CEO of Consulta, a new A.I.-powered platform offering high-tech solutions for those immigration issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s thought to be the first online platform dedicated specifically to helping legal immigrants navigate America\u2019s complicated immigration landscape.\u00a0 Their goal is simple;\u00a0 integrating tech with personalized support, hoping to bring order and affordability to a complex and costly process.",

      "\"We always talk about the negativity about immigration, but we don't focus on the legal immigrants that are in this country,\" says Soroori. \"And we wanted to offer them the most stress free, affordable option in order for more people to pursue it.\""

At that time, there was no confirmation from the retailer itself. However, a breach notification site has now confirmed that the personal data of 56,904,909 users was found online and leaked from customers of Hot Topic, Torrid and Box Lunch.",

While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",
      "Satanic alleges that the database contains details of 350 million users, though that number seems inflated. The leaked data does, however, include names, email addresses, physical addresses and dates of birth; all information collected through Hot Topic\u2019s loyalty program. The hacker is offering the database for $20,000 and demanding that Hot Topic pay $100,000 to prevent its sale.",
      "Hudson Rock, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, initially reported the breach and considers it credible. The firm traced the issue back to a malware infection on an employee\u2019s computer at Robling, a third-party retail analytics firm. Hudson Rock, which operates the cyber intelligence platform Cavalier to monitor compromised devices, discovered the infection and flagged it for clients.",

Hot Topic\u2019s silence could mean a few things, especially with such a big breach.

      "1) Keep a strong password:\u00a0With the Hot Topic data breach exposing sensitive information, it\u2019s essential to update your passwords. Use a strong, unique password for each account, especially for services where your personal details are stored. A mix of letters, numbers and symbols will make it harder for hackers to guess. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",
      "2) Beware of suspicious links:\u00a0After a breach, phishing attempts increase, and hackers may use your leaked email to send fake links or emails. Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Invest in a data removal service:\u00a0Since your personal information could be floating around on the dark web or public databases, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a data removal service.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored. Set up alerts for transactions and logins so you can act fast if anything seems off. Regular monitoring can help you catch fraudulent activity early, minimizing the damage if your data is misused.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Hot Topic data breach is alarming, especially since it affects over 56 million people. What makes the situation even more concerning is that Hot Topic has stayed silent about it. The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses. This situation is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene, whether you\u2019re impacted by a breach or not.",

This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",

      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",
      "WSJ reported in October that Chinese hackers had access to the networks \"for months or longer,\" enabling them to collect \"internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small and millions of Americans as their customers.\"",

      "T-Mobile has faced several hacks in recent years. In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data. Then, in January 2023, a misconfigured application programming interface exposed personal data for 37 million current customers, marking yet another significant security lapse.",

Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced. We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities.\"",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

      "Mimran also added that the provision of international law that protects against entry into a hospital \"can be eroded if the hospital is being misused in order to bring about a military advantage to Hamas,\" whether it is being used to store weapons, act as a headquarters, or holds hostages. In those cases, \"Israel has a right to enter the hospital, to operate from within the hospital,\" but must \"minimize any harm to the functionality of the hospital.\" If a hospital is being used as a permanent structure to \"promote attacks against an army,\" Israel could \"treat the hospital as a military object.\"",

That is why Trump went so far as to say during the campaign that if Mexico did not cooperate on these issues, he would make public the U.S. government's intelligence information on politicians in Mexico who are related to drug cartels. The relationship is going to be approached in a more comprehensive way. I don't see that the Mexican government is preparing for that.\"",

      "The panel voted no unanimously.",
      "Before the parole board ruled, a weeping Smith acknowledged that what she did to 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex \"was horrible.\"",
      "\"I would give anything if I could go back and change it,\" she said, taking off her glasses and wiping her eyes. \"I'm sorry. I know that's not enough. I know they're just word but they come from my heart.\"",

      "The 46-year-old country star had gone to his Maydelle, Texas, ranch\u00a0on Thursday by himself. The next day, following a solo hunting trip, he was loading his Jeep when his .22 revolver suddenly went off.",
      "\u201cI wanted to come on and tell you guys that I'm still alive thankfully, thanks to the good Lord above, and the wonderful first responders that helped me as well as the trauma team at UT Tyler,\u201d Head said in a series of videos posted to Facebook this week.",

      "Despite the thoughts of death, he said he felt peace.",
      "\u201cI remember I was laying there looking at the ceiling of the helicopter. I was surrounded by my children. They were holding hands over me, and they were laughing. Of course, none of it was real. That was just what was going on in my mind,\u201d he said.",

      "The two former Georgia election workers who won an almost $150 million defamation judgment against former Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani want him held in civil contempt for continuing to falsely accuse them of committing election fraud in the 2020 election.",
      "In papers filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., attorneys for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss say Giuliani has continued to make false claims about them online despite a court-approved deal in May where he \"agreed to be bound by a permanent injunction prohibiting him from repeating the same or similar statements to the statements adjudged to be false and defamatory.\"",
      "\"It took only six months for Mr. Giuliani to resume his defamatory campaign\" against the mother and daughter, the filing said, including making false claims about them on his livestreamed \"America's Mayor Live\" show earlier this month. Among the comments he made were that they \"quadruple\" counted votes and used \"hard drives\" to \"fix the machines,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing said those claims are \"unambiguous violations of the Consent Injunction, and the Court should hold him in civil contempt.\" The pair are seeking an unspecified amount in fines for the violations, and for Giuliani to be put on notice that he'll be fined for any future violations. \"Fixing the appropriate sanction \u2014 particularly fixing an amount sufficiently 'calibrated' to coerce Giuliani\u2019s compliance with the Consent Injunction, in light of his demonstrated willingness to repeatedly violate court orders \u2014 may require factfinding by this Court after an evidentiary hearing,\" the filing said.",
      "A representative for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, called the motion \"a dishonest and duplicitous attack meant to deprive Mayor Rudy Giuliani of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\"",
      "\"The ongoing lawfare against Mayor Giuliani must end,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Giuliani was found liable for defaming the pair during his efforts on Trump's behalf to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Freeman and Moss said the false accusations forced them out of their jobs and led to a torrent of racist death threats.",
      "A jury awarded them $148 million after a damages trial last year. A judge later reduced the award, which Giuliani is appealing, to $146 million.",
      "Giuliani filed for bankruptcy afterwards, but that case was dismissed after he repeatedly failed to turn over required financial information.",
      "Freeman and Moss filed suit in New York looking to enforce their judgment earlier this year, and their attorneys accused Giuliani of slow-walking the surrender of his assets and again failing to turn over necessary filing information. Giuliani began surrendering at least some of his assets in the past week, including luxury watches and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz that once belonged to Hollywood legend Lauren Bacall, according to court filings.",
      "The turnover came after one of the workers' attorneys, Aaron Nathan, told U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman that Giuliani had surreptitiously cleaned out items from his New York apartment that were supposed to be handed over to his client and sent them to a storage facility. The attorneys said they are now reviewing the contents of the storage facility, but there are still assets Giuliani has not turned over.",
      "\"Plaintiff has not turned over any cash, and does not appear to have any intention of turning over any cash beyond a few thousand dollars in one account,\" they said in a court filing this week.",
      "Giuliani is challenging their claim to a limited number of items, including his Florida condo and Yankees World Series rings that he says he gifted to his son. Those challenges will be the subject of what's expected to be a brief trial starting on Jan. 16, but Giuliani is seeking to have that date pushed back because of unspecified \"inauguration events\" ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "Moss and Freeman's attorneys urged the judge to stick with the current trial date, which was set last month. \"Mr. Giuliani\u2019s preference for attending an event three days prior to the inauguration itself does not remotely constitute good cause to adjourn this trial,\" they wrote."

      "The murder plot trial, which started Monday, took place in Knoxville, Tennessee. NBC News affiliate WBIR in Knoxville reported that the jury convicted Kelley on all three counts after just an hour of deliberation. Kelley will be sentenced in the murder plot case on May 7, one month after he is set to be sentenced on his Capitol case, on April 7.",
      "Kelley's trial in Knoxville featured testimony from co-defendant Austin Carter, who pleaded guilty in November 2023. Carter told authorities that he and Kelley plotted \u201cto murder employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\" in December 2022, months after Kelley\u2019s arrest on Jan. 6 charges. Kelley provided a list of about 37 members of law enforcement who worked on his Jan. 6 case, prosecutors alleged.",
      "Carter, according to WBIR, told jurors that Kelley thought the country was heading toward civil war and wanted to strike first, initially planning to attack the FBI Knoxville field office before deciding to target individual FBI employees who had worked on his Jan. 6 case.",
      "Christopher Roddy, who had worked with Kelley in security and tipped off the FBI, also testified during the trial, as did three FBI special agents who said they saw the list as a threat.",
      "Kelley, an anti-abortion activist, wore a sweatshirt reading TCAPP, standing for \u201cThe Church At Planned Parenthood,\u201d when he became the fourth rioter to breach the U.S. Capitol. During his trial in Washington on the Jan. 6 charges, the government made the case that Kelley had been armed with a weapon when he stormed the Capitol. While prosecutors illustrated that Kelley was wearing a gun holster that could be concealed on the inside of his pants and showed what they believed to be the \"printing\" of a gun, they didn't conclusively prove that allegation, and it was not central to their case.",
      "During the Jan. 6 attack, prosecutors said, Kelley's wife messaged him to ask how things were going, writing that she didn't believe the \"fake news.\" Kelley encouraged his wife to download Signal, the encrypted communications app, prosecutors said."

      "It\u2019s something that\u2019s already irking Trump, who signaled that Republicans should block any attempts by Democrats to further their judicial agenda.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door. Republican Senators need to Show Up and Hold the Line \u2014 No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday.",
      "But Republicans \u2014 who famously pushed through a Trump Supreme Court appointment just one week before the 2020 election \u2014 do not have the power to stop it.",
      "GOP senators can slow the process down, but Democrats need a simple majority to overcome any obstruction and confirm judges. A senior Biden administration official working on judicial nominations noted that in the 2020 lame-duck session, after Trump had lost the election, Senate Republicans continued to confirm his judges.",
      "Confirming more judges is the top priority for Schumer and Senate Democrats\u00a0before they relinquish power to the new Congress, which will be controlled by Republicans in both chambers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll confirm as many judges as possible in the lame duck,\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said.",
      "The clash came to a head Monday after Democrats confirmed a judge to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Schumer kept the Senate in session until nearly midnight, holding another 18 roll-call votes over a six-hour span to tee up another seven confirmation votes on Biden-picked judges later this week.",
      "If they\u2019re all confirmed, that would bring Biden\u2019s total to 223 federal judges.",
      "That\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s final tally of 234 judges confirmed in his first term, a number that Democrats have set out to beat since they defeated him in the 2020 election. This summer, however, Schumer stopped short of guaranteeing it.",
      "The Biden administration official said the Trump number is beatable, arguing that there are enough pending nominees on the calendar or awaiting consideration in committee.",
      "\u201cWe could exceed the 234,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is not about beating Trump\u2019s numbers. This is about getting good people on the bench. Is 235 within the realm of possibility? It is. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving it.\u201d",
      "At this time, the White House has not announced plans to nominate judges to other unfilled vacancies. That includes various openings in red states that are subject to the \u201cblue slip\u201d courtesy, where home-state Republican senators must sign off before they get consideration.",
      "The senior administration official declined to discuss whether Biden has talked to Harris or Schumer about lame-duck confirmations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into conversations the president has had,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut you can certainly assume this remains a topic of discussion and engagement.\u201d",
      "A Senate Democratic aide was heartened by the notion that Harris would be on call to break ties.",
      "\u201cHope she\u2019s not needed,\u201d the aide said. \u201cBut glad that\u2019s an option while Dems have the majority.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:40:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Big retailers\u2019 fortunes are diverging ahead of the holiday shopping season, with consumers proving to be choosy spenders in the run-up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Big retailers\u2019 fortunes are diverging as the holiday shopping season gets underway. Target missed the mark, while Walmart nailed it \u2014 a difference that partly comes down to bargain-hungry customers\u2019 finicky appetites for nonessentials, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe main takeaway here is that the American consumer is still being very value-conscious and increasingly shifting their dollars to Walmart from many other retailers, including Target,\u201d said Brad Thomas, managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
      "On Wednesday, Target cited \u201clingering softness in discretionary categories\u201d as a top factor in its disappointing third-quarter sales, as many budget-conscious shoppers continue to focus on necessities. It\u2019s the latest sign that discounts will be the driving force this holiday season, as they\u2019ve been for much of this year.",
      "The American consumer is still being very value-conscious.",
      "Brad Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets",
      "Customers still seem eager to reward other brands that double down on value. Walmart posted better-than-expected earnings this week and gave a solid outlook heading into the holidays. In fact, spending outside its grocery aisles ticked up for the second quarter in a row, reversing a long run of declines. The parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls also said its holiday season was off to a \u201cstrong start,\u201d noting it offers shoppers a \u201cdestination for gifts at excellent values.\u201d",
      "Yet even Walmart executives flagged consumers\u2019 lingering caution, with CFO John David Rainey telling CNBC that many shoppers are holding off on big-ticket purchases until they spot a compelling deal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re expecting this holiday period to be very consistent with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on price and value.\u201d",
      "Analysts say that\u2019s part of a steady return to normal for consumer spending after the Covid-era upheavals that sent prices to heights from which they\u2019re still coming down.",
      "\u201cPeople went out and bought a bunch of stuff [during] the pandemic, and then stopped buying stuff for a couple of years,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get back to normal here.\u201d",
      "U.S. retail sales rose 0.4% overall in October, federal data showed last month, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts. And the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, expects \u201csteady sales growth\u201d ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% above last season\u2019s levels. \u201cThe economy remains fundamentally healthy,\u201d NRF president Matthew Shay said in a statement last month, adding that households\u2019 \u201ccapacity to spend will continue to be supported by a strong job market and wage growth.\u201d",
      "A consumer report released Wednesday by credit-reporting agency TransUnion found U.S. households\u2019 concerns about inflation were easing, with 63% saying their finances were better than or about as they\u2019d planned, up from 60% in the previous quarter.",
      "Still, many said they continued to worry about affording basics. \u201cHeading to the grocery store was a bit daunting for consumers trying to make ends meet this quarter,\u201d the TransUnion researchers wrote.",
      "There are signs that Target\u2019s struggles may not reflect the retail industry overall. The company got in on the price-slashing action this year \u2014 announcing discounts on some 2,000 items just weeks ago \u2014\u00a0as part of a broader push into value, but it still stumbled.",
      "\u201cA lot of it comes down to the company just not positioning itself well enough in what is a slightly more challenging market,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. That includes pulling back on staffing, he said, and limiting the hours for customers to use self-checkout lanes.",
      "Some shoppers have complained about Target and other retailers locking up more essentials like toothpaste and deodorant to prevent theft, adding to what Saunders called a \u201cmessy\u201d situation that has led some customers to defect to rivals that have also slashed prices.",
      "Indeed, discounts are widespread and the ongoing price competition shows signs of slowing. If anything, the discount wars are getting a bit hotter as major retailers\u2019 price cuts steadily narrow the gap with Amazon\u2019s, which continue to set the pace for holiday-season bargains, NBC News\u2019 Holiday Price Check shows.",
      "But while some big-box stores are still seeing shoppers eager to buy nonessentials, others are flagging the reverse \u2014 indicating that not all discretionary spending is equal this season. When it comes to home renovations, for instance, Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot saw higher sales from repairs related to hurricanes Helene and Milton, but both expected full-year declines as customers defer big projects.",
      "In the meantime, the steady expansion of e-commerce looks set to continue this holiday season. One of Target\u2019s few bright spots for the quarter was in digital sales, which increased nearly 11% year on year. Walmart\u2019s online sales were even stronger, soaring 27% on the year. That trend is also turning up in hiring data, with ZipRecruiter saying in a report this week that it is seeing a clear shift toward e-commerce hiring, while traditional growth in retail roles has been sluggish.",
      "Analysts expect retailers to continue focusing on ways to chase online shoppers over the holidays, especially younger ones who\u2019ve been some of the fastest adopters of Buy Now, Pay Later installment loans \u2014 for luxury purchases and daily basics alike.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very savvy at using those sorts of financial tools,\u201d Saunders said, adding that he expects to continue to see retailers \u201coffering those services that this cohort wants.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Comcast announced a plan Wednesday to spin off most of its cable television networks into a separate publicly traded company.",
      "The new company will include the USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and the Golf Channel. Comcast will retain key NBCUniversal assets, including the NBC broadcast network, NBC News, NBC Sports, the streaming service Peacock and the cable channel Bravo.",
      "\u201cThe transaction will be structured as a tax-free spin to existing shareholders,\u201d Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said in an internal memo. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a precise timetable for completing the transition, we are estimating that it will take approximately a year.\u201d",
      "Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.",
      "The move comes as the traditional cable television bundle faces stiff economic headwinds, most notably the rise of cord-cutting and the shift to streaming alternatives. Comcast\u2019s cable portfolio still contributes to its financial bottom line and helps expand its cultural footprint.",
      "\u201cThe well-capitalized, independent company will be positioned to lead in the changing landscape for cable networks given the strength of its portfolio and the quality and focus of its management team,\u201d Cavanagh said.",
      "The new company, known for the time being as SpinCo, \u201cwill have significant cash flow, a strong balance sheet, and the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, both organically and potentially through acquisitions,\u201d Cavanagh added.",
      "Cavanagh said the new company will be led by Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBCUniversal\u2019s media group. Anand Kini, NBCUniversal\u2019s chief financial officer, will serve as the CFO and chief operating officer.",
      "The plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and then confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday by two people familiar with the matter.",
      "The new business structure is notable partly because it would separate MSNBC and CNBC from the central newsgathering operations of NBC News. It was not immediately clear whether the cable news channels and the network\u2019s core news division would continue to share editorial resources.",
      "Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst covering the technology sector at Wedbush Securities, said in an email that the spinoff move is appealing to investors. Comcast\u2019s stock price rose by about 0.5% in premarket trading Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe Street wanted to see this move and we believe it will be a smart strategic move for both Comcast and the new spinoff with golden jewel cable assets like CNBC and MSNBC,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cord cutting dynamic is a headwind but we see brighter days ahead as cable defines a new monetization and streaming path with subscriptions and content to build on its strong advertising base looking forward.\u201d",
      "Rich Greenfield, a media and technology analyst who often criticizes media companies for what he views as a belated reaction to cord-cutting, framed the move in blunt terms in an appearance on CNBC: \u201cThis is sort of a very clear, direct statement by Comcast.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are exiting the cable network business,\u201d said Greenfield, a co-founder of research firm LightShed Partners. \u201cThis is them saying we don\u2019t want to be in this business. This is no longer a growth business. It\u2019s going to be around for a long time, but it\u2019s just no longer a growth business.\u201d",
      "Cavanagh on Wednesday also announced a reorganized leadership team for NBCUniversal.",
      "Cesar Conde will continue leading the NBCUniversal News Group as chairman. The division includes NBC News, the NBC News Now streaming product, Telemundo and the company\u2019s owned-and-operated local stations. Cavanagh added Conde \u201cwill work closely with me on other growth opportunities for NBCUniversal.\u201d",
      "Donna Langley will become chair of NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, a role that will give her broad oversight over all entertainment programming and marketing across NBC, Peacock and Bravo, as well as the company\u2019s film and television studios.",
      "Matt Strauss will become chairman of the NBCUniversal Media Group. Mark Woodbury will continue in his role as chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Destinations & Experiences, the unit that runs the theme parks and global consumer products business.",
      "Comcast agreed to buy a majority stake in NBCUniversal from General Electric in 2009, combining one of the country\u2019s largest operators of cable TV with the sizable NBC media and entertainment operation. The cable channels were seen as a particularly lucrative acquisition.",
      "Since then, the rise of streaming entertainment has eaten into the cable television business, leading to waves of consumers canceling their cable subscriptions in favor of platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.",
      "In this environment, many cable channels are still profitable businesses, with some continuing to generate strong cash flows for their corporate owners. But the media industry writ large considers the cable marketplace to be in decline.",
      "Comcast, like other leading media conglomerates, has invested heavily in streaming. Peacock, home to a large library of NBCUniversal content and programming licensed from other studios, added 3 million subscribers during the third fiscal quarter, according to the company\u2019s most recent earnings report. Comcast lost 365,000 cable customers during that period."

      "The\u00a0Disney\u00a0fleet is expanding.",
      "Next month, the Disney Treasure cruise ship will make its maiden voyage from Port Canaveral, Florida, to the Caribbean, officially becoming the sixth ship in the company\u2019s lineup.",
      "The Treasure, which is 221 feet tall and 1,119 feet long, can carry 4,000 passengers and 1,555 crew members. Like Disney\u2019s other cruise ships, the Treasure features themed dining, curated lounges and premium on-board live entertainment.",
      "As the Treasure sets sail, Disney, too, is embarking on its own journey. The company, which hadn\u2019t launched a new ship in a decade prior to the\u00a0Disney Wish\u2019s debut in mid-2022,\u00a0is entering an era of rapid expansion.",
      "Disney\u2019s fleet will double by 2031, with two ships arriving in 2025 \u2014 the Disney Destiny and the Disney Adventure \u2014 followed by four additional Disney-branded vessels and a partnership with Oriental Land Company to bring Disney\u2019s cruise vacations to Japan.",
      "\u201cDisney Cruise Line is going through an unprecedented period of growth,\u201d said Thomas Mazloum, president of Disney\u2019s new experiences portfolio and Disney signature experiences. \u201cThe demand that we\u2019re seeing right now for Disney Cruise Line is very strong. We\u2019re a premium brand, occupancy is high, and frankly, the business is doing really, really well.\u201d",
      "Disney cruises are part of the company\u2019s experiences division, alongside parks, resorts and consumer products. According to the company\u2019s earnings report on Thursday, the division posted record revenue and profit for\u00a0fiscal 2024, with revenue up 5% for the full year to $34.15 billion and operating income up 4% to $9.27 billion.",
      "The experiences segment was the second-highest revenue driver for Disney last year behind its entertainment division, which tallied $41.18 billion in fiscal 2024. However, the entertainment segment\u2019s operating profits were smaller, just $3.92 billion.",
      "Full-year revenue growth in experiences was the strongest of any Disney division, and the company expects to see 6% to 8% profit growth for experiences in fiscal 2025.",
      "Disney has become a leader in the family cruising space, despite its relatively small number of ships. For comparison, the three largest cruise lines are\u00a0Carnival, with more than 100 vessels,\u00a0Royal Caribbean, with more than 40, and\u00a0Norwegian Cruise Line, with around 30.",
      "Disney is considered slightly more expensive than Carnival and Royal Caribbean for base pricing, but if guests choose to upgrade to larger cabins or add food packages or experiences to their itineraries, the prices are quite similar.",
      "Disney\u2019s Treasure offers seven-night cruises starting at\u00a0$4,277 for two guests\u00a0and $6,994 for a family of four. These prices increase if travelers select cruises tied to Halloween or Christmas.",
      "What sets Disney apart is its innovations in cruising and its focus on storytelling, said Gavin Doyle,\u00a0founder of MickeyVisit.com.",
      "\u201cDisney redefined the cruising space when they entered, and that was in the way they were designing the ships in a guest-centric way that they serviced people on board, and also the beloved characters and intellectual properties that they can integrate,\u201d he said.",
      "Doyle noted that Disney accommodates diners using \u201crotational dining\u201d on its cruise ships. Passengers don\u2019t eat in one large mess hall \u2014 they are prescheduled to dine at different themed restaurants. Disney rotates the restaurant staff, too, to follow each group of passengers to their scheduled restaurant. In so doing, guests have the same servers, busboys and restaurant managers throughout their trip, and the waitstaff gets to know the guests \u2014 and their preferences.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re able to just deliver this level of customer service that does feel like magic,\u201d Doyle said.",
      "Immersive dining",
      "While there are traditional amenities onboard the Treasure that are staples on cruise lines \u2014 upscale restaurants, pools, spas and gaming rooms for kids \u2014 Disney has integrated storytelling into these services to elevate them for guests.",
      "Its dinnertime restaurants are immersive and feature live entertainment. Plaza de Coco, the first theatrical dining experience themed to the 2017 film \u201cCoco,\u201d invites guests to gather at Mariachi Plaza for a festive meal and music.",
      "Meanwhile, over at Worlds of Marvel, guests will experience two different shows, one called \u201cAvengers: Quantum Encounter\u201d and the other \u201cMarvel Celebration of Heroes: Groot Remix.\u201d",

      "In addition to the three main family restaurants, the Treasure has a number of places for casual dining and to grab quick bites during the journey. Those with a sweet tooth can head to Jumbeaux\u2019s Sweets, which is based on the ice cream parlor from Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s the first time a ballot measure proposed raising the statewide minimum wage has failed since 1996.",
      "The California measure, listed as Proposition 32 on the ballot,  proposed bumping the state's minimum wage to $18 per hour by 2026, which would have made it the highest in the U.S.",
      "With 92% of the vote counted, the \u201cno\u201d vote against the measure had the support of 50.8% of voters, while the \u201cyes\u201d vote had 49.2%.",
      "Supporters of the measure said it would have benefitted workers, while opponents argued that its passage would have increased costs for employers, which would have likely prompted them to fire employees.",
      "The California Chamber of Commerce, which opposed the measure, lauded its defeat in a statement.",
      "\u201cCalChamber opposed Prop. 32 because it would have resulted in higher costs for small business employers and consumers,\u201d the group's CEO, Jennifer Barrera, said in a statement. \u201cWith the economy and costs top of mind for many voters this election, that message appears to have resonated.\u201d",
      "California\u2019s current state minimum wage for most workers is $16 per hour, though under a law signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that went into effect in March, the minimum wage for many fast food workers is $20 per hour.",
      "Another law signed by Newsom increased the minimum wage in the state for many health care workers to $25 per hour starting last month.",
      "California\u2019s current $16 minimum wage is already among the highest in the nation. Some cities within New York also implement a minimum wage of $16 per hour, while Washington state\u2019s minimum wage is $16.26 per hour. Hawaii\u2019s minimum wage is set to gradually increase to $18 per hour in 2028 under a law passed in 2022.",
      "The defeat is the first time in 28 years that a ballot measure to increase a state minimum wage was defeated. According to Ballotpedia, which tracks the outcomes of statewide ballot measures, voters had passed all 26 measures to increase state minimum wages that appeared on statewide ballots since 1996, when voters in Missouri and Montana rejected increases.",
      "Meanwhile, ballot measures in two other states to increase the minimum wage overwhelmingly passed this month.",
      "Voters in Alaska and Missouri approved measures to gradually raise their state minimum wages to $15 per hour by 2026, according to NBC News projections, with increases after that year attached to economic data.\u00a0Both measures won by 16-point margins."

      "However, it is clear that Nancy chose to only believe certain parts of Jonathan\u2019s life. As a mother, she was enamored by her son and appeared to be taken aback once she learned why Jonathan\u2019s girlfriend, Sasha, left him alone on vacation in Italy and returned home to London just days before he died.",
      "In \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Nancy receives a phone call from Sasha\u2019s mother, Emma, after her daughter has already returned home aggravated. In the call, she\u2019s told that Sasha and Jonathan had some kind of falling out.",
      "When Emma gives Nancy more details, Nancy appears to lose her patience and says, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s up to them to sort out their differences. Let\u2019s not aggrandize things here, Emma. We don\u2019t know what went on down there.\u201d",
      "\"Nancy\u2019s impulse to write \u2018The Perfect Stranger\u2019 was a way for her to protect her son and change the narrative of her son.\"",
      "Alfonso Cuaron",
      "Nancy even goes as far as to say that Sasha has been \u201cexaggerating\u201d about her and Jonathan\u2019s split and what she told her mother is \u201cnonsense\u201d that sounds \u201cvery extreme.\u201d",
      "Although the show does not share what Emma said on the phone, it\u2019s clear that Nancy knew her son might be dangerous to some degree and she chose to ignore the signs.",
      "When Stephen asks Nancy about the phone call, Nancy simply tells him that Emma said their kids had an argument and that\u2019s why they are no longer together. Without questioning it, Stephen believes Nancy and then calls Sasha \u201ca mess,\u201d which Cuar\u00f3n says further demonstrates the show\u2019s message that you should \u201cbeware of narrative and form.\u201d",
      "Cuar\u00f3n explains that Stephen is a \u201cvery weak person\u201d who has been \u201cundermined\u201d by Nancy and Jonathan and that\u2019s why he was \u201cin denial\u201d for so long.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just afraid to confront anything, and he just takes Nancy\u2019s point of view as his own. So, he was in denial,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n explains. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we don\u2019t want to think those things of our children, but when it comes to Stephen, he is completely submissive to his wife\u2019s version of reality.\u201d",
      "As for whether or not Nancy knew about Jonathan\u2019s violent nature? Cuar\u00f3n says, \u201cI would almost be certain of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn many ways, Nancy\u2019s impulse to write \u2018The Perfect Stranger\u2019 was a way for her to protect her son and change the narrative of her son,\u201d he explained. \u201cThanks to the book, she could turn her son into this naive, heroic, romantic figure, which is very different from the reality.\u201d",
      "Does Nicholas die?",
      "At the beginning of \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Stephen makes it clear that he published his wife\u2019s book, \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d simply to torture Catherine. He wants her closest friends and family members to know the part that she played in Jonathan\u2019s death.",
      "Stephen creates a complicated catfishing scheme to tell Nicholas his role in the story. Distraught by his mother\u2019s representation in the novel, Nicholas overdoses and ends up unconscious in the hospital.",
      "Once in the hospital, Stephen tries to kill Nicholas by injecting him with an unknown substance. However, Catherine stops him just in time.",
      "He then tries again once he spikes Catherine\u2019s tea, which puts her into a deep slumber. At the hospital, Stephen tries to give Nicholas the deadly injection, but he stops once he sympathizes with a confused Nicholas, who is calling out for his mom.",
      "What does Stephen see in the photograph?",
      "After the truth comes out about Jonathan, Stephen then decides to burn all the explicit photos that his son took of Catherine on the night he raped her.",
      "As he places the photos into the fire, Stephen sees a small but important detail he missed \u2014 Nicholas was there in the room when Catherine got assaulted.",
      "A photograph shows a young Nicholas looking on at his mother from the reflection in the mirror. It\u2019s at that moment that Stephen realizes his journey for retribution hurt more people than he realized.",
      "\u201cRevenge and retribution are just going to end up in the same way because it\u2019s just like the saying \u2014 \u2018He who seeks revenge should dig two graves,\u2019\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "At the end of the show, Catherine opens up to Nicholas about what happened to her in Italy. Nicholas starts crying and says he doesn\u2019t remember the trip or that she was raped. While feeling remorseful, he hugs his mother and they both take the opportunity to get to know one another better on a clean slate.",
      "\u201cVery often, we don\u2019t remember traumatic episodes that we witness. But the fact that we don\u2019t remember them doesn\u2019t mean that they are not stored inside us and come out in different behaviors. This is shown with Nicholas and his addictive behaviors,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "\u201cDisclaimer\u201d ends with Catherine rebuilding her bond with her son. After putting her career first for many years, she decides to focus on Nicholas and mending their once strained relationship."

    "summary": "Who is Charles Manson and what comes out in the Peacock documentary Making Manson? Does he confess to new murders? What to know.",
    "story": [
      "Fifty years after the\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family killings, the name Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0still evokes a strong image \u2014 that of a shaggy-haired cult leader who spoke provocatively about mass murder.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty. I haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of. Maybe I haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d\u00a0Manson said in a\u00a01987 interview with TODAY\u00a0at California\u2019s San Quentin prison. \u201cMaybe I should have killed four, five hundred people, then I would have felt better. Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.\u201d",
      "Manson, whose followers committed a series of brutal killings in the late 1960s, is known for his infamous crimes. What\u2019s less known is who\u00a0Manson\u00a0was behind the scenes, when he was not being interviewed or making erratic outbursts in the courtroom.",
      "A new Peacock docuseries, \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson,\u201d out Nov. 19, features 20 years of never-before-heard recordings of\u00a0Manson\u2019s private phone conversations from prison. Peacock is owned by TODAY\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "More than 100 hours of audio recordings were provided by John Michael Jones, a man who says he first wrote to\u00a0Manson\u00a0in an effort to get his signature, then struck up a decadeslong relationship with him,\u00a0according to his interview in the documentary.\u00a0They stayed in touch until\u00a0Manson\u2019s death in 2017.",
      "These recordings \u201cgave us a candid conversation that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019ve never seen\u00a0Manson\u00a0without the mask before,\u201d the documentary\u2019s director, Billie Mintz, tells\u00a0TODAY.com.",
      "Mintz says the documentary, which also features several interviews with former members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s circle, is not meant to exonerate\u00a0Manson, but to add dimension and context to the widely accepted narrative about him. The documentary also includes the perspective of a forensic psychologist who analyzes\u00a0Manson\u2019s tapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I have sympathy for\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says, \u201cbut by humanizing him, we understand a lot more of what led to these tragic events, and we learned a lot more about ourselves.\u201d",
      "Read on to learn more about Charles\u00a0Manson, and what is revealed in \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson.\u201d",
      "Who was Charles Manson?",
      "Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0was a cult leader who was convicted in murder in 1971\u00a0after his\u00a0supporters committed a series of violent murders under his influence.",
      "Manson\u2019s followers, many of whom were teenage girls drawn to communal living and other 1960s counterculture ideals, have opened up about how he exerted power over them.",
      "\u201cHe was always needing to be in control, and that came from having all control taken from him at a very young age, and being helpless,\u201d former follower Catherine Share says in the documentary.",
      "Share was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but served five years for involvement in a\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family robbery and later served a sentence for participating in a credit card scheme,\u00a0per AP.",
      "\u201cAnd a man does not want to be helpless, and he\u2019ll do anything not to feel that way again. He tried love for a while. He said, \u2018Oh, that worked.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But fear is stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0had a troubled upbringing full of trauma and abandonment, per\u00a0NBC News, and he had frequent run-ins with the law from a young age. By the time he was 32 and released from a 10-year prison term in 1967, he had spent half his life in prison, Vincent Bugliosi \u2014 a true crime author and the prosecutor at\u00a0Manson\u2019s trial for the Tate-LaBianca Murder \u2014 estimates in \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d a definitive book about\u00a0Manson. After his release, he moved to San Francisco and began attracting members of a group he called the Family. Members of the Family would go on to commit murders at\u00a0Manson\u2019s ordering.",
      "In April 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit murder, for the deaths of seven people in what is often referred to as the Tate-LaBianca murders.",
      "Members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers killed five people during the Tate murders, which took place on Aug. 9, 1969.",
      "Actor Sharon Tate Polanski, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was one of the people killed during a gathering at her home. She had been 8 months pregnant. Also murdered were hair stylist Jay Sebring, Folger coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her boyfriend, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent, who was visiting the caretaker of the Polanskis\u2019 guest house.",
      "The next day on Aug. 10,\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers murdered two more people, Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary LaBianca, at their home in Los Angeles, per the Associated Press.",
      "While\u00a0Manson\u00a0was not physically present for any of these murders, prosecutors argued he held responsibility for the killings because he had known about the planned violence and had been closely involved in directing his followers to commit murder.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s thesis was that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was vicariously liable for the acts of all the co-indictees,\u201d according to a\u00a01976 opinion\u00a0issued in the Court of Appeals of California. \u201cIf the jury believed\u00a0Manson\u00a0to be a conspirator, aider or abettor he was culpable for all of the homicides regardless of who held the knife.\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0spoke to his role in the murders in the documentary. \u201cI never said I was innocent. I said I didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d he said.",
      "In March 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and three of his followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for their roles in the Tate-LaBianca killings,\u00a0NBC News reported in his obit. Van Houten was charged in conspiracy for all the killings but for murder only in the LaBianca killings. Tex Watson was also sentenced to death later that year, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0in 1971.",
      "In December 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0received two further first-degree murder convictions for the July 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman, per\u00a0NBC News, and the August 1969 death of stuntman and actor Donald Shea, per\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Bobby Beausoleil was convicted in the killing of Hinman in 1970 and remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "In 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0devotee Bruce Davis was convicted in the killing of Hinman and Shea, and he remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Steve Grogan was also convicted in Shea\u2019s killing and was released on parole in 1985 after revealing the location of Shea\u2019s body, per\u00a0the L.A. Times.",
      "The following year,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers\u2019 sentences were commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.",
      "Manson\u00a0remained incarcerated for the rest of his life. He died at 83 from natural causes on Nov. 19, 2017, at a hospital in Kern County, California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Atkins, convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, died in prison of cancer in 2009,\u00a0NBC News reported. Watson and Krenwinkel, both convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, remain in prison, per the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Van Houten, convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, was freed on parole in 2023,\u00a0NBC News reported.",
      "What is revealed in the Peacock documentary about\u00a0Manson?",
      "The \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson\u201d docuseries features never-before-heard audio recordings of\u00a0Manson\u00a0discussing his childhood, his followers and his criminal convictions.",
      "In one recording,\u00a0Manson\u00a0claims that he murdered multiple people in Mexico.",
      "\u201cSee, there\u2019s a whole part of my life that nobody knows about,\u201d he tells Jones in the tape. \u201cI lived in Mexico for a while. I went to Acapulco, stole some cars. I just got involved in stuff over my head, man \u2026 got involved in a couple of killings. I left my .357 Magnum in Mexico City, and I left some dead people on the beach.\u201d",
      "He also argues that he was not responsible for the murders his followers committed and accuses the media of twisting his story.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the media. The media that starts selling that. They didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. They wanted that hippie cult leader thing, man,\u201d he says in one recording. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a f--- whether I did it or whether I didn\u2019t do it. They wanted that vicarious thrill.\u201d",
      "Jones says in the documentary that he resonated with\u00a0Manson\u2019s difficult childhood experiences and describes building up a trusting relationship with\u00a0Manson\u00a0over the years.",
      "\u201cHe found somebody he could be vulnerable to. I think that\u2019s why Charlie gave me a lot of what we have on these tapes. And I think the longer I spent getting to know him, slowly that mask began to peel off,\u201d he says.",
      "Director Billie Mintz says it\u2019s possible that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was lying at times on the tapes and attempting to manipulate Jones.",
      "\u201cI think that for sure,\u00a0Manson\u00a0wanted (Jones) to like him, and (Jones) wanted to like\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s manipulation, but from listening to these stories, (Manson) didn\u2019t have any reason to. He didn\u2019t want to get out of prison. He wasn\u2019t trying to exonerate himself. He literally says, \u2018I\u2019m a bad guy. I should be in prison, but I shouldn\u2019t be in prison for this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mintz says the documentary places the tapes in context by interviewing a wide range of\u00a0Manson\u00a0experts and former followers to create \u201cdiscourse where there was no discourse before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t say we know the truth, but maybe we give you a more nuanced, closer version of the story to the truth than you might\u2019ve had before,\u201d he says.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe documentary features interviews with multiple former members of the Family, including Dianne Lake, who was 14 when she met\u00a0Manson.\u00a0She wrote in her memoir \u201cMember of the Family\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0she did not participate in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and in fact testified against\u00a0Manson\u00a0and other members of the Family during the murder trial.",
      "Lake, who was known by the nickname \u201cSnake\u201d in the Family, describes how\u00a0Manson\u00a0allegedly treated his female followers.",
      "\u201cHe definitely used us and he definitely abused us,\u201d she says. \u201cI got hit and beat and raped, once, and I think the other girls probably did, too, but they kept it a secret.\u201d",
      "Share, another former\u00a0Manson\u00a0associate, recalls\u00a0Manson\u00a0turning \u201cabsolutely dark and electrified and menacing.\u201d",
      "The documentary also features interviews with\u00a0Manson\u2019s former cellmate and family members of the Family\u2019s victims, as well as interviews with an investigative reporter, a forensic psychologist and a former FBI special agent and criminologist.",
      "Near the end of the documentary, Jones defends his relationship with\u00a0Manson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a fanboy. I\u2019m a f------ human being with a heart who happened to befriend somebody that I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d he says.",

      "If the Kremlin was hoping to instill fear among its Western foes by lowering the bar for its use of nuclear weapons, then it may have been disappointed Wednesday.",

      "The updated document includes a change that allows for Moscow to launch a nuclear strike if attacked by a nonnuclear country, such as Ukraine, that is supported by a nuclear state, such as the U.S.\u00a0It was formally approved the same day that Kyiv used its first U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles against Russia.",
      "But while the chances of Putin deploying a devastating nuclear weapon in his war with Ukraine are never nil, world leaders and analysts alike expressed doubts that the change amounted to much more than a new and more intense effort to deter the West.",

      "\u201cRussia\u2019s move will tie in with the campaign by its backers in the West to paint the easing of restrictions on ATACMS strikes into Russia as a dangerous escalation,\u201d said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow with the London-based think-tank Chatham House\u2019s Russia and Eurasia program.",
      "\u201cSince there\u2019s little Russia can do in response in practical terms, it turns to threatening language on paper to undermine the resolve of the outgoing Biden administration.

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt widespread criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Gaza hostage crisis.",
      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",
      "Feldstein, 32, then tried to get the documents published in the media with the goal of showing that the hostage families' protests were playing into Hamas\u2019 hands, according to the prosecutors' filings, which were published Sunday.",
      "Feldstein acted \u201cwith the intention of influencing public opinion in Israel on the negotiations regarding the hostages and in particular the issue of the contribution of the demonstrations to the strengthening of Hamas,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Their filings came after Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff was questioned as part of a separate investigation into allegations that he tried to tamper with official phone logs from the day of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, a police official told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in either case and his office denies the allegations, saying it is being targeted by politically motivated security officials attempting to undermine the government.",
      "The leak investigation, referred to in Israeli media as \u201cBibiLeaks,\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s nickname \u201cBibi,\u201d was launched after the German tabloid Bild published an article in early September based on leaked Hamas documents.",
      "The newspaper claimed it had obtained documents from the personal computer of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who was subsequently killed by Israeli forces in October.",
      "The documents, according to the Bild report, showed Hamas was not interested in a quick cease-fire and believed that the protests by hostage families would weaken Israel\u2019s negotiating position.",
      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",
      "The Hostage Family Forum said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cappalled by the ongoing efforts of individuals close to the prime minister to sabotage a potential hostage deal.\u201d",
      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

      "The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times."

    "summary": "State-of-the-art technology has helped to create an avatar of the voice and face of Britain's Richard III over 500 years after his death in battle.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "One example of Lai\u2019s alleged collusion was meetings in July 2019 with then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the political crisis in Hong Kong as mass pro-democracy and anti-China protests intensified.",

      "\u201cI would not dare to ask the vice president to do anything. I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me,\u201d Lai told the court.",
      "Lai said he had asked Pompeo: \u201cNot to do something but to say something. To voice ... support for Hong Kong.\u201d",

      "\u201cTsai and myself are friends, so we always talk about U.S. policy,\u201d he told the court, explaining that he had sought in this way to set up an unofficial channel between then U.S. President Donald Trump and the Tsai administration to bolster mutual understanding.",
      "In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman said no one could engage in illegal activities and escape legal sanction.",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai is the main planner and participant in the anti-China and anti-Hong Kong incident, and is the agent and proxy of the anti-China forces,\u201d Lin Jian, told reporters in relation to Lai\u2019s trial.",

      "\u201cWe were always in support of movements for freedom,\u201d Lai, wearing a grey blazer and spectacles, told a packed courtroom. He added that he opposed Hong Kong and Taiwan independence.",

      "\u201cApple Daily was the voice of many Hong Kongers,\u201d said retiree William Wong, 64. \u201cIt\u2019s my political expression to let him (Lai) know I support him. He\u2019s done a lot for Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "Among\u00a0those\u00a0who pleaded guilty earlier to charges of conspiring with Lai were senior staffers of Apple Daily and its parent company Next Digital.",

      "Beijing imposed the national security law (NSL) in July 2020 after sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in the Asian financial hub the previous year.",

      "Many Greeks saw their wages and pensions slashed in return for bailouts worth 280 billion euros ($297 billion) during a 2009-2018 debt crisis which shaved a quarter off Greece\u2019s economic output and nearly pushed the country out of the eurozone.",
      "With the Greek economy recovering steadily since 2018, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019 center-right government has raised the minimum monthly gross wage four times since taking power in 2019 to 830 euros a month and has promised to raise it further to 950 euros by 2027.",

      "GSEE \u2014 which represents some 2.5 million workers in Greece \u2014 also asked for government action against oligopolies whom it blamed for concerted practices that drove the cost of basic goods higher.",
      "Workers were expected to protest in central Athens later on Wednesday.",
      "Mitsotakis acknowledged on Monday there was room for improvement concerning wages and GDP per capita and reiterated a call to the EU to help with discrepancies in power prices that he said saw Greeks paying far more than other countries in the bloc.",

      "During the royal couple's engagement, Mette-Marit was criticized in the media as an inappropriate choice for future queen because she had a child with a man convicted of drug possession, as well as because of her own \"wild past\" involving rumors of partying and drug-taking.",
      "Mette-Marit responded with a televised news conference the week before the 2001 wedding, at which she condemned drugs and apologized for having \"lived a dissolute life\" before she met the prince, and the media ultimately praised her for her \"Cinderella\" story.",
      "Borg H\u00f8iby has previously been in the spotlight for selling designer items on a Norwegian reselling app and listing the address as the royal palace. He played a walk-on role on a popular Norwegian teenage television show and even appeared in an American Vogue feature in 2018 giving tips on the most stylish spots to spend time in Oslo.",
