      "An upcoming edition of \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d combines the dark and singular talents of two literary giants who apparently never met: Stephen King and the late Maurice Sendak.",
      "HarperCollins Publishers announced Thursday that the King-Sendak re-imagining of the famed Brothers Grimm tale about two lost children in a frightening forest is scheduled for Sept. 2. King's words will be complemented by sketches Sendak drew up for set and costume designs for a 1997 production of the Humperdinck opera adaptation.",
      "The book was initiated by the Maurice Sendak Foundation. King, author of \u201cThe Shining,\u201d \u201cCarrie\u201d and other horror classics, said he decided to agree to the project after seeing Sendak's illustrations.",
      "\u201cTwo of his pictures in particular spoke to me: One was of the wicked witch on her broom with a bag of kidnapped children riding behind her; the other was of the infamous candy house becoming a terrible face. I thought, \u2018This is what the house really looks like, a devil sick with sin, and it only shows that face when the kids turn their backs. I wanted to write that!\u2019\" King said in a statement issued through HarperCollins.",
      "\"To me, it was the essence of this story and, really, all fairy tales: a sunny exterior, a dark and terrible center, brave and resourceful children. In a way, I have been writing about kids like Hansel and Gretel for much of my life.\u201d",
      "Representatives for King say he has no memory of meeting Sendak, although King has expressed admiration for the musical \u201cReally Rosie,\u201d a Sendak-Carole King collaboration.",
      "Lynn Caponera, the Sendak foundation's executive director, said in a statement that she thought King ideal because outside of the Grimms, \u201che's the master of scary stories and a wonderful writer to boot.\u201d",
      "Sendak, who died in 2012, spoke about Hansel and Gretel around the time he was working on the opera. In an interview published in the 2003 book \u201cThe Art of Maurice Sendak\u201d he called the fairy tale \u201cthe most profound\u201d of the Grimm canon.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, most of Grimm is about heroic children. \u2018Hansel and Gretel\u2019 are the most heroic of them all,\u201d said Sendak, known for \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d \u201cIn the Night Kitchen\u201d and other children's favorites. \"It\u2019s the toughest story in the world and people are afraid of it, yet it\u2019s famous because it\u2019s so truthful.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Warriors guard Gary Payton II said he plans on listening to the album.",
      "\u201cFor me, to be the first team to have a music company, or production company, it\u2019s kinda cool,\u201d Payton said. \u201cP-Lo is running it, and getting it done. I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.",
      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "A grand jury indicted Davis separately last week on charges of battery and challenging someone to a fight, moving that case from Justice Court to state District Court. He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.",
      "A correctional officer told grand jurors that he was escorting Davis back to his unit when he and the other man exchanged words and then started fighting in a common room, according to the Review-Journal. Davis\u2019 legal team said he was ambushed and acted in self-defense.",
      "In the Shakur case, Arnold argues that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Kierny has said Davis is not protected from prosecution because he lacks proof of any such agreements.",
      "Prosecutors say they have strong evidence against him, including his own accounts of the shooting in a tell-all memoir. Davis, an ex-gang leader, is accused of orchestrating the killing near the Las Vegas Strip."

      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for NBC Universal and the entertainment company that produced the documentary, which is also named in the suit, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The documentary premiered last month on Peacock TV, the network\u2019s streaming service.",

      "Combs, who is seeking no less than $100 million in damages, has been in Brooklyn federal prison since his September arrest on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges.",

      "Elsewhere, the complaint says the documentary delved into claims Combs had sex with underage girls, citing as evidence a civil complaint that's been \u201cthoroughly discredited.\u201d Combs\u2019 lawyers say the women referenced in that complaint have since confirmed they were adults at the time.",

      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",

      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",

      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",

      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",
      "\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Sokoloff said. \u201cI\u2019m always learning about these things the day after.\u201d",
      "McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rehearse!\u201d",
      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",

      "The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from attending an event in the Oval Office after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America",
      "NEW YORK -- The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed the Gulf of America.",
      "The reporter, whom the AP would not identify, tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Later, a second AP reporter was barred from a late-evening event in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room.",
      "The highly unusual ban, which Trump administration officials had threatened earlier Tuesday unless the AP changed the style on the Gulf, could have constitutional free-speech implications.",
      "Julie Pace, AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called the administration's move unacceptable.",
      "\u201cIt is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,\u201d Pace said in a statement. \u201cLimiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP\u2019s speech not only severely impedes the public\u2019s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the moves, and there was no indication any other journalists were affected. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media. On Friday, the administration ejected a second group of news organizations from Pentagon office space.",
      "Before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump announced plans to change the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2014 and signed an executive order to do so as soon as he was in office. Mexico\u2019s president responded sarcastically and others noted that the name change would probably not affect global usage.",
      "Besides the United States, the body of water \u2014 named the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years \u2014 also borders Mexico.",
      "The AP said last month, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that it would continue to refer to the Gulf of Mexico while noting Trump\u2019s decision to rename it as well. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP says it must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.",
      "AP style is not only used by the agency. The AP Stylebook is relied on by thousands of journalists and other writers globally.",
      "Barring the AP reporter was an affront to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the government from impeding the freedom of the press, said Tim Richardson, program director of journalism and misinformation for PEN America.",
      "The White House Correspondents Association called the White House move unacceptable and called on the administration to change course.",
      "\u201cThe White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news, nor should it penalize working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors' decision,\u201d said Eugene Daniels, WHCA's president.",
      "This week, Google Maps began using \u201cGulf of America,\" saying it had a \u201clongstanding practice\u201d of following the U.S. government\u2019s lead on such matters. The other leading online map provider, Apple Maps, was still using \u201cGulf of Mexico\" earlier Tuesday but by early evening had changed to \u201cGulf of America\" on some browsers, though at least one search produced results for both.",
      "Trump also decreed that the mountain in Alaska known as Mount McKinley and then by its Indigenous name, Denali, be shifted back to commemorating the 25th president. President Barack Obama had ordered it renamed Denali in 2015. AP said last month it will use the official name change to Mount McKinley because the area lies solely in the United States and Trump has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country.",

      "The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race",
      "NEW YORK -- The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race.",
      "Just as Edward Berger\u2019s film juggles various candidates for the papacy, the race for best picture at the Academy Awards has seen one favorite replaced by another, and then another.",
      "While some clarity has lately emerged, with a handful of big wins for Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d it seems likely to be a nail biter until a winner is declared at the March 2 Oscars, when white smoke unfurls from the Sistine Chapel, I mean the Dolby Theatre.",
      "As of now, \u201cAnora\u201d is the clear frontrunner thanks to wins with the Producers Guild and the Directors Guild \u2014 both prizes with a long history of predicting Oscar winners. Where the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs fall will offer the last major clues.",
      "But unlike years like last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was way ahead wire to wire, no lead in this year\u2019s best picture race seems ironclad. So, with that in mind, here are the best picture nominees, ranked in order of least likely to win to most likely to win. It\u2019s telling that at least half of these films, with three weeks to go, still have a chance.",
      "If this was a ranking of merit, RaMell Ross\u2019s movie would be first. Ross\u2019 film, thrillingly and thoughtfully shot largely in first person, introduced a new filmic grammar to American movies. But \u201cNickel Boys\u201d was seemingly on the cusp of getting a nomination, so we should just be glad it\u2019s counted here among the best of the year.",
      "Denis Villeneuve\u2019s first Frank Herbert adaptation garnered 10 nominations and won six. \u201cPart Two\u201d hasn\u2019t been the same awards force. It\u2019s up for five nominations and will probably walk home with one or two Oscars, possibly for visual effects and sound. People like \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d but sequels tend to have a harder go of it at the Academy Awards. Blame it on the sandworms.",
      "Arguably no film has risen up the Oscar ranks more than Walter Salles\u2019 portrait of political resistance under Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. The film, a box-office sensation in its native country, was once one of the many international underdogs vying for a place at the Academy Awards. It won\u2019t win best picture, but it\u2019s a testament to the film\u2019s appeal that it could upset \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d in best international film.",
      "Coralie Fargeat\u2019s body-horror film has turned out to be much more of an Oscar contender than initially believed \u2014 certainly by Universal, which financed the film but sold it to Mubi to distribute. It\u2019s up for five awards but its best chance comes in the best actress category where Demi Moore is the favorite. Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) and Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could make that a close call, too, but Moore \u2014 propelled by her \u201cpopcorn actress\u201d narrative and the movie's biting showbiz satire \u2014 is the frontrunner.",
      "How far can a former frontrunner fall? Jacques Audiard\u2019s narco-musical leads all films with 13 nominations but the Netflix movie has been in freefall since its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, became ensnarled by a scandal over old tweets. I\u2019m not completely counting \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d out \u2013 you don\u2019t get 13 nominations for nothing. But \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a divisive movie to begin with, is now in the business of salvaging its chances in other categories, like best supporting actress, where Zoe Salda\u00f1a could win.",
      "Now we\u2019re into the top contenders. Most likely, the winner is coming from one of these next five. Jon M. Chu\u2019s Broadway adaptation might have the most moviegoers rooting for it to win, but it\u2019s missing some key ingredients for pulling out best picture. Chu missed on a nomination for best director and the \u201cWicked\u201d has mostly been out-musical-ed by \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d on the awards circuit. Still, \u201cWicked\u201d has cornered the market on the role of Big Studio Movie contender. However it does, the film academy is going to make sure \u201cWicked\u201d is front and center during the ceremony.",
      "Here we have our Everyone Likes It contender. Berger\u2019s papal thriller, starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading a conclave, feels like the most universally respected nominee. In a year where votes are spread across a lot of films, that might be a quality that \u2014 particularly considering the academy\u2019s preferential ballot \u2014 leaves \u201cConclave\u201d driving the Oscar home in a popemobile. What\u2019s the main knock against this happening, aside from the potential difficulty of renting a popemobile? Berger was passed over on a directing nomination, and \u201cConclave\u201d hasn\u2019t yet won a major award. More than any other movie, it needs a victory at the BAFTAs.",
      "James Mangold\u2019s Bob Dylan movie is also widely liked and lacks any precursor win. But admiration for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d is widespread and it could, just as \u201cConclave\u201d might, pull out an upset by rising high on a plethora of ballots. Unlike \u201cConclave,\u201d Mangold was nominated for best director, though, and it has the benefit of being led by Hollywood\u2019s biggest young star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Hollywood likes to, in picking a best picture winner, say something about its future. Chalamet's star power could be convincing enough. Plus Searchlight Pictures has previously steered quite a few best-picture winners (\"Nomadland,\" \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d). Mangold\u2019s movie has momentum, which, even if it doesn\u2019t lead to best picture, may propel Chalamet to best actor over Adrien Brody for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Until recently, Brady Corbet\u2019s postwar epic might have been the top pick. \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has been an award-winner at Venice and the Golden Globes. It\u2019s up for 10 Oscars. It\u2019s roundly been hailed as visionary, hugely ambitious cinema \u2014 all made, remarkably, with a budget under $10 million. It\u2019s also three and a half hours long. Not every Oscar voter, I assure you, is watching it all the way through. That, though, might not be a bad thing for a movie that falls off in the second half.",
      "Half a year ago, \u201cAnora\u201d was the odds-on pick to win best picture and now, after a topsy-turvy awards season, it is again. A trio of wins \u2014 at the PGA Awards, the DGA Awards and Critics Choice \u2014 has reestablished \u201cAnora\u201d as the movie to beat.",
      "If it wins at the SAG Awards, too, the race is probably over. Not everything with similar credentials has won before, though; \u201c1917\u201d had the same wins before being defeated by \u201cParasite\u201d five years ago. \u201cAnora,\u201d however, also won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, like \u201cParasite\u201d did, so it should do well among international voters \u2014 a crucial voting bloc in today's academy.",
      "It\u2019s also just really good. \u201cAnora\u201d comes from a widely respected filmmaker in Baker, a prominent defender of the theatrical release. And his movie, a sly and devastating twist on a \u201cPretty Woman\u201d-like fable, is as connected to Hollywood's celebrated '70s as it is to its indie filmmaking present.",

      "Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy \u201cAnora\u201d took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.",
      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "But after a number of films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" \u201cAnora\u201d reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday.",
      "Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.",
      "The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.",
      "The guild also named RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys\" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.",
      "Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.",
      "Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d cleaned up with nine awards including best film. \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards."

      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "At times, her private life made news. In August 2022, she apologized after the publication of a photo that showed two women kissing and posing topless at the prime minister's official summer residence. Earlier, a video of Marin dancing and singing with friends prompted a debate about how a head of state should behave during her leisure time and whether women were held to a different standard.",

    "story": [
      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

She pointed out that vaccines are most effective when they are widespread.",

      "Despite several Republicans expressing deep skepticism about his views on vaccines, Kennedy is expected to win confirmation, absent any last-minute changes.",
      "Kennedy, 71, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views on food, chemicals and vaccines.",
      "His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them.",
      "With the backing of Republican President Donald Trump, Kennedy believes he is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health.",

While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",

      "The Trump administration's abrupt freeze in foreign aid has closed health clinics offering free care in one of Syria's most vulnerable regions",
      "SARMADA, Syria -- In the town of Sarmada in northern Syria, Dr. Mohammad Fares unlocked a clinic that once bustled with patients. Now it's empty, and shelves of medicine reduced to a few boxes of bandages and expired drugs.",
      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",
      "This part of Syria lacks centralized government healthcare, leaving people reliant on nonprofit providers and making the impact of the sudden U.S. cuts especially dire, aid workers and experts said.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",
      "In one camp that had been served by a Doctors of the World clinic, near Kawkaba village, children played among the crowded tents.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs. But Hamadeh and others said funding has not resumed to a point that would allow them to fully restore services.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shut down some of these hospitals and shrink,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be providing free services anymore.\"",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A Texas judge on Thursday fined a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas in one of the first challenges in the U.S. to \u201cshield laws\u201d enacted in Democratic-controlled states where abortion is legal.",
      "The ruling was handed down on the same day New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected a request from Louisiana to extradite the same doctor, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who was charged in that state with prescribing abortion pills to a pregnant minor.",
      "Unlike Louisiana, Texas did not file criminal charges against Carpenter but accused her in a December lawsuit of violating state law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.",
      "State District Judge Bryan Gantt issued a $100,000 fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney\u2019s fees.",
      "Earlier Hochul, a Democrat, said she will not honor Louisiana's request to arrest and send the doctor to Louisiana after she was charged with violating the southern state's strict anti-abortion law.",
      "\u201cI will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana,\u201d Hochul said at a news conference in Manhattan. \u201cNot now, not ever.\u201d",
      "She also said she sent out a notice to law enforcement in New York that instructed them to not cooperate with out-of-state warrants for such charges.",
      "The case against Carpenter appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to another state.",
      "Pills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the epicenter of political and legal fights over abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The showdown between New York and Louisiana over Carpenter is expected to result in a court case that could test New York's so-called shield law, which gives legal protections to doctors who prescribe abortion medication to conservative states where abortions are banned or otherwise limited. Other Democratic-controlled states have similar shield laws.",
      "Prosecutors in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, indicted Carpenter on charges that she violated the state's near-total abortion ban, which allows physicians convicted of performing abortions, including one with pills, to be sentenced up to 15 years in prison.",
      "Louisiana authorities said the girl who received the pills experienced a medical emergency and had to be transported to the hospital. The girl's mother was also charged and has turned herself in to police.",
      "In a videotaped statement Thursday, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said \u201cthere is only one right answer in this situation, and it is that that doctor must face extradition to Louisiana where she can stand trial and justice will be served.\u201d",
      "Landry's office did not immediately return an emailed request for comment sent after Hochul refused the extradition request."

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- After surviving teen homelessness and domestic violence in West Virginia, 23-year-old Ireland Daugherty was finally feeling stable: She had her own apartment, a job and was studying for a four-year degree.",
      "Ashley Cain, 36, was celebrating four years of sobriety and working with a nonprofit that trains workers to remediate long-abandoned factories and coal mines into sites for manufacturing and solar projects.",
      "Federally funded programs provided both women with a social safety net and employment in one of the nation\u2019s poorest states, where nonprofits play a vital role in providing basic services like health care, education and economic development.",
      "\u201cWe are a state that heavily, heavily relies on government funding,\u201d said Daugherty, who works for an organization that helps young adults transitioning out of the foster care system. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s not something that everyone wants to hear, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
      "Two weeks ago, the White House froze spending on federal loans and grants, plunging organizations across the country into uncertainty and creating chaos for nonprofits in the poorest, most rural states, like West Virginia. President Donald Trump's administration rescinded the order, but a federal appeals court found Tuesday that not all federal funding had been restored.",
      "West Virginia's reliance on federal funds to help address deeply ingrained issues makes it particularly vulnerable to the new administration's sweeping actions in a state where Trump support has run deep since his first presidency. In three elections, he has won every county.",
      "West Virginia has the nation's highest rate of opioid overdose deaths, kids in foster care, obesity and diabetes and 1 in 4 children lives in poverty. The state also has widespread infrastructure issues, from polluted drinking water to patchy broadband, and was expected to benefit heavily from federal spending packages focused on revitalizing communities.",
      "The organization Cain works for, Coalfield Development, helped leverage almost $700 million for projects tied to Biden administration spending packages, funding 1,000 jobs in West Virginia alone. It supported similar federally funded projects cleaning up abandoned mine sites and setting up solar arrays in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.",
      "Part of the nonprofit's role is to recruit and train the local workforce for projects, which is personal for CEO Jacob Hannah, who comes from three generations of coal miners and saw his father laid off from the mines.",
      "Those projects, funded by a mix of federal agencies, are now on pause indefinitely. Hannah said his organization received communications that their awards are \u201cunder review\u201d with limited details.",
      "\u201cIt's been a lot of, how do we figure out how to keep doing our work and not just sit and wait and have a death spiral?\u201d he said.",
      "In Huntington, West Virginia\u2019s second largest city, Cain and Hannah toured a former coal train refurbishment factory slated to become a manufacturing hub and business incubation space where workers should have been busy with rewiring, brick and roof repair.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like everything has culminated to the right point, but there\u2019s the starting line, and here\u2019s us,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t get to it.\u201d",
      "Cain, who went through a Coalfield Development workforce training herself, said the uncertainty has made the atmosphere at work heavier than usual.",
      "\u201cJust the awareness of what could happen has really affected people\u2019s attitudes,\u201d Cain said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that a lot of people that come here, that do face barriers, they\u2019re sometimes hopeless they\u2019re not going to be able to build a better life.\u201d",
      "In Morgantown, Daugherty was losing sleep because Libera, the nonprofit she works for, hadn't received reimbursement for a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant it uses.",
      "Daughtery, who was placed in state care at 16, said lack of support, low self-esteem, trauma and high rates of depression make the transition difficult for many.",
      "When the organization didn\u2019t receive its scheduled Jan. 31 payment, it had to freeze spending, including for a mental health program serving middle school girls.",
      "With the high need in her area, Daughtery said there are \"executive orders right now that are extremely dangerous to the way of life for West Virginians.\u201d",
      "The National Council of Nonprofits CEO and President Diane Yentel said Thursday that some organizations had seen funds restored but many others across the country were still waiting in limbo, and \u201cunfortunately, much of the confusion, chaos, and harm that the directive unleashed hasn\u2019t ended.\u201d The council was among the organizations that sued over Trump\u2019s orders.",
      "The crisis has forced some organizations into quick spending decisions that could have long-term implications.",
      "The Appalachian Center for Independent Living, which provides support to people with disabilities, let staff go, only to rehire them days later when it received a reimbursement.",
      "West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition said it spent a decade building trust with sometimes-skeptical farmers by offering technical support and helping them market their products.",
      "\u201cIf that all goes away or if that's all significantly paused, they will lose trust in us,\" Executive Director Spencer Moss said.",
      "Ryan Kelly, executive director of Rural Health Associations in Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, said he thinks the federal freeze was the wrong approach but agrees with what the Trump administration is trying to do.",
      "\u201cDiving in and trying to find the sources of waste, I think that\u2019s a very good thing,\" he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making changes, there will be problems that happen. But I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that the good will outweigh the bad and there will be some good results coming out of this.\u201d",
      "Alecia Allen, who runs a therapy practice and grocery store in a low-income neighborhood in West Virginia's capital, said lately it's felt like she has been dealing with one crisis after another.",
      "She didn't receive therapy appointment reimbursements for almost two weeks from Medicaid, which insures the majority of her patients. The delay was unusual, she said.",
      "Allen wasn't getting answers from federal agencies about the grants helping her work with farmers to provide local, healthy food to her community at a lower cost. Then a vendor she buys from to stock store shelves said her weekly bill was going up from $500 to $850 because of tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt is a huge step backwards, and it is unfortunate to have to digest every day,\" she said.",

      "A generation has passed since the peak in AIDS-related deaths",
      "A generation has passed since the world saw the peak in AIDS-related deaths. Those deaths \u2014 agonizing, from diseases the body might otherwise fight off \u2014 sent loved ones into the streets, pressuring governments to act. The United States eventually did, creating PEPFAR, arguably the most successful foreign aid program in history. HIV, which causes AIDS, is now manageable, though there is still no cure.",
      "Now the Trump administration has put the brakes on foreign aid while alleging it's wasteful, causing chaos in the system that for over 20 years has kept millions of people alive. Confusion over a temporary waiver for PEPFAR \u2014 and the difficulty of restarting its work, with U.S. workers, contractors and payments in upheaval \u2014 means the clock is ticking for many who are suddenly unable to obtain medications to keep AIDS at bay.",
      "The U.S.-led global response to HIV has been so effective that AIDS wards of people wasting away are a vision of the past. Now health experts, patients and others fear those days could return if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t reverse course or no other global power steps into the void, and fast.",
      "\u201cIn the next five years, we could have 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths,\u201d the U.N. AIDS agency told The Associated Press. That's a shock at a time of rising complacency around HIV, declining condom use among some young people and the rise of a medication that some believe could end AIDS for good.",
      "The agency has begun publicly tracking new HIV infections since the aid freeze.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what happens to the body when HIV drugs are stopped:",
      "HIV is spread by bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk or semen. It gradually weakens the body\u2019s immune system and makes it vulnerable to disease, including ones rarely seen in otherwise healthy people. The surprising emergence of such cases in the 1980s is what tipped off health experts to what became known as the AIDS epidemic.",
      "Years of intense advocacy and shocking sights of children, young adults and others dying of pneumonia and other infections led to the response that created PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Twenty million people around the world died before the program was founded. Now millions of people take drugs known as antivirals that keep HIV from spreading in the body.",
      "Stopping those drugs lets the virus start multiplying in the body again, and it could become drug-resistant. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. Babies born to mothers with HIV can escape infection only if the woman was properly treated during pregnancy or the infant is treated immediately after birth.",
      "If the drugs are not taken, a body is heading toward AIDS, the final stage of infection.",
      "\u201cWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "For a long time, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But a person can easily spread HIV to others, and the immune system becomes vulnerable to what are called opportunistic diseases.",
      "The National Institutes of Health says opportunistic diseases include fungal infections, pneumonia, salmonella and tuberculosis. For a country like South Africa, with the world\u2019s highest number of HIV cases and one of the largest numbers of TB cases, the toll could be immense.",
      "Unchecked by HIV treatment, the damage continues. The immune system is increasingly unable to fight off diseases. Every action, from eating to travel, must consider the potential exposure to germs.",
      "For years, the importance of taking the drugs every day, even at the same time of day, has been emphasized to people with HIV. Now the ability to follow that essential rule has been shaken.",
      "Already, hundreds or thousands of U.S.-funded health partners in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia have been laid off, causing widespread gaps in HIV testing, messaging, care and support on the continent most helped by PEPFAR. At some African clinics, people with HIV have been turned away.",
      "Restoring the effects caused by the Trump administration's foreign aid freeze during a 90-day review period, and understanding what\u2019s allowed under the waiver for PEPFAR, will take time that health experts say many people don't have.",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, told the AP that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "And an additional 3.4 million children could be made orphans \u2014 another echo of the time when the world raced to confront AIDS with few tools at hand.",

      "\u201cGetting the number to zero is a goal and should be our goal,\u201d Kevin Brosseau, a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a former national security and intelligence adviser, said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s one pound, 10 pounds, we all know the amount of deaths that possibly could represent. We should be focused on eliminating the scourge that is fentanyl in this country and in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "The Canadian government announced Brosseau\u2019s appointment as its fentanyl czar Tuesday.",
      "The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with an exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,\u201d said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be able to give an intensity to the work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mandate is clear, to be able to bring people together to integrate the work and produce results.\u201d",
      "Figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show the agency seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border last year. That compares to 9,570 kilograms (21,098 pounds) at the southwestern border.",

      "Brosseau said he plans on meeting with Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s border czar, and other U.S. officials soon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent a number of years working in law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how important those relationships, those collaborations are on the ground. We\u2019re stronger together.\u201d",
      "Besides appointing Brosseau, the Canadian government has also announced it is spending CDN$1.3 billion (US$910 million) on increased border security which includes new helicopters, technology and personnel.",
      "Speaking at the same event, David McGuinty, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, was asked about the challenges on dealing with President Trump.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake for people in the United States and in Canada,\u201d said McGuinty. \u201cThere is a way to find our way forward here. I think the administration knows that.\"",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take cool heads and a disciplined approach to find our way forward.\u201d",

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",

    "summary": "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state&rsquo;s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",
      "Reached by phone, South Carolina Rep. Luke Rankin, a Republican who added his name to a list of bill sponsors last week, said, \u201cI've always been pro-life.\u201d When asked about the provision to allow prosecution of women seeking abortion, he said: \u201cI can't help you there\u201d and declined to answer questions.",

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "PHOENIX -- Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them, saying the state is not capable of fixing deep failures in care even though it has been required to do so over the last decade.",
      "In a filing Tuesday, the attorneys said a takeover is urgently needed because the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry lacks the leadership to comply with changes ordered by a judge in a 2012 lawsuit over the quality of medical and mental health care for prisoners.",
      "The first constitutional violation in the case was found in 2015, they said, and \u201cA decade later, defendants still have not demonstrated the will, knowledge, or capacity to reform their prison healthcare system.\u201d",
      "Arizona settled the case in 2014 but for years was dogged by complaints that it failed to follow through on its promises. The court slapped the state with contempt fines of $1.4 million in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2021. The settlement was eventually thrown out due to Arizona\u2019s noncompliance, and a trial was ordered.",
      "In a blistering 2022 verdict, U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver ruled that the state was violating prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights by providing them with inadequate care, knew about the problem for years and refused to correct it.",
      "She also said prison health care deficiencies resulted in preventable deaths and issued an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.",
      "In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, also known as a receivership. Though Silver has previously shied away from granting that, she later said she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes.",
      "Lawyers for prisoners pointed to a recent report from a court-appointed expert who said health care for prisoners \u201cremains poor, has shown little improvement since the start of the Injunction, and continues to place the residents at significant risk of serious harm, including death.\u201d",
      "The corrections department and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs' office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the request.",
      "Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, \"Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program.\" He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries  --  often with complex health issues  --  who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid.",
      "",
      "\"Well, dual eligibles are not right now served very well into the system,\" Kennedy replied. \"And you know I suppose my answer to that is to make sure that the programs are consolidated, they're integrated, and the care is integrated. I look forward to working with you, Dr. Cassidy, on making sure that we take good care of people.\"",

      "Cassidy then asked how he proposed to integrate the programs. \"Does Medicare pay more? Medicare pay less? Medicaid pay more? Medicaid pay less? How do we do that?\"",
      "",
      "\"I'm not exactly sure, because I'm not in there. I mean, it is difficult to integrate them ...\" he replied, ultimately saying, \"I do not know the answer to that. I look forward to exploring options.\"",

      "Kennedy also said that Medicare beneficiaries would \"rather be on Medicare Advantage because it offers very good services. People can't afford it. It's much more expensive.\"",

      "In fact, MA plan beneficiaries generally pay no or very low premiums and choose their plans because of low or non-existent upfront costs. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare  --  $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.",
      "",
      "At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is \"fully paid for by the federal government,\" when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. That's an important concept to understand, since each Medicaid program's coverage and eligibility requirements can vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs run by HHS agencies.",

That memo directed agency heads to submit no later than February 7 plans that will \"describe the steps the agency will take to revise telework agreements for all eligible employees including major milestones for implementation\" and \"provide timelines for the return of all eligible employees to in-person work as expeditiously as possible.\" Agencies must also explain their plans for getting those who are working remotely full-time back to the office, especially those who live more than 50 miles from their duty stations, and outline any exceptions they intend to grant.",
      "",
      "Trump is not alone in his antipathy to teleworking for federal workers. Last December, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) released a report stating that only 6% of federal workers were in the office full-time; the report was titled \"Out of Office: Bureaucrats on the beach and in bubble baths but not in office buildings.\" Ernst's percentage was very much at odds with a 2024 OMB report  --  which has since been removed from the OMB website  --  that found that 54% of federal employees work in the office full-time, while the other 46% of the federal workforce is telework eligible, according to a story on the Meritalk website. Only 10% of federal employees \u2013 228,000 people \u2013 are in fully remote jobs.",
      "",
      "Generally Popular With Both Parties",
      "",
      "Overall, however, telework actually has been popular on both sides of the aisle, Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said last month on a phone call with reporters: \"There has been bipartisan support for telework in the federal space for many, many years, because it's been shown to  --  when well-applied  --  provide both for better performance and improved ability to recruit the best talent for federal positions.\" The Partnership for Public Service says its aim is to build \"a better government and a stronger democracy.\"",
      "",
      "In the past few years, \"there's obviously been a push to try to move people in the federal space back into the office,\" Stier continued. \"The Biden administration actually pushed aggressively to try to make that happen. ... Some organizations like the Patent and Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",
      "",
      "The in-office order comes as the General Services Administration announced plans to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint. \"One of the things that our government has become is more efficient with respect to cost, in terms of its physical footprint, as a result of increased use of telework and remote work,\" said Stier. \"So those things do run in conflict with each other, and certainly it's so important to understand the transition needs of any organization.\"",
      "",
      "Like everyone else in the federal workforce, HHS's more than 80,000 employees  --  several of whom spoke to MedPage Today on condition of anonymity  --  are trying to figure out how the back-to-work order will be implemented in their specific situation. The agency consists of workers assigned to the HHS headquarters office in Washington as well as 10 regional offices spread throughout the U.S., and lingering logistical questions remain. Some who have previously worked at the Washington headquarters, for example, say there is likely not enough interior space or parking to accommodate all of the employees if everyone now assigned there were to return full-time.",

      "One employee working in a different location said they had heard that supervisors were going to have to return to work full-time sooner than non-supervisory employees, and that there might still be some \"ad hoc\" telework agreements. There may not be enough space for everyone to be in their building, the employee said.",
      "",
      "Still another employee said that their colleagues were \"none too pleased\" to hear about the back-to-office-full-time requirement, noting that the rule appeared to supersede other arrangements in which people could, for instance, work four 10-hour days and get the fifth day off. \"This is an imperious, dictatorial, tin-ear approach to management,\" the person said. \"It's not about efficiency; it's just about vindictiveness. There are ways to achieve the overall goal of serving the American people well, but this is not that.\"",
      "",
      "Changes to Work/Life Balance",
      "",
      "With this change, \"people's work/life balance is about to be completely tipped over,\" the person continued. They noted that \"the flexibility of remote work allowed them to create lives where they were much more productive as parents and still got their work done; if they had to do a carpool at 3 p.m., they could do that and work into the evening. I would get emails from people who were still working at 7 or 8 p.m. But you can't do that if you're in the office 5 days a week with inflexible workplace rules.\"",
      "",
      "Another employee said that telework made it easier to work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, \"it would take me an hour to get into work in the morning and maybe 90 minutes or longer to get home in the afternoon,\" they said, explaining that they worked a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift. But with telework, \"I could work before 7 or after 3:30, and that has happened commonly  --  things come up and require more than just the 8 hours that you do on Monday through Friday.\"",

      "One thing that might affect whether and when HHS employees return to the office full-time is any collective bargaining agreements that employee unions have with the federal government. \"In the OPM memo, they indicated that there were some issues that need to be resolved through the collective bargaining process before employees that were represented by the unions could actually return to the office,\" the employee added.

      "Lawmakers in El Salvador have taken advantage of a newly streamlined constitutional reform process to eliminate public financing of political campaigns, making good on a promise of President Nayib Bukele",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Lawmakers in El Salvador took advantage of a newly streamlined constitutional reform process to eliminate public financing of political campaigns Wednesday, making good on a promise of President Nayib Bukele.",
      "The reform passed with 58 of the Congress\u2019 60 lawmakers voting in favor \u2013 carried largely by Bukele\u2019s allies\u2019 supermajority. The legislation now goes to Bukele for his signature.",
      "\u201cPolitical parties can finance themselves like we financed ourselves in 2019,\u201d Bukele wrote on X. \u201cDifficult? Yes, it was difficult. But wasn\u2019t it better that way?\u201d",
      "Political parties had received money from the government based on the number of votes they obtain in elections, or had to return money that was advanced if their vote totals fall short of expectations.",
      "Last month, the Congress ratified the change to the process for reforming the constitution. Previously, constitutional reforms had to be proposed and approved in one legislature, then ratified in the subsequent Congress following elections.",
      "Now, reforms can be swept through with just the vote of three quarters of legislators. Bukele\u2019s New Ideas party holds 54 seats and its allies three more in the 60-seat unicameral Congress.",
      "His party\u2019s success has already nearly erased the public participation of the opposition parties that had ruled El Salvador for decades before he began his first term in 2019.",
      "\u201cThe elimination of public financing is another measure to consolidate and maintain the system of a hegemonic or dominant party,\u201d said Eduardo Escobar, of the civic group Citizen Action. \u201cThe reform will affect political pluralism, now that the majority of parties won\u2019t be able to pay for their ordinary functions, nor their electoral campaigns, reducing the possibility of an electoral victory.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's abrupt freeze in foreign aid has closed health clinics offering free care in one of Syria's most vulnerable regions",
      "SARMADA, Syria -- In the town of Sarmada in northern Syria, Dr. Mohammad Fares unlocked a clinic that once bustled with patients. Now it's empty, and shelves of medicine reduced to a few boxes of bandages and expired drugs.",
      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",
      "This part of Syria lacks centralized government healthcare, leaving people reliant on nonprofit providers and making the impact of the sudden U.S. cuts especially dire, aid workers and experts said.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",
      "In one camp that had been served by a Doctors of the World clinic, near Kawkaba village, children played among the crowded tents.",
      "Camp director Abdelkareem Khaled said the suspension of aid has exacerbated already difficult conditions.",
      "\u201cPatients, especially those who need medicine every month, can no longer afford it at the pharmacy,\u201d he said, leaving those with chronic diseases like diabetes with wrenching decisions to make.",
      "In one tent, Bassam Hussein, father of 4 daughters. said he was forced to pull his 12-year-old daughter out of school so she could work in an almond field to help pay for the medicine he uses for his thyroid illness.",
      "\u201cEvery twenty days, I need a pack of medicine that costs $12,\u201d he said, \"If I don\u2019t secure the cost of the medicine, I experience complications \u2014 weakness, depression and so on.\u201d He said he was unable to work because of past injuries and illnesses.",
      "Other organizations are in limbo. Some have continued providing services without knowing where they will find the money.",
      "Dr. Mufaddal Hamadeh, president of the Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals and mobile clinics across the north, said some services had to continue, such as the maternity ward and incubators. But it's unclear how long that will remain sustainable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not certain if we\u2019ll get a waiver or reimbursement for the expenses we\u2019ve already covered,\" he said, referring to the U.S. government. \u201dThat already put a huge financial burden on us.\u201d He refused to give details.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs. But Hamadeh and others said funding has not resumed to a point that would allow them to fully restore services.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shut down some of these hospitals and shrink,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be providing free services anymore.\"",
      "Some programs, such as mental health support for refugees in Turkey and an autism center for children, may not be deemed life-saving.",
      "\u201cWe have a grant that supports survivors of torture and sexual assault,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cAre these services life-saving or not? Likely they will be shut down.\u201d",
      "USAID and the U.S. government did not respond to questions. Elsewhere, USAID workers and aid officials have said funding hasn't resumed despite waivers, or USAID staffers who would process them are now gone.",
      "SAMS relies on USAID for about 25 to 30% of its funds. It's significant, but some other organizations working in Syria receive much more.",
      "Doctors of the World's Istanbul office, which oversees operations in northern Syria, was receiving 60% of its funding from USAID.",
      "Sitting in a new, downsized office, Turkish branch director Hakan Bilgin recalled the day they were told to halt services.",
      "\u201cWe just received the stop-work order suddenly. Nobody was expecting it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a medical organization providing life-saving services, you\u2019re basically telling us: Close all the clinics, stop all your doctors, and you\u2019re not providing services to women, children, and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Bilgin said his group has cut its daily consultations across northern Syria from 5,000 to 500. The organization has applied for a waiver from the U.S. but has received no response.",
      "Trump and Elon Musk, who runs what is billed as a cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have taken aim at various government agencies. But USAID has been hit the hardest, with Trump and Musk accusing the agency\u2019s work of being out of line with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Hamadeh, the SAMS president, said the aid cuts are short-sighted and could harm Washington's standing abroad.",
      "\u201cThis money is helping people, saving lives,\" he said. \"You can\u2019t just shut down USAID, which has helped millions across the world and actually did help improve America\u2019s reputation.\u201d",
      "Northwest Syria has been devastated by years of war and neglect, he said. \u201cPulling the plug over that will just increase the suffering.\u201d",

      "Thailand's army says some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar",
      "BANGKOK -- Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand's army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, first is to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",

      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's speech on Ukraine this week has thrown NATO into disarray",
      "BRUSSELS -- In just one speech by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week, the most powerful member of NATO has thrown the world\u2019s biggest military alliance into disarray, raising troubling questions about America\u2019s commitment to European security.",
      "Hegseth told almost 50 of Ukraine \u2019s Western backers on Wednesday that he had joined their meeting \u201cto directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must \u2014 and we are \u2014 focusing on security of our own borders,\u201d he said.",
      "Reading the riot act to U.S. allies, Hegseth said that Ukraine will not get all its territory back from Russia and will not be allowed to join NATO, which would provide the ultimate security guarantee to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin never attacks it again.",
      "He insisted NATO will not be involved in any future force that might be required to police the peace in Ukraine. European and other nations will, but the Europeans will have to pay for it. No American troops would take part in such an operation, he warned.",
      "Beyond that, Hegseth said that NATO will not come to the rescue of any European nation involved in that force if it is attacked by Russia. It\u2019s unclear what role the U.S. would play, if any, although Russia is sure to test the force\u2019s resolve if America does not provide backup.",
      "French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said that NATO faces \u201ca real moment of truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo say that it\u2019s the biggest and most robust alliance in history is true, historically speaking. But the real question is will that still be the case in 10 or 15 years,\u201d he said.",
      "Founded in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed by 12 nations to counter the threat to European security posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Dealing with Moscow is in its DNA. Keeping the peace outside the Euro-Atlantic area is not.",
      "NATO\u2019s ranks have grown since the Washington Treaty was signed 75 years ago \u2014 to 32 countries after Sweden joined last year, worried by an increasingly aggressive Russia.",
      "NATO\u2019s collective security guarantee \u2014 Article 5 of the treaty \u2014 underpins its credibility.",
      "It\u2019s a political commitment by all member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. Hegseth has now raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to that pledge, although he did say that his country is not planning to leave the alliance.",
      "NATO\u2019s doors are open to any European country that wants to join and can meet the requirements and obligations. Importantly, NATO takes its decisions by consensus, so every member has a veto. This week, Hegseth took Ukraine\u2019s candidacy off the table.",
      "The United States is the most powerful member. It spends much more on defense than any other ally and far outweighs its partners in terms of military muscle. So Washington drives the agenda. Hegseth\u2019s speech, essentially saying \u201cthis is how it\u2019s going to be,\u201d was further proof.",
      "NATO\u2019s day-to-day work is led by former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.",
      "As NATO\u2019s top civilian official, he chairs almost weekly meetings of ambassadors in the North Atlantic Council at its Brussels headquarters. He chairs other \u201cNACs\u201d at ministerial level and summits of heads of state and government. Rutte runs NATO HQ, tries to encourage consensus and speaks on behalf of all 32 members.",
      "NATO\u2019s military headquarters is based nearby in Mons, Belgium. It is always run by a top U.S. officer. The current supreme allied commander Europe is Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli.",
      "Even though most allies believe that Russia could pose an existential threat to Europe, NATO itself is not arming Ukraine. As an organization, NATO possesses no weapons of any kind. Collectively, the alliance provides only non-lethal support \u2014 fuel, combat rations, medical supplies and body armor, as well as equipment to counter drones or mines.",
      "But members do send arms on their own or in groups. European allies provided 60% of the military support that Ukraine received in 2024.",
      "NATO has also helped Ukraine\u2019s armed forces shift from Soviet-era military doctrine to modern thinking, and has strengthened Ukraine\u2019s defense and security institutions.",
      "Much of what NATO does for Ukraine, and indeed for global security, is misunderstood. Often the alliance is thought of as the sum of all U.S. relations with its European partners, from imposing sanctions and other costs on Russia to sending arms and ammunition.",
      "But as an organization, its brief is limited to the defense by military means of its 32 member countries \u2014 the sacred Three Musketeers-like vow of all for one, one for all \u2014 and a commitment to help keep the peace in Europe and North America.",
      "At least that was the case until this week.",
      "While some allies have left open the possibility of sending military personnel to Ukraine, NATO itself has no plans to do this, and Hegseth ended any speculation over whether it might.",
      "But a key part of the commitment for allies to defend one another is to deter Russia, or any other adversary, from launching an attack in the first place. Finland and Sweden joined NATO recently because of this concern.",

      "The aim was for each ally to be spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense within a decade. In 2023, they agreed to make 2% a spending floor, rather than a ceiling. A record 23 countries were expected reach that spending target last year, up from only three a decade ago.",

      "Western allies and Arab countries are gathering in Paris for an international conference on Syria to discuss the country\u2019s future after the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad and amid uncertainty over the United States commitment to the region",
      "PARIS -- Western allies and Arab countries are gathering in Paris on Thursday for an international conference on Syria to discuss the country\u2019s future after the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad and amid uncertainty over the United States' commitment to the region.",
      "It\u2019s the third conference on Syria since Assad was ousted in December, and the first since President Donald Trump's administration took over in the U.S.",
      "Trump's controversial decision to freeze foreign assistance has raised concerns in Syria, a country that had depended on hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the U.S. and now left in ruins by a civil war.",
      "The Trump administration is pulling almost all USAID workers out of the field worldwide, all but ending a six-decade mission meant to shore up American security by fighting starvation, funding education and working to end epidemics.",
      "While many Syrians were happy to see the rule of Assad come to an abrupt end in December, analysts have warned that the honeymoon period for the country\u2019s new rulers may be short-lived if they are not able to jumpstart the country\u2019s battered economy.",
      "An end to the sanctions imposed during Assad\u2019s time will be key to that, but sanctions are not the only issue.",
      "More aid is crucial to achieve a peaceful reconstruction during the post-Assad transition. The country needs massive investment to rebuild housing, electricity, water and transportation infrastructure after nearly 14 years of war. The United Nations in 2017 estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion, while some experts now say the number could reach at least $400 billion.",
      "With few productive sectors and government employees making wages equivalent to about $20 per month, Syria has grown increasingly dependent on remittances and humanitarian aid. But the flow of aid was throttled after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month.",
      "The effects were particularly dire in the country\u2019s northwest, a formerly rebel-held enclave that hosts millions of people displaced from other areas by the country\u2019s civil war. Many of them live in sprawling tent camps.",
      "The freeze on USAID funding forced clinics serving many of those camps to shut down, and nonprofits laid off local staff. In northeastern Syria, a camp housing thousands of family members of Islamic State fighters was thrown into chaos when the group providing services there was forced to briefly stop work.",
      "A workshop bringing together key donors from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, the United Nations and key agencies from Arab countries will be held alongside the conference to coordinate international aid to Syria.",
      "Uncertainty also surrounds the future of U.S. military support in the region.",
      "In 2019 during his first term, Trump decided on a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops form the northeast of Syria before he halted the plans. And in December last year, when rebels were on their way to topple Assad, Trump said the United States should not \u201c dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.\u201d",
      "Now that Syria\u2019s new leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is trying to consolidate his power, the U.S intentions in the region remain unclear.",
      "A French diplomatic official confirmed the presence of a U.S. representative at the conference, but said \u201cour understanding is that the new U.S. administration is still in the review process regarding Syria, it does not seem (the U.S. position) will be clarified at that conference.\u201d The official spoke anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices.",
      "The commander of the main U.S.-backed force in Syria recently said that U.S. troops should stay in Syria because the Islamic State group will benefit from a withdrawal.",
      "Since Damascus fell on Dec. 8 and Assad fled to Moscow, the new leadership has yet to lay out a clear vision of how the country will be governed.",
      "The Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2013 a former al-Qaida affiliate that the EU and U.N. consider to be a terrorist organization \u2013 has established itself as Syria\u2019s de facto rulers after coordinating with the southern fighters during the offensive late last year.",
      "French organizers said the three main goals of the meeting, which is not a pledging conference, are to coordinate efforts to support a peaceful transition, organize cooperation and aid from neighbours and partners, and to continue talks on the fight against impunity.",
      "The conference takes place at ministerial level. Syria's interim foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani has been invited and it will be his first visit to Europe.",
      "Speaking this week at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, al-Shibani underlined the new government in Damascus\u2019 desire to improve relations with the West and get sanctions on Syria lifted so the country could start rebuilding after the ruinous, 14-year war.",

      "While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and strandings have become a recurring issue in the last decade.",

      "Work to give London yet another skyscraper has uncovered traces of the city\u2019s origins almost 2,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Work to give 21st-century London yet another skyscraper has uncovered traces \u2014 in fact chunks \u2014 of the city\u2019s origins almost 2,000 years ago.",
      "Archaeologists exploring the site of a planned 32-story office tower announced Thursday that they have unearthed the remains of a Roman basilica that once stood at the heart of the city known as Londinium.",
      "Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished for the tower at 85 Gracechurch Street uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations, up to 1 meter (over 3 feet) wide, 4 meters (13 feet) deep and two millennia old.",
      "Sophie Jackson of Museum of London Archaeology called it \u201cone of the most significant discoveries\u201d in years in London\u2019s oldest quarter, the City \u2014 the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and even earlier structures.",
      "What\u2019s been uncovered are the foundations of a two-story building, almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded Britain and some 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.",
      "The basilica was part of the forum, the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London, where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city\u2019s governance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the beating heart of the city,\u201d said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. \u201cIt kind of towers above the city. And so it\u2019s a real symbol of Roman power and authority.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the early stages of London here, but it\u2019s a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy,\u201d he said.",
      "Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center.",
      "Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the \u201cabsolutely massive\u201d foundations discovered in several test pits suggests an \u201cextraordinary\u201d level of preservation.",
      "Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses \u2014 even ancient trash \u2014 could give glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners.",
      "Property developers in Britain routinely have to consult archaeologists as part of their planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Saxon jewelry to medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims.",
      "The latest discovery adds to the scant traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of ancient wall, a portion of amphitheater beneath the Guildhall and a temple to the god Mithras which lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg.",
      "\"We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,\u201d Henderson-Schwartz said. \u201cBut this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.\u201d",

      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, will have to serve at least 18 years in prison before he can be considered for release, a Fiji High Court registry official in Lautoka said.",
      "Dawson was convicted in December of murdering his wife, Christe Chen, who was then 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in the South Pacific nation. He then fled by kayak to a nearby island.",
      "He was sentenced by Justice Riyaz Hamza on Wednesday.",

      "Dawson pleaded not guilty to the charge and was tried over eight days.",
      "His lawyer Anil Prasad told the court that prosecutors had failed provide sufficient evidence to convict Dawson, the Fijian Broadcasting Corp. reported.",
      "Prasad said that while the prosecution alleged that Dawson was planning to flee Fiji, authorities failed to acknowledge that many of the couple\u2019s personal belongings remained at the resort.",

      "This Valentine's Day Kenya's flower industry is being ravaged by pests, leading some flower farmers to rely more heavily on toxic pesticides",
      "ISINYA, Kenya -- The red rose: a token of love for many, and for Kenya, a major economic sector. More than a third of Kenya's flower exports where the roses, in particular, are prized for their longevity and vase performance, the Kenyan government says.",
      "What can\u2019t be seen within these uniformly perfect blooms is a tiny larva laid inside the rosebuds, laid by the false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta), which doesn\u2019t just feed on roses but can also affect fruits and vegetables.",
      "The moth has been devastating crops across Africa. The European Union is intensifying measures to prevent its spread into Europe, classifying FCM among organisms targeted for regulation as quarantine pests, with consequences for hard-pressed Kenyan farmers.",
      "According to the Kenya Flower Council, the detection of a single live FCM at any developmental stage leads to the rejection of an entire flower consignment.",
      "\u201cThey are too strict,\u201d laments Jacky Mwanzia, a marketer with Isinya Roses in Kajiado County, south of Nairobi. \u201cMost of our shipments to the EU are quarantined, and it takes time. It is a waste because we have to meet customers\u2019 demand, so we are looking for alternative markets where these measures are not too strict, as we lose about 30% of our revenue.\u201d",
      "Nationally, the flower industry employs half a million people, according to a Central Bank of Kenya 2021 report, and is estimated by the National Bureau of Statistics to be worth over $800 million. Roses make up about 66% of cut flower exports, at an estimated value of about $300 million.",
      "The Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) reports that since 2020, EU sampling of Kenyan roses has increased from 5% to 25%, leading to more frequent quarantines and shipment returns.",
      "Despite existing stringent protocols, the EU is expected to enforce even tougher restrictions in the coming months. Due to ongoing noncompliance by exporters, the EU will impose special requirements applicable to Kenyan cut roses, reports the Committee Linking Entrepreneurship, Agriculture, and Development, a French-based network of companies that engages in sustainable agriculture. These new rules take effect on Apr. 26, 2025.",
      "Kenya\u2019s warm climate and soils are ideal for growing roses but also favor pests, so pesticides are routinely used to minimize losses. A 2020 study by the Route To Food Initiative of the Nairobi branch of the Heinrich Boell Foundation, a non-profit, found that 75% of pesticides used in Kenya are highly hazardous. Nearly half are banned in the EU but are still used in Kenya largely due to lower regulatory standards.",
      "Farmers who want to export to the EU have to stay within the bloc's pesticide regulations while also trying to control FCM populations. It can be a tricky balancing act.",
      "\u201cThe EU has a strict zero tolerance on caterpillars and on several chemicals that, given the current weather conditions, we must use. Otherwise, we cannot meet our production targets,\u201d says Anantha Kumar, marketing manager at Isinya Roses. The company is a major local employer, with a workforce of up to 1,000 people, depending on seasonal demand.",
      "As a result, the company is now eyeing other markets with less stringent regulations. \u201cThe Middle East market is ready to accept our products, and it is really growing,\u201d Kumar says.",
      "In spite of the challenges, the growers at Isinya Roses are not ready to abandon the European market just yet. They are trying natural pest control methods, including releasing beneficial insects, companion planting, using pheromone traps, and applying natural fertilizers and composting instead of chemical fertilizers.",
      "But this year, flower farmers will likely face a challenging Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day, which are usually peak sales periods for cut flowers around the world.",

      "Armed men perpetrated the rapes but it was unclear what specific armed group or army they belonged to, Gutcher said. \u201cIt is suspected that all parties to the conflict committed sexual violence,\u201d she added.",

In late January, the rebels captured Goma, the region\u2019s largest city, in a major escalation of the fighting.",

      "MUNICH -- Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the U.S. delegation to the Munich Security Conference that starts Friday in the southern German city, where world leaders and diplomats are gathering amid intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy.",
      "The future of Ukraine will be the top item on the agenda following a phone call between President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
      "Vance and Rubio are expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday for talks that many \u2014 particularly in Europe \u2014 hope will shed at least some light on Trump\u2019s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.",
      "Rubio, however, was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich. The State Department spokeswoman said he would take a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump, who upended years of steadfast U.S. support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions \u2014 other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.",
      "\u201cThe Ukraine war has to end,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday. \u201cYoung people are being killed at levels that nobody\u2019s seen since World War II. And it\u2019s a ridiculous war.\u201d",
      "The Russia-Ukraine war is the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II. Vance arrived in Munich on Thursday and started his visit with a tour of the nearby Dachau concentration camp memorial.",
      "\u201cI really am really moved by this site,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd I think that while it is, of course, a place of unspeakable atrocity and terror and evil, it\u2019s very important that it\u2019s here, and it\u2019s very important that those of us who are lucky enough to be alive and can walk around, can know what happened here and commit ourselves to do everything to prevent it from happening again.\u201d",
      "Asked if the tour had inspired any reflection on either the conflict in Ukraine or the war in Gaza, Vance demurred.",
      "Trump\u2019s undetailed musings have left Europeans in a quandary, wondering how \u2014 or even if \u2014 they can maintain the post-WWII security that NATO afforded them or fill the gap in the billions of dollars of security assistance that the Biden administration provided to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion.",
      "Trump has been highly skeptical of that aid and is expected to cut or otherwise limit it as negotiations get underway in the coming days.",
      "\u201cThere can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine\u2019s voice must be at the heart of any talks,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters at NATO headquarters, as the alliance\u2019s 32 defense ministers met for talks on the war-torn country.",
      "Trump was noncommittal on Wednesday about whether Ukraine would have a seat at the table in U.S. negotiations with Russia. But asked by reporters Thursday, Trump said, \u201cOf course they would. I mean, they\u2019re part of it. We would have Ukraine, we have Russia and we\u2019ll have other people involved, too.\u201d",
      "He also noted that representatives from Russia would be at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth dashed Ukraine\u2019s hopes this week of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was \u201cirreversible,\u201d or getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any way that a country in Russia\u2019s position could allow ... them to join NATO,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d",
      "Asked what he thought Russia should give up to reach a deal, he noted that talks have not yet begun and that \u201cmaybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At NATO headquarters, Hegseth reiterated Thursday that \u201csimply pointing out realism like the borders won\u2019t be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin.\u201d He said it\u2019s a recognition of realities on the ground.",
      "He added, though, that neither Russia nor Ukraine will \u201cget everything that they want\u201d and stressed that \u201cany negotiation that\u2019s had will be had with both.\u201d",
      "Rubio also told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in a call before leaving for Munich that the U.S. was committed to Ukrainian independence. He reiterated \u201cthe need for bold diplomacy to end the war in a negotiated manner leading to a sustainable peace,\u201d according to a State Department readout.",
      "The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy\u2019s fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that the Biden administration had provided.",
      "The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was \u201cnot very pleasant\u201d that the American president spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to \u201cnot allow everything to go according to Putin\u2019s plan.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,\u201d Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine.",
      "The track Trump is taking also has rocked Europe, much as his dismissive comments about France and Germany did during his first term.",
      "French Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Haddad described Europe as being at a turning point, with the ground shifting rapidly under its feet, and said Europe must wean itself off its reliance on the United States for its security. He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re not sufficiently grasping the extent to which our world is changing. Both our competitors and our allies are busy accelerating,\u201d Haddad told broadcaster France Info on Thursday.",

      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is putting up a desperate fight for his political life at Seoul\u2019s Constitutional Court after being impeached and arrested for his short-lived imposition of martial law last year",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is putting up a desperate fight for his political life at Seoul\u2019s Constitutional Court after being impeached and arrested for his short-lived imposition of martial law last year. After weeks of hearings, the court is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal saga, which also includes a separate criminal indictment on rebellion charges, has become a stress test for the country\u2019s democracy, which has been challenged by deepening political polarization and distrust.",
      "Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at a Seoul court that authorized his arrest; his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions; and Yoon has continued to express contempt for his liberal rivals, endorsing baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud to justify his ill-fated authoritarian push.",
      "If Yoon is dismissed, that would trigger a presidential by-election that could test voters\u2019 trust in the electoral process, while a decision to reinstate him could fuel further instability if the public see it as unjust.",
      "The Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling, expected by March, will be a crucial moment for South Korea. Here's a look at how it's being decided.",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the National Assembly has the power to impeach presidents but not to remove them from office. After an impeachment, the president's powers are temporarily suspended and a trial begins at the Constitutional Court. The court has 180 days to either remove Yoon from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If he\u2019s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.",
      "The Assembly made specific charges against Yoon when impeaching him \u2014 misusing military force, circumventing legal processes to declare a state of emergency, and attempting to disband the legislature \u2014 but the court is only required to rule on whether or not he can remain in office. Removing Yoon would need the votes of six of the court\u2019s eight justices.",
      "Yoon faces criminal accusations of attempted rebellion over his short-lived declaration of martial law, but the Constitutional Court is focusing on a relatively simple question: whether he had legitimate grounds to declare martial law on Dec. 3.",
      "The constitution limits the exercise of that power to times of war or comparable national emergencies.",
      "Yoon has argued that his martial law decree was necessary to overcome the \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition, which he claims improperly used its legislative majority to block his agenda.",
      "After winning a landslide victory in last year's legislative elections, the liberal opposition impeached several of Yoon's key officials and blocked his budget bill. Yoon's side says those moves created a crisis that required drastic action.",
      "But Yoon\u2019s National Security Director Shin Won-shik told the Constitutional Court on Tuesday that Yoon began floating the idea of using his emergency powers before the general elections in April.",
      "The National Assembly has also said that Yoon sidestepped a constitutional requirement to deliberate in a formal meeting of the Cabinet before declaring martial law.",
      "Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, but most participants, including Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, have said the gathering did not qualify as a meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation.",
      "The meeting also failed to follow legal procedures required for formal state council meetings: no agenda was proposed, no signatures were collected from participants and no minutes were recorded. Yoon told the court Tuesday that he thought the records could be produced later through electronic approval.",
      "Several top officials, including Han, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, said they attempted to talk Yoon out of the decision, citing potential damage to the country\u2019s international reputation and economy.",
      "But Yoon went ahead with the martial law declaration, saying that his \u201cperception of the situation\u201d was different, according to public prosecutors\u2019 criminal indictments of Yoon and his former Defense Minister, Kim Yong Hyun, who played a key role in the events.",
      "Former Interior and Safety Minister Lee Sang-min, one of Yoon\u2019s closest allies, is the only participant who has said the Dec. 3 Cabinet meeting had substance, telling the court on Tuesday that officials engaged in \u201cpassionate debates.\u201d Yoon has said that it makes \u201cabsolutely no sense to suggest that Cabinet members came to the presidential office just for an informal meeting or to hang out.\u201d",
      "Finally, the Assembly accused Yoon of attempting to dissolve the legislature, something that is beyond his constitutional powers even under martial law.",
      "A military decree that followed Yoon\u2019s declaration stated that \u201call political activities are prohibited, including activities of the National Assembly and local councils,\u201d and hundreds of troops were deployed to the National Assembly, including special operation units who broke windows while unsuccessfully attempting to reach the main chamber.",
      "Legislators managed to assemble a quorum in the chamber despite the assault and voted unanimously to lift the state of martial law.",
      "Yoon and his lawyers have maintained that the martial law declaration was intended as a temporary and \u201cpeaceful\u201d warning to the liberal opposition, and that he had always planned to respect lawmakers' will if they voted to lift the measure.",
      "He said the troops were there to maintain order, not to disrupt the legislature.",
      "But the Assembly has pointed to testimonies by some military commanders, who have described a deliberate attempt to seize the legislature that was thwarted by hundreds of civilians and legislative staff who helped lawmakers enter the assembly, and by the troops\u2019 reluctance or refusal to follow Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "Yoon\u2019s claims have been contradicted by testimony from Kwak Jong-keun, the now-arrested commander of the Army Special Warfare Command. Kwak said the president directly instructed him to have troops pull the lawmakers out, desperate to prevent the 300-member Assembly from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn his martial law order. Yoon has denied accusations that he sought to arrest key politicians and election officials.",
      "In addition to surrounding the legislature, hundreds of other troops were sent to National Election Commission offices the same day. Yoon says he was aiming to investigate election fraud allegations, which remain unsubstantiated."

      "Alternative for Germany appears to be heading for its strongest national election result yet this month and is fielding its first candidate to lead the country",
      "BERLIN -- Alternative for Germany appears to be heading for its strongest national election result yet this month and is fielding its first candidate to lead the country. Even though it's highly unlikely to take a share of power soon, it has become a factor that other politicians can't ignore and helped shape Germany's debate on migration.",
      "The far-right party first entered Germany's national parliament eight years ago on the back of discontent with the arrival of large numbers of migrants in the mid-2010s, and curbing migration remains its signature theme. But the party has proven adept at harnessing discontent with other issues: Germany's move away from fossil fuels, restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and support for Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion nearly three years ago.",
      "Alternative for Germany, or AfD, was founded in 2013 and initially focused on opposition to bailouts for struggling countries in the eurozone debt crisis \u2014 measures that then Chancellor Angela Merkel described as \u201cwithout alternative.\u201d It was sometimes known as a \u201cparty of professors,\u201d a reference to leading figures in the early days, though it already had a strong streak of hard-right, anti-establishment identity.",
      "Over the years, AfD became more radical and repeatedly changed leaders. It was Merkel's decision in 2015 to allow in large numbers of migrants that supercharged it as a political force, and in the 2017 national election, it won 12.6% of the vote to take seats in the German parliament for the first time.",
      "After returning to parliament in 2021 with reduced support of 10.3%, AfD picked up strength as Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left government bickered through a series of crises \u2014 some of its own making \u2014 and finally collapsed.",
      "Germany saw a wave of protests a year ago triggered by a report that right-wing extremists met to discuss the deportation of millions of immigrants, including some with German citizenship, and that AfD members were present.",
      "But that didn't do long-term poll damage to AfD. It finished second in the European Parliament election in June, and in September, the best-known figure on its hardest-right wing, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, secured the first far-right win in a state election in post-World War II Germany.",
      "AfD is going into this election with renewed confidence and radical language. Alice Weidel, its first candidate for chancellor, has embraced the term \u201cremigration\u201d as the party calls for large-scale deportations of people with no legal entitlement to be in Germany \u2014 a politically loaded word that featured in last year's controversy.",
      "AfD calls for the immediate lifting of sanctions against Russia and opposes weapons deliveries to Ukraine. It wants Germany to reintroduce a national currency and for the European Union to be turned into a looser \u201cassociation of European nations,\u201d though it isn't explicitly advocating leaving the 27-nation bloc.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency has the party under observation for suspected right-wing extremism. The AfD's branches in three eastern states are designated \u201cproven right-wing extremist\u201d groups. AfD strongly objects to those assessments and rejects any association with the Nazi past. H\u00f6cke has appealed two convictions for knowingly using a Nazi slogan at a political event.",
      "AfD has support across Germany and is represented in all but two of the 16 state legislatures, but the party is strongest in the formerly communist and less prosperous east.",
      "It has a unique ability to seize on issues \u201cthat other parties don't handle with this clarity, with this intensity, with this radicalism and this emotionality,\u201d said Wolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the Berlin Social Science Center. \u201cAnd on top of that, it's an internet party and from the beginning used the emotionalizing power of the internet for its own communication \u2014 much better than all other German parties together.\u201d",
      "That has helped it to perform strongly among young voters in recent regional elections. The party portrays itself as an anti-establishment force at a time of low trust in politicians, sometimes dismissing the \u201cold parties\u201d as a \u201ccartel.\u201d",
      "Schroeder described it as \u201csomething like an aircraft carrier for resentment and anger.\u201d Other parties say they won't work with it.",
      "AfD's rise has coincided with that of far-right parties in many other European countries, including Austria's Freedom Party and the National Rally in France, with which it has plenty of common ground. Weidel was in Budapest to visit Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n on Wednesday.",
      "However, it isn't part of those parties' Patriots for Europe group in the European Parliament after some tensions before last year's EU elections. AfD was thrown out of one of the group's predecessors after its leading candidate at the time, Maximilian Krah, said that not all Nazi SS men \u201cwere necessarily criminals.\u201d",
      "The party has found an enthusiastic supporter in billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Musk has declared that \u201conly the AfD can save Germany.\u201d He held a live chat on X with Weidel and appeared live by video link at an AfD campaign rally.",
      "At that rally, Weidel vowed to \u201cmake Germany great again\u201d in an echo of the U.S. president\u2019s slogan.",

    "summary": "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
    "story": [
      "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
      "BRUGES, Belgium -- St. Valentine chocolates always seek to show how deep your love is. This year, it might just also show how deep your pockets are.",
      "With the price of cocoa beans setting unprecedented records on the commodities market, it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. Turns out that if love is reputed to be eternal, a low price for cocoa, the essential ingredient in chocolate, is not.",
      "\u201cThe price increase of cocoa is absolutely spectacular, now for 2, 2\u00bd years,\u201d said Philippe de Sellier, the head of both Leonidas and Belgian chocolate federation Choprabisco. When it stood at less than $2,000 a ton in the summer of 2022, it really took over early last year and peaked at well over $12,000 during the Christmas season and has been hovering around the $10,000 mark since.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented prices. They haven't been this high for the last 50 years,\u201d said Bart Van Besien, policy adviser of the Oxfam fair trade group. And the impact can be felt deep in chocolate gourmet country Belgium, where some of its 280 chocolate companies are left with a bleeding heart during Valentine's week.",
      "Dominque Persoone, owner of the famed Chocolate Line brand, still has plenty of beans to grind in his workshop in Bruges, but considers himself lucky, partly because he also has his own cocoa plantation in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of colleagues who are really in trouble, because the price is too high,\" he said. \u201cIf you don't have good contacts, they just don't deliver anymore.\u201d",
      "Some just close for Valentine, he said, turning one of the few financial bonanzas of the year into a forced vacation, hoping that Easter, with its eggs and bunnies, will bring better tidings. Many chocolatiers can't go for the usual profit margins and turn all the extra costs of the cocoa prices over to their customers. Persoone said that his chocolates increased in price by 20% over the last year alone while de Selliers said that it depends very much from producer to producer.",
      "The shock of cocoa prices pretty much is a metaphorical perfect storm, mixing climate, disease, commodity speculation, the plight of farmers and social ascendency around the world into one heady mix.",
      "\u201cThe drop that has happened now in production was directly linked to climate change,\u201d said Van Besien, blaming changes in annual rain and drought patterns in western Africa that weakened the sensitive trees in key production areas. Persoone also said that the temperature differences between night and day increased in the small strip of land around the equator where the trees can thrive. Compounded by disease, it made sure too many harvests failed.",
      "At the same time across the world, populations lifted themselves out of poverty, middle classes expanded in places like China and the craving for the delicacy increased.",
      "And making matters worse, the years of slumping prices for the beans simply drove farmers off the land to look for a better future in the cities and pushed production further down. De Selliers said that \u201c60 % of cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana and these farmers have to make a better living. It is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Persoone concurred: \u201cWe didn't pay enough to have an honest price for the farmers.\u201d",
      "So, strangely enough, low prices then, help cause high prices now.",
      "\u201cThe big irony in the cocoa industry is that farmers are now getting a fair price at the moment they are abandoning cocoa farming,\u201d Van Besien said. \u201cWith the price they are getting right now, they could have invested in sustainable practices. They could have sent their children to school.\u201d",
      "Does it mean a premier box of chocolates is a guilty pleasure on Valentine's Day?",
      "\u201cYeah, the guilt question .... It's one that always works,\u201d said Van Besien, the fair trade expert. \u201cWe could not survive if we would be thinking about these things all the time,\u201d arguing that legislation should trump consumer emotions.",
      "\u201cWe should have laws that make buying cocoa below the cost of the production something illegal. And it should not be up to the consumer to make this decision,\u201d he said. Both de Selliers and Persoone hope that if the prices drop down again, they stay around the $5,000 or $6,000 mark.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope the money goes to the farmers,\u201d Persoone said.",
      "So in the meantime, despite the price hikes, the chocolate shouldn't leave too bitter a taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small luxury that most people still can afford,\u201d Persoone said. \"I hope it stays like this.\u201d",

      "Landlords in Hong Kong, a city with a notoriously high cost of housing, have found they can make more money by dividing a flat into two or more units",
      "HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of people in densely populated, land-poor Hong Kong live in tiny dwellings made by dividing up apartments, most smaller than a parking space. It's an affordable option for students and low-income families but can also mean banging shins in cramped and in some cases substandard living spaces.",
      "The city's government has proposed new rules that would set minimum standards for such housing units, but residents and advocates for the poor worry that it could drive up rents and make it even harder to hang on in the city. The city's eventual goal, mandated by Beijing, is to eliminate subdivided apartments over the next 25 years.",
      "Officials are aiming to pass the rules into law within the year. After that, landlords will have a grace period to make their substandard flats meet the bar. The government has promised to assist affected residents in resettlement and adopt a gradual approach in its policy implementation to avoid causing panic.",
      "Here are some of the numbers that illustrate the residents' living conditions and the proposed policy.",
      "Hong Kong's population in mid-2024",
      "How much land is used for housing in the densely-packed territory, according to the city's planning department",
      "The number of dwellings created by dividing apartments",
      "The number of people who live in them",
      "The median size of the units that have been carved out. About one-fourth are less than eight square meters (86 square feet), the minimum size mandated under the proposed rules",
      "The standard size of a parking space in Hong Kong",
      "Or 5,000 Hong Kong dollars: the median rent for a unit in a subdivided apartment",
      "Estimated number of units that would need major renovations under the proposed rules",
      "The year by which China's central government wants Hong Kong to phase out subdivided units. It will mark 100 years of communist rule in China.",

      "In a major reversal, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency says he'll try to rescind $20 billion in grants awarded by the Biden administration for climate and clean-energy projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a major reversal, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency said he will try to rescind $20 billion in grants awarded by the Biden administration for climate and clean-energy projects.",
      "In a video posted on X, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for a still-emerging \u201cgreen bank\u201d that is set to fund tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice.",
      "The program, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but is more commonly called the green bank. Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.",
      "The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently cited it as one of his major accomplishments.",
      "Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"",
      "The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.",
      "Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.",
      "\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d",
      "The money has already been awarded to eight nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organizations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris announced the grant awards last year at an event in Charlotte, North Carolina."

      "It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem.",
      "Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Caf\u00e9 celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.",
      "Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy\u2019s reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.",
      "In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter more than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.",
      "The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.",
      "Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs.",
      "Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.",
      "The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.",
      "Changing preferences since then have caused further market strain. Americans are increasingly looking for protein with few added ingredients, and eggs fit that bill.",
      "\u201cConsumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you\u2019re making something with eggs, you know it\u2019s fresh,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "To address animal rights concerns, McDonald\u2019s and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.",
      "\u201cIt makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.",
      "Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.",
      "First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them.",
      "First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.",
      "Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.",
      "\u201cEggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,\u201d Richardson said.",

      "English cricket has generated more than 520 million pounds ($650 million) from the sale of stakes in franchises in its recently created competition The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States",
      "English cricket has generated around $650 million from the sale of stakes in franchises in The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States, including consortiums involving NFL great Tom Brady and Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.",
      "Auctions held over the past two weeks drew bids that value the eight teams in The Hundred \u2014 a format similar to Twenty20 and launched in England only in 2021 \u2014 at more than $1.2 billion.",
      "English cricket officials confirmed the huge figures for the first time on Thursday and set out how they want the money spent. The priority? Safeguarding the future of the domestic game that has lurched into financial strife in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a seminal moment for cricket in England and Wales,\u201d said Richard Thompson, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board.",
      "The investors who secured stakes in the franchises range from Silicon Valley tech giants including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, to four Indian conglomerates already owning teams in the widely popular Indian Premier League.",
      "Throw in the likes of Knighthead Capital Management, which includes Brady and already owns Birmingham City soccer club, and Cain International, a company co-funded by Boehly, and there's now a heavy dose of expertise in finance, technology and elite sport in a once-quaint sport that has been supercharged by money from around the world.",
      "It was 17 years ago when Allen Stanford, a Texan businessman, flew into Lord's \u2014 the so-called \u201chome of cricket\u201d in northwest London \u2014 aboard a private helicopter filled with fake dollar notes in a publicity stunt for a remarkable deal he reached with the ECB: A five-match T20 series between England and superstars from the Caribbean worth $100 million.",
      "The ECB were in raptures for a supposedly game-changing deal that quickly went wrong when Stanford was charged with \u2014 and later convicted of \u2014 fraud.",
      "So, has the ECB learnt its lessons after hitting the jackpot again?",
      "\u201cThis has probably been done in a different style \u2014 a bit more muted,\u201d ECB chief executive Richard Gould said on a video call. \u201cWe are very confident in the investor group we have got. ... We haven't been complacent.\u201d",
      "The ECB has done \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d and \u201call the checks to ensure it will be a different outcome\" to the Stanford debacle, director of business operations Vikram Banerjee said.",
      "The ECB seems open to that, yes.",
      "\u201cWe'd be foolish not to listen to the amazing set of investors that have got great ideas,\u201d Gould said. \u201cWe need to make sure we are a governing body that provides stability but also enables our investors and county clubs to drive forward.\u201d",
      "Gould made reference to the NFL taking games overseas and also the idea \u2014 floated around in 2008 but never adopted \u2014 of a 39th round of English Premier League games played abroad.",
      "No, the ECB insists.",
      "The governing body said it still owns The Hundred as a competition and felt it was important the \u201cstructure of the game is retained and owned by the ECB and our members (the counties).\u201d That means the schedule, the formats and the governance of English cricket.",
      "Expect, however, the new investors to make changes to their franchises when it comes to team names, colors and branding in The Hundred from 2026.",
      "Changing the times when matches are played \u2014 to potentially suit Indian audiences, for example \u2014 is \u201cnot on the agenda,\u201d Gould said, because securing strong attendances inside the stadiums is a priority.",
      "Banerjee said there was no intention to turn the Hundred \u2014 a format where each team receives a maximum of 100 balls \u2014 into a T20 competition but could envisage the competition having a second tier if there is enough growth.",
      "The ECB said the new investors have a \u201clock-in period\u201d of five years before they can sell their shares to other parties.",
      "The ECB said the deals, once finalized after an exclusivity period, will underpin \u201clong-term financial sustainability\u201d in the domestic game in England.",
      "Proceeds from the sales will be split 19 ways \u2014 between the 18 long-established county teams in the English and Welsh domestic game as well as the Marylebone Cricket Club, which owns Lord\u2019s and is regarded as the guardian of the laws of the game. The grassroots game is in line to receive around 50 million pounds ($62 million), the ECB said.",
      "\u201cOur three overarching principles as we look at what we want this investment to deliver should be strategic, ambitious and leaving a legacy,\u201d Thompson said in an open letter. \u201cWe may not get this chance again for at least a generation, and cannot afford to waste this golden opportunity.\u201d",
      "Thompson spoke of the money heading to \u201cthree core investment areas\u201d: Building reserves, revenue generation or debt reduction.",

      "\u201cTODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d",
      "The prospect of a dramatic hike on tariffs could send shockwaves through the world economy, possibly depressing growth while also causing inflation to intensify. Trump has maintained that such tariffs will help to create domestic factory jobs, but most economists say they would effectively be a tax increase on U.S. consumers that would add to inflationary pressures.",
      "The Republican president has openly antagonized multiple U.S. trading partners over the past several weeks, levying tariff threats and inviting them to retaliate with import taxes of their own that could send the economy hurtling into a trade war.",
      "Trump has put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports due that country's role in the production of the opioid fentanyl. He also has readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. On top of that, on Monday, he removed the exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. And he's mused about new tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The European Union, Canada and Mexico have countermeasures ready to inflict economic pain on the United States in response to Trump's actions, while China has already taken retaliatory steps with its own tariffs on U.S. energy, agricultural machinery and large-engine autos as well as an antitrust investigation of Google.",
      "Trump has not specified how he defines the term \u201creciprocal\u201d and whether his order would apply only to matching tariffs or to including other foreign taxes that he views as a barrier to exporting American goods.",
      "The White House has argued that charging the same import taxes as other countries do would improve the fairness of trade, potentially raising revenues for the U.S. government while also enabling negotiations that could eventually improve trade.",
      "But Trump is also making a political wager that voters can tolerate higher inflation levels. Price spikes in 2021 and 2022 severely weakened the popularity of then-President Joe Biden, with voters so frustrated by inflation eroding their buying power that they chose last year to put Trump back in the White House to address the problem. Inflation has risen since November's election, with the government reporting on Wednesday that the consumer price index is running at an annual rate of 3%.",
      "The Trump team has decried criticism of its tariffs even as it has acknowledged the likelihood of some financial pain. It says that the tariffs have to be weighed against the possible extension and expansion of Trump's 2017 tax cuts as well as efforts to curb regulations and force savings through the spending freezes and staff reductions in billionaire adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "But an obstacle for this approach might be the sequencing of the various policies and the possibilities of a wider trade conflict stifling investment and hiring amid the greater inflationary pressures.",
      "Analysts at the bank Wells Fargo said in a Thursday report that the tariffs would likely hurt growth this year, just as the extended tax cuts could help growth recover in 2026.",
      "\u201cTariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,\" the report said. \u201cThe U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.\u201d"

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. eased for the fourth week in a row, an encouraging sign for prospective home shoppers as the spring homebuying season gets underway.",
      "The average rate fell to 6.87% from 6.89% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, it averaged 6.77%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, rose this week. The average rate increased to 6.09% from 6.05% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.12%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including how the bond market reacts to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has been mostly hovering around 7% this year. That\u2019s more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years, extending a national home sales slump that began in 2022 as mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows.",

      "Thailand's army says some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar",
      "BANGKOK -- Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand's army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, first is to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",
      "Underlining Beijing\u2019s concern, Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Public Security and Commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar\u2019s scam centers are located.",
      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",
      "Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand\u2019s northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed illegally in the areas."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:18:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected",
      "WASHINGTON -- As a candidate last year, Donald Trump suggested he could easily conquer inflation and ease voters' fears about the economy.",
      "\u201cI will very quickly deflate,\u201d he promised at a California rally. \u201cWe are going to take inflation, and we are going to deflate it. We are going to deflate inflation. We are going to defeat inflation. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of inflation.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's consumer price index report showed that inflation is punching back \u2014 and President Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden.",
      "The annual inflation rate has risen in the three months since the November election to 3%, with gasoline prices climbing despite Trump's claims that his return to the White House would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs.",
      "Trump frequently makes far-reaching assertions about his power to bring about change only to find that it is no match for market forces. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",
      "Consumer sentiment measures suggest the public already sees Trump\u2019s plans to expand tariffs as increasing inflation. On Wednesday, the president called for interest rate cuts, even though rate hikes by the Federal Reserve helped lower inflation that spiked at a four-decade high in 2022.",
      "The latest consumer price figures have unnerved economists and the financial markets because they suggest that strong consumer spending, solid job gains and a falling unemployment rate could reignite inflation. Steady demand, particularly from wealthier consumers, makes it easier for companies to keep raising prices.",
      "The cost of goods \u2014 including toys and auto parts \u2014 rose last month even before the imposition of tariffs. Trump has placed 10% tariffs on China, in addition to announcing the removal of exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. There are also potential tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico and a potential executive order that would increase tariffs to match the import taxes charged by other countries.",
      "All of this means that baseline inflationary pressures could be at their highest level in decades.",
      "\u201cDisinflation may be dead, and we may be looking at a higher rate of inflation than we observed for the 20 years prior to the pandemic,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax and advisory firm.",
      "Trump's call for lower rates puts him in opposition to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.",
      "\u201cIf inflation goes up in general, we will use our tools, which is the interest rate, to bring it back down to 2% over time,\" Powell told a congressional committee on Wednesday. Powell also said that Trump's calls to lower rates wouldn't sway the Fed.",
      "So far, the Trump White House's main response to this challenge has been to blame Biden, an argument with a short lifespan as Trump is exerting more control over economic policy.",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration indeed left us with a mess to deal with,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Wednesday's news briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s far worse than I think anybody anticipated.\u201d",
      "But Trump allies are also starting to float new ideas for tackling inflation. Standing in the Oval Office on Tuesday, billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the president's Department of Government Efficiency, proposed $1 trillion in spending cuts this year.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, wants to eliminate $1 out of every $7 spent by the federal government in order to bring the inflation rate to zero. It's not clear based on lawsuits and Congress' responsibility for government funding that Musk can deliver those savings.",
      "\u201cIf you cut the budget deficit by a trillion between now and next year, there is no inflation,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd if the government is not borrowing as much, it means that interest costs decline. So everyone\u2019s mortgage, their car payment, their credit card bills, anything, their student debt, the monthly payments drop. That\u2019s a fantastic scenario for the average American.\u201d",
      "Such a steep cut might bring lower prices but also the pain of a sharp economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThat would be a roughly 4% of GDP cut to federal spending, all in one year,\u201d said Michael Linden, a senior policy fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt would be an instant recession.\u201d",
      "For now, markets are anticipating more inflation as consumer demand stays strong and Trump has yet to show how exactly his policies would keep prices low, as he promised to voters.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped Wednesday to 4.62% in response to the inflation report, a sign that investors expect interest rates, growth and inflation to be higher in the coming months.",
      "Consumers also say that inflation will rise. Americans' expectations of inflation over the next year have soared, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. The February survey said that inflation this year will be 4.3%, up sharply from 3.3% the previous month. Many respondents mentioned tariffs as a concern.",
      "When asked Wednesday why Trump\u2019s call for lower interest rates would temper inflation, Leavitt focused on what the president \u201cwants\u201d instead of what he would do.",
      "\u201cHe wants interest rates to be lower,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants inflation to be lower. And he believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.\u201d"

    "summary": "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
    "story": [
      "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Back when egg prices remained securely under $2 a dozen in 2021, Nevada joined several other states concerned about animal welfare in requiring cage-free eggs.",
      "Now four years later, a dozen eggs costs an average of nearly $5 in the U.S. because of the lingering bird flu, so Nevada passed a law the governor signed Thursday that will allow the state to suspend that law temporarily in hopes of getting residents some relief at the checkout counter.",
      "But it is not quite that simple, which is why the other six states with the same laws are so far reticent to follow suit.",
      "By relaxing the rule, Nevada might get access to additional eggs, but the supply of all eggs remains tight because nearly 159 million birds have been slaughtered since the bird flu outbreak began in 2022 to help limit virus spread. The virus prompts the slaughter of entire flocks anytime it is found.",
      "It is not clear dropping cage-free laws will have a significant effect on egg prices that have peaked at an average of $4.95 per dozen because the farmers who collectively invested several billion dollars in making the switch can\u2019t easily go back to raising chickens packed together in massive barns that they already spent the money to convert.",
      "Even if all the cage-free laws went away, big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Sodexo remain committed to buying only those kind of eggs, ensuring strong demand for cage-free eggs.",
      "University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said opening up Nevada to all kinds of eggs \u201ccould ease egg prices in Nevada very slightly,\u201d but that it might make prices worse elsewhere because supplies are so tight.",
      "But Nevada is going to give it a try even if California, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan don't seem to be considering it. Arizona, Rhode Island and Utah also have cage-free laws on the books, but theirs won't take effect for at least a couple more years.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts III, who raises chickens in his Nevada backyard, advocated for the 2021 bill to promote the \u201cstandard of humane treatment\u201d of the animals. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has caused egg prices to to hit a record high, and cage-free eggs are generally even more expensive.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was not foreseen at that time was this major animal disease outbreak,\u201d Watts testified Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, there was no regulatory flexibility to suspend those requirements in the event of a major supply chain disruption.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the legislation Thursday. Nevada Department of Agriculture Director J.J. Goicoechea is expected to authorize the 120-day suspension of the cage-free egg requirements within a day, according to Goicoechea's spokesperson Ciara Ressel.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate 30 days before we can see an impact at the grocery stores,\u201d Ressel said.",
      "This month\u2019s jump in egg prices was the biggest since the nation\u2019s last bird flu outbreak in 2015. The previous high was set two years ago when eggs were selling for $4.82 per dozen on average.",
      "The average prices mask just how bad it is in some places. Some Californians these days are shelling out $12.99 for a dozen, or more than a buck an egg. Some New York shops even started selling bundles of three eggs to help people who can't afford a full dozen.",
      "Nevada resident Nancy Wong said she has been \u201coutraged\u201d by egg prices in the state. \u201cWe have gone to the store and eggs have been either rationed or completely out,\u201d she said.",
      "The concern with the cage-free requirements is that only about 121 million of the 304 million chickens laying eggs nationwide are raised on cage-free farms, so the supply is limited.",
      "Many of the eggs those hens produce are promised to restaurant chains like McDonald's and Panera, food service giants like Sodexo and Aramark and grocers under long-term contracts that help keep prices down. But even when they do have to pay a premium, grocers sometimes lose money on eggs by selling them cheaply to try to get shoppers in the door.",
      "The number of cage-free chickens has steadily increased in recent years because of the laws and the pressure from the companies buying eggs, increasing exponentially from just 38 million at the start of 2017. But the United Egg Producers trade group has estimated it would take at least 226 million cage-free hens to meet all the demand for those eggs, and more customers are clamoring for them, so the supply is tight.",
      "The total flock of chickens nationwide used to number above 330 million before the bird flu outbreak began.",
      "Even as more egg farmers were converting to cage-free setups over the past decade, prices stayed between $1.40 and $2 per dozen most of the time with only the normal seasonal price spikes around Easter and Thanksgiving until this current bird flu outbreak began in early 2022.",
      "If bird flu outbreaks happen to hit cage-free farms hard, there are fewer eggs out there that can replace the lost ones. For example, out of the nearly 47 million birds slaughtered just since the start of December, more than 3 million of them were on five cage-free farms in California.",
      "Anytime birds must be killed, it takes months for a farm to resume producing eggs because of the time required to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the barns and raise new chickens until they are about 5 months old and capable of laying eggs.",
      "California won\u2019t consider dropping its cage-free law in part because the rule came from a measure voters passed in 2018, so voters would have to approve any major changes.",
      "But there doesn't seem to be much support for changes in other states either.",
      "Michigan state Rep. Jerry Neyer, a dairy farmer and chair of the state House Agriculture Committee, said the idea that new cage-free laws are driving up egg prices is a \u201cmisconception.\u201d The Republican added that most farms already adapted to comply with the law, so dropping the mandate wouldn't cut costs.",
      "A bill to repeal Colorado\u2019s cage-free requirements, which just took effect on Jan. 1, was killed in its first committee vote last month. The sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Gonzalez, argued that while the avian flu was a major factor in prices, the cage-free rules played a significant role. But the majority of lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical.",
      "Jonathan Kuester, who runs the small Historic Wagner Farm with about 200 Red Star hens in Illinois just outside Chicago, said he doesn't think cage-free practices are the cause of the egg shortages.",
      "He acknowledged his farm is more vulnerable to a bird flu infection than a traditional farm where chickens are confined inside a barn that can be better protected. Kuester's birds roam free, where they might interact with ducks and geese that are the main carriers of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe egg shortage that people are seeing is a result of some fairly large flocks being euthanized, and so fewer chickens are currently laying than were three or four months ago,\" Kuester said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a panic, too. People are suddenly buying eggs as quickly as they can, and so you see that shortage.\"",

      "It said the attack that began last week targeted a dhow, a traditional ship that plies the waters of the Mideast, off the town of Eyl in Somalia.",
      "\u201cThe immediate presence of Atalanta forces in the area, especially the helicopter, was decisive in the fishing vessel liberation,\u201d EUNAVFOR said. \u201cThe crew confirmed that the alleged pirates abandoned the vessel after stealing personal objects and two skiffs belonging to the dhow.\u201d",
      "Piracy off the Somali coast peaked in 2011 when 237 attacks were reported. Somali piracy in the region at the time cost the world\u2019s economy some $7 billion \u2014 with $160 million paid out in ransoms, according to the Oceans Beyond Piracy monitoring group.",
      "The threat was diminished by increased international naval patrols, a strengthening central government in Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital, and other efforts.",
      "However, Somali pirate attacks have resumed at a greater pace over the last year, in part due to the insecurity caused by Yemen's Houthi rebels launching their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "Since President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on bringing about a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce at a breakneck pace",
      "Since President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on dramatically reducing the federal workforce at a breakneck pace.",
      "From dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development to offering a mass deferred resignation plan, Trump's Republican administration has released executive orders and memos aimed at substantially reshaping the size of government and where its employees work.",
      "Here's what to know about the federal workforce, its job protections and the process of cutting back on its ranks.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, comprises about 2.4 million people.",
      "While a chunk of federal workers, about 20%, are in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% are distributed outside the region.",
      "Civil servants are the vast majority of federal workers. They're generally hired through an application process and have strong protections once in their positions.",
      "Political appointees, who number roughly 4,000, serve at the discretion of the president and can be dismissed at will by the chief executive.",
      "\u201cCivil servants tend to be in their jobs as careers, some of them for decades,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government.",
      "It\u2019s not easy to fire the vast majority of federal workers \u2014 they have considerable job security with a long legal history.",
      "Federal employees who are not political appointees have strong protections designed to prevent political whims from clearing out the workforce. The protections have grown over time, under leadership of both major political parties.",
      "\u201cThe president definitely has his work cut out for him,\u201d said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.",
      "Federal workers are entitled to due process, which means they can challenge disciplinary actions through a formal process. They have to be notified of the allegations against them and allowed to respond and present their side.",
      "\u201cYou have to build a record to fire somebody, and that doesn't often happen,\u201d Kamarck said.",
      "Federal employee protections started as a reform to the chaos caused by the 19th-century spoils system, in which federal jobs were awarded to a president's loyalists. It led to incompetence and corruption as well as massive turnover with new administrations that proved disruptive and prevented continuity of expertise.",
      "In 1881, President James Garfield was shot and killed by a man who believed Garfield owed him a job after campaigning for him. That led to the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, which created a merit-based system for hiring federal employees.",
      "In 1978, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act, to shield the merit system with enforceable rights so that most federal workers can be fired only for a legitimate reason.",
      "\u201cThe idea is that we\u2019re not going to get the best people if their jobs are completely insecure and if they\u2019re going to lose their job every time a new party takes power, so to encourage quality people to apply for government service, we provide some security,\u201d said David Super, a professor who specializes in administrative law at Georgetown Law.",
      "No other U.S. leader has attempted sweeping and dramatic cuts like those Trump wants, said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization focused on improving government.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in our history that has ever approximated what we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Stier said.",
      "Federal workers have union representation, but, unlike those of many industries, they do not have the power to strike. Federal workers also can't bargain over pay, because salaries are set in law.",
      "Federal unions can bargain over working conditions and basic protections for their members. Recently, unions have battled over remote working conditions, which they've successfully bargained for in the past and Trump is working to sharply reduce.",
      "\u201cThere also are some limits about what they can bargain over, so, for example, they can\u2019t bargain over what the policy of their agency is,\" Super said. \"That\u2019s a matter for the political process to work out, but they can bargain for things that affect workers on their jobs and their well-being.\u201d",
      "Federal employees have varying probationary periods, often a year or two, when they carry out tasks under a supervisor, who evaluates whether the worker is doing the job successfully. If not, workers can be dismissed; if so, they are brought on as full-time employees with protections.",
      "Employees on probation don\u2019t have the same appeal rights \u2014 it\u2019s an easier process to dismiss them.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The State Department had been in talks with Elon Musk's Tesla company to buy armored electric vehicles, but the plans have been put on hold by the Trump administration after reports emerged about a potential $400 million purchase.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said the electric car company owned by Musk, who has become President Donald Trump's billionaire adviser aiming to dismantle agencies and downsize the federal workforce, was the only one that expressed interest back in May 2024, when Joe Biden was president.",
      "While it was in its planning phases, the deal with Tesla was forecast to be the largest contract of the year. It shows how some of his wealth has come and was still expected to come from taxpayers before the plans were put on hold. His companies obtain hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. And Tesla had already received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "No government contract had been given to Tesla or any other manufacturer to produce armored electric vehicles for the Department of State, the agency said.",
      "The Biden administration had tasked the State Department to gather information from potential suppliers to buy these vehicles in September. An official request for bids was to be released in May, according to State Department data from December. But that solicitation is now on hold with no plans to issue it, the State Department said.",
      "After reports emerged about the plans to buy from Tesla, the State Department changed the data entry on its expected contracts forecast for fiscal year 2025 late Wednesday. The State Department said it should have been entered into the system as a generic \u201celectric vehicle manufacturer,\" but there is at least another entry for a different purchase that continues to list a company\u2014 German car manufacturer BMW."

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The future of Indonesia\u2019s automobiles and motorbikes is electric \u2014 at least according to exhibitors at the Indonesia International Motor Show, which opened in the country's capital city of Jakarta on Thursday.",
      "That's despite the country's own slow uptake of electric vehicles and motorbikes, which only make up a small fraction of the vehicles in the world's fourth most populated country.",
      "Over 50 international and domestic brands were on display at the massive exhibition hall, with several brands staging Indonesian debuts for hybrid or electric vehicles. Chinese automaker BYD unveiled its Sealion 7 electric SUV, while Vietnamese automaker VinFast's electric-powered VF 3 mini SUV had its Indonesia debut.",
      "The event also welcomed a new automaker to Indonesia, with China's Honri bringing its five-passenger Boma EV.",
      "While the show floor was dominated by Asian companies, other international makers were present as well, including Germany's Volkswagen and BMW's Mini.",
      "Motorbikes \u2014 of which Indonesia has one of the largest fleets in the world, with over 132 million registered in 2023 \u2014 were also a mainstay of event, with foreign-made Royal Enfields and Vespas on display alongside Indonesia-made Alvas.",
      "A much smaller part of the show featured fossil fuel-powered jet skis and boats, which can be seen on the vast coastlines, rivers and lakes of the country's over 17,000 islands.",
      "Outside the exhibition hall, drivers enjoyed new-car smell as they test drove cars across parking lots and over steep ramps. Eager leasing agents and sales representatives awaited drivers as they stepped out from behind the wheel.",
      "The show opened as the country faced a slowdown in it's automative industry last year: In 2024 sales fell by nearly 14% \u2014 from 1 million units in 2023 to 866,000 in 2024 according to the Indonesian Automotive Manufacturers Association. Indonesia\u2019s number of registered vehicles was reported at 24,646,825 units in 2023, according to the association.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, said the event is expected to be one of the main drivers in the recovery of the country\u2019s slowing automotive sector.",
      "\u201cIn a declining market condition, all stakeholders, including the government, need to find strategic steps to increase public interest in shopping for motor vehicles,\u201d he said during the event\u2019s opening.",
      "While sales of electric vehicles and motorbikes are rising, they're still just 7% of the country\u2019s fleet, according to consulting firm PwC.",
      "A lack of infrastructure, high upfront cost and low performance hinder the adoption of EVs in Indonesia, according to a 2023 report by Indonesia-based nongovernmental organization Institute for Essential Services Reform.",
      "Some EV makers said they recognize these barriers and are working to tackle them.",
      "VinFast is partnering with V-Green, a spin-off from VinFast's charging station development division, to build 30,000 chargers across Indonesia, said VinFast Asia CEO Pham Sanh Chau.",
      "\u201cWithout (chargers), we cannot sell the car,\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we come in with the whole ecosystem.\"",
      "VinFast and other electric vehicle makers such as BYD are also building EV manufacturing plants in Indonesia. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai and China\u2019s Wuling have both had EV plants in the country since 2022.",
      "The Indonesia government has sought partnerships with makers as it is eager to turn the country into an international hub for EVs, leveraging its abundant reserves of critical materials needed to make batteries.",
      "The small percentage of sales matches the slow progress of Indonesia\u2019s energy transition: Despite receiving billions of dollars in funding to retire coal and transition to greener energy, the country's renewable energy mix was \u200b\u200bjust 14% in 2024, with a majority of energy coming from highly-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale prices came in hotter than expected last month at a time when progress against inflation appears to have stalled, undercutting expectations for lower interest rates this year.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers \u2014 rose 0.4% from December and 3.5% from January 2024. Forecasters had expected a 0.2% change month over month and 3.2% year over year.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices rose 0.3% last month from December and 3.6% from a year earlier.",
      "Wholesale services prices rose 0.3%, pushed higher by increasing hotel costs. Goods services climbed 0.6% on higher energy prices.",
      "The wholesale price report arrived a day after the Labor Department delivered some bad news about inflation at the consumer level. Its consumer price index rose 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 2.9% year-over-year increase in December.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation flared up in early 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, overwhelming factories, ports and freight yards and leading to shortages, delays and higher prices.",
      "In response, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate \u2014 the fed funds rate \u2014 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation began tumbling \u2014 from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022 to a low of 2.4% in September, tantalizingly close to the central bank's 2% target. The Fed was satisfied enough to reverse course and cut its rate three times in the last four months of 2024.",
      "Then the improvement on inflation stopped. Year-over-year consumer price inflation has now risen for four straight months.",
      "And economists and financial markets are worried that President Donald Trump's policies will push inflation higher yet. His tariffs on foreign goods and plans to deport millions of undocumented workers could translate into higher prices.",
      "In response to stubborn inflation, the Fed may hold off on further rate cuts. Back in December, it signaled that it expected to cut two more times in 2025. That seems far less likely now. Wall Street investors anticipate only rate cut this year and don't expect that one until October.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong plans to crack down on poor-quality subdivided flats are leaving many low-income residents uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets",
      "HONG KONG -- Jimmy Au\u2019s world shrinks to about the size of a parking space whenever she gets home.",
      "Her cramped Hong Kong home is one of four units carved out of what was once a single apartment. Most of the space is occupied by the bunk bed she shares with her husband and son, and their sleep is often disrupted by neighbors returning late or heading out early. Au\u2019s son often gets bruises bumping into things. Privacy is limited, with only a curtain separating the bathroom from the kitchen.",
      "But what troubles Au most about her home is that she might lose it. Hong Kong's government is planning to crack down on what it calls inadequate housing in subdivided apartments, mandating a minimum size and other baseline standards for homes like Au's. A public consultation period ended on Monday, and the government is aiming to pass the rules into law this year.",
      "The proposed rules leave many low-income residents like Au uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets.",
      "Au, a homemaker who moved from mainland China nine years ago, said her family pays about $460 a month in rent, about half of the income her husband makes from irregular renovation jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid the rent will get so high we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Au said, sitting on the bed's lower bunk, surrounded by clothes, a fan and plastic storage drawers.",
      "Housing is a sensitive issue in Hong Kong, one of the world's least affordable cities. Some 7.5 million people live in a small territory that's mostly made up of steep slopes. Just 7%, or 80 square kilometers (30 square miles), of the city's total land is residential. The average price of an apartment of less than 40 square meters (430 square feet) last December ranged from about $13,800 to $16,800 per square meter, depending on the district.",
      "Beijing, which sees the city\u2019s housing problems as a driver of the 2019 anti-government protests, wants the city to phase out subdivided units by 2049. The government is also boosting the public housing supply, aiming to provide 189,000 flats over the next five years.",
      "But some 220,000 people rely on subdivided units, including migrants, workers, students and young professionals.",
      "Most subdivided homes are not far from the standards, the government said, but an estimated 33,000 units would need major renovations to meet them.",
      "The proposed rules would mandate a minimum size of at least eight square meters (86 square feet), a bar the government says it meant to leave room for low-priced housing. Every unit will also need to have a window, a toilet exclusively for the occupants' use, and a door to separate the toilet from other parts of the home, among other criteria.",
      "Landlords will have a grace period to renovate. After that, violations could lead to up to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of about $38,500.",
      "Security guard Fafa Ching has lived in multiple subdivided flats for over a decade. Her current unit costs about $490 per month and lacks even a bathroom sink, forcing her to collect water from the showerhead with a basin to wash her face. Her home will need renovation to meet proposed requirements for fire safety and separate electricity and water meters.",
      "Ching worries that upgraded homes will be too expensive for her.",
      "The government has said if necessary, it will offer assistance such as helping affected tenants to find other private accommodation or directly providing temporary shelter. A top official told the city\u2019s public broadcaster that transitional housing apartments are ready and assured that large-scale enforcement will happen only when proper resettlement arrangements are available.",
      "Chan Siu-ming, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong\u2019s social and behavioral sciences department, welcomed the government\u2019s taking steps to set minimum standards, but said its resettlement plans are inadequate.",
      "Chan said the impact could be wider than officials expect, and the city\u2019s supply of public and transitional housing may not meet needs. Low-income residents may also need help shouldering the cost of moving house, he said.",
      "As of last September, the average waiting time for a public flat is five and a half years, but it can take even longer than that. Ching said she's waited for eight years.",
      "In an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press, the government said it does not expect significant surges in rent as demand will drop with the increasing public housing supply. It reiterated that the rules will be implemented gradually to avoid causing panic.",
      "Chan added that some single people may be forced into even smaller dormitory-like \u201cbed spaces,\u201d which are not covered by the proposed rules. Bed spaces are widely considered to be Hong Kong's worst form of housing \u2014 partitioned areas in which residents get barely enough space to fit a single bed and some belongings. They are currently regulated under another law, the government said.",
      "Sze Lai-shan, the deputy director of the Society for Community Organization, a non-government organization, said some people have already been asked to move out of subdivided homes as landlords anticipate the policy.",
      "She suggested the government start registering substandard flats before the legislation comes into force to assess the residents\u2019 needs and consider expanding the eligibility for transitional housing. She also hoped the policy would eventually cover those living in tiny bed spaces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain to people that Hong Kong has two sets of housing standards,\u201d she said.",
      "In Sham Shui Po, one of the city\u2019s poorest districts, bed space resident Law Chung Yu said he doubts that landlords will be able to comply with the rules.",
      "Law, who can\u2019t work due to a health problem and rents one layer of a bunk bed, pays around $280 in monthly rent for the bed space, about 30% of what he gets from the government subsidies he lives on. He shares a bathroom with neighbors in an apartment infested by lice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically an armchair strategy, I don\u2019t see it having much impact in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Au's never measured her unit, and isn\u2019t sure if her unit meets the minimum size. But with her neighboring units falling short of the minimum size requirement, she knows her home would probably be gone too. She hopes the government will help resettle affected households into places that cost the same as their current rent.",
      "Her landlord hasn\u2019t discussed the issue with her yet. For now, all she can do is wait.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking it day by day. It\u2019d be worse if I think about it so much I develop mental problems,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cWe really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\u201d Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \u201cTech Support.\u201d He also joked that he was the \u201cWhite House\u2019s tech support,\u201d borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",
      "\u201cI think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t remove the roots of the weed, then it\u2019s easy for the weed to grow back.\u201d",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance on Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Trump\u2019s blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That\u2019s included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role imbued his comments with more weight beyond being the world\u2019s wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\u201cA lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\u201d Musk said, referring to Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThere's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?\u2019\u201d",
      "He added that the U.S. under Trump is \u201cless interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\u201d",
      "There are \u201ctimes the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\u201d Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\u201d he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\u201cIf hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there\u2019s too many men in power and execute them,\u201d Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \u201ckind of scary.\u201d",
      "He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\u201d A court filing Wednesday on Musk's behalf in the OpenAI dispute said he'd withdraw his bid if the ChatGPT maker drops its plan to convert into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \u201cDubai Loop\u201d project in line with his work in the Boring Company \u2014 which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit.",
      "A later statement from Dubai's crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, said the city-state and the Boring Company \u201cwill explore the development\u201d of a 17-kilometer (10.5-mile) underground network with 11 stations that could transport over 20,000 passengers an hour. He offered no financial terms for the deal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\u201d",

      "During a time of pressure on public broadcasters, PBS says that it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and firing the two executives who staffed it",
      "NEW YORK -- PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order, firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio girds for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than it has faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \u201cwe were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\u201d",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it is filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \u201cWe're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\u201d Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \u201csystemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\u201d",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee posted \u201clet's defund PBS and NPR\u201d on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\u201cI think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\u201d",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \u201cthere is bias at play\u201d when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \u201cWe take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\u201d she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\u201cI'm always an optimistic person,\u201d Kerger said, \u201cbut I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine's government.",
      "Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn't expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it's costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren't favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.",
      "Washington's 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump's new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.",
      "However, a third of members still haven't reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn't commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.",

      "The New York Jets announced they told quarterback Aaron Rodgers they are moving on without him next season",
      "The New York Jets announced Thursday they told quarterback Aaron Rodgers they are moving on without him next season.",
      "While Rodgers hasn\u2019t said whether he intends to continue playing for a 21st NFL season, the Jets \u2014 with new general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn in charge \u2014 have officially ruled out a return to New York.",
      "In a joint statement issued by the team, Mougey and Glenn said they met with the 41-year-old quarterback last week and informed him of their plans.",
      "\u201cIt was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures,\" Mougey and Glenn said in the statement. \"We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward.\u201d",
      "The four-time MVP, who\u2019s the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets.",
      "New York would absorb a $49 million dead money charge next season unless it designates Rodgers a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years.",
      "In April 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets after 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers \u2014 looking to help the franchise end a Super Bowl drought which dates to the glory days of Joe Namath and the 1968 season.",
      "Rodgers\u2019 first season in New York ended just four snaps into his debut because of a torn left Achilles tendon that sank the Jets\u2019 Super Bowl hopes that were stirred by the QB\u2019s arrival.",
      "He worked his way back to the field to start every game this past season, but he and the offense struggled with consistency and results and the Jets finished 5-12.",
      "\u201cI personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets,\u201d owner Woody Johnson in a statement. \u201cHis arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From Day 1, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here.",
      "\"He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next.\u201d",
      "Rodgers\u2019 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing both rank third for a single season in franchise history. But he lacked some mobility early in his return and then dealt with a few additional leg injuries, including a significant hamstring ailment.",
      "The Jets\u2019 offense with Rodgers struggled to produce, the defense was a shell of its formerly dominant self and it cost both general manager Joe Douglas and coach Robert Saleh their jobs in the middle of the season.",
      "In what turned out to be his final appearance with New York, Rodgers threw a season-high four touchdown passes in a win over Miami on Jan. 5.",
      "It was a vintage performance \u2014 and a somewhat frustrating flash to fans of how things could have gone for Rodgers and the Jets.",

      "Paula Moltzan knows the feeling all too well.",
      "Already at this year's Alpine skiing world championships, she was on the U.S. squad that finished fourth in the mixed team parallel event. Then she couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead that partner Lauren Macuga had set up in the downhill portion of the new team combined event and ended up fourth with her slalom run.",
      "Also on the U.S. team that finished fourth in the team parallel at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, Moltzan\u2019s only major medal had been a victory with the U.S. team in the same event at the last worlds two years ago.",
      "Until Thursday, when Moltzan took the bronze medal in giant slalom for her first individual medal at this level, finishing a mere hundredth of a second ahead of Thea Louise Stjernesund of Norway \u2014 in a race won by Federica Brignone of Italy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s feeling pretty special right now,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cSki racing big time comes down to the hundredths of a second. And so to be on the right side on a big stage feels pretty amazing. And to share it with my family and my husband and my whole team is unmatched.\u201d",
      "Moltzan was third in the opening run held in bright sunshine and then maintained her position in fading light during the second run. Knowing immediately that she had earned a medal, the Minnesota native pumped her arms up and down, threw her hands on top of her helmet in apparent disbelief and waved to her cheering squad in the stands decked out in USA hockey jerseys with Moltzan\u2019s name on the back.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my mom and my dad and my mother-in-law, my father-in-law. And then our two really good friends from Vermont and then my agent,\u201d Moltzan said.",
      "Of course, there was one other special person enjoying the medal, too: Husband Ryan Mooney, who is Moltzan\u2019s ski technician and unofficial coach, eventually skied down from the start and took part in the post-race podium celebration.",
      "Long regarded as the U.S. women\u2019s team\u2019s second-best technical skier behind Mikaela Shiffrin, Moltzan\u2019s medal came in a race that Shiffrin sat out as defending champion while still recovering her giant slalom form and mental state following a crash in November.",
      "Moltzan also finished third in the final World Cup giant slalom before the worlds. She had a string of solid results entering the last worlds, too, only to break her hand again while helping the Americans win the team event \u2014 which led to a DNF (did not finish) in giant slalom and forced her to sit out the slalom, which has traditionally been her best event.",
      "Moltzan won gold in slalom at the junior worlds a decade ago but then lost her spot on the U.S. team a year later because of poor results.",
      "So she enrolled at the University of Vermont and won the NCAA slalom title a year later. While still at UVM in 2018, she finished 17th in the World Cup slalom down the road at Killington, giving her enough World Cup points to head back over to Europe and resume World Cup racing.",
      "Only she still wasn\u2019t part of the U.S. team, meaning that she and then-boyfriend Mooney had to raise $50,000 on their own to travel and compete across the Alps.",
      "\u201cI definitely have an unconventional story,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cBut I\u2019m proud of every step of it and it feels good to add this to the list of accomplishments I have.\u201d",
      "Both of Moltzan\u2019s parents were ski instructors at Buck Hill in Minnesota and Moltzan moved into the elite program led there by Lindsey Vonn\u2019s former coach, Erich Sailer, when she was 12.",
      "Now she\u2019s established herself as a contender for a medal at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics, with Vonn also planning to compete at the age of 41.",
      "Moltzan became the fourth American woman to earn a medal at this year's worlds, after Macuga\u2019s bronze in the super-G, Breezy Johnson\u2019s downhill victory and gold for Johnson and Shiffrin in team combined.",
      "\u201cThe women\u2019s U.S. Ski Team right now is extremely strong in both tech and speed, and it feels like everything is just kind of working off each other,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cYou watch the speed girls compete and their passion and their speed and you just feel like, \u2019OK, well, I don\u2019t want to be the athlete or the team that doesn\u2019t medal today.' And obviously we\u2019re missing Mikaela Shiffrin here. But I think even without her, we are a very strong team in GS.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like it, and that\u2019s all I got,\" Tkachuk said after the U.S. beat Finland 6-1. Tkachuk and brother Brady each had two goals.",

      "There was no such reaction for Finland\u2019s national anthem that followed. Fans across Canada have booed the U.S. anthem at NHL and NBA games after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs against the country, prompting backlash from a close neighbor and longtime ally.",

I think the negativity has probably lessened over the last week. Hopefully it continues to lessen and that relations will be normal. But it\u2019s something obviously we\u2019re aware of.\u201d",
      "U.S. captain Auston Matthews was booed during a pregame ceremony before Canada vs. Sweden on Wednesday and then again when he was shown on video screens during warmups. Matthews said after his team's morning skate that he expected that reaction.",
      "\u201cThey might just be booing us because we\u2019re the U.S. team here, like Auston\u2019s getting booed a ton and whatnot,\" defenseman Zach Werenski said. \"Obviously, I\u2019m a proud American and I love playing for the USA and being an American. I don\u2019t want to get into the political side of it, but it is what it is. I like to just view it as they want us to lose because we\u2019re the U.S. team.\u201d",
      "Coach Mike Sullivan said his players are proud Americans but did not credit the anthem booing as any sort of motivation that contributed to the result.",
      "\u201cThe anthem, I'm not sure there\u2019s influence there,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThat\u2019s really not something that we can control. We just want to play hockey. We want to compete. We want to represent our nation in the right way.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe most coercive tactic defendants used upon the plaintiffs was telling them if they did not sign the contracts, they were not eligible to practice,\u201d John Pierce, the lawyer representing the players, said in a complaint filed last week at Los Angeles County superior court. \u201cIn turn, they would not be eligible to play games, and their football skills would deteriorate. Inability to practice meant closing the door on what they committed their whole life towards, eventually playing professional football. Plaintiffs had no real negotiation or any meaningful choice except signing what was presented to them without ever being instructed of the purpose of filming or being advised to read through the contract in its entirety.\u201d",
      "The complaint indicates East Mississippi sold merchandise involving the players portrayed in the series, but that the plaintiffs didn\u2019t receive any compensation. It also says Wright, Ollie and Franklin were portrayed in a false light, damaging their reputations.",

      "Olympian and 1977 Boston Marathon champion Jerome Drayton has died at the age of 80",
      "TORONTO -- Jerome Drayton, who finished sixth at the Montreal Olympics, won the 1977 Boston Marathon and held the Canadian men\u2019s marathon record for 43 years, has died. He was 80.",
      "Drayton died unexpectedly on Monday in Toronto, according to Cardinal Funeral Homes. Runners World magazine said he died during knee surgery.",
      "Born in Germany with the name Peter Buniak, Drayton changed his name after immigrating to Canada in 1956. He won Detroit's Motor City Marathon in 1969 in a North American record time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and shaved 47 seconds off the mark in winning the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan later that year.",
      "He won the 1973 Canadian championship before finishing third in Boston in 1974. Three years later \u2014 his fifth try in Boston \u2014 he pulled ahead when eventual four-time winner Bill Rodgers began to tire in the 77-degree heat and gave Canada its first victory in the race in three decades. Drayton finished second at the New York Marathon that fall.",
      "\u201cJerome remains the most recent Open Division Men\u2019s Champion from Canada, and set the stage for generations of world class Canadian marathoners to follow in his footsteps,\u201d Boston Athletic Association President Jack Fleming said.",
      "Drayton also set a world record on the track for the 10-mile run in 1970 in 46:37.6, and was the top Canadian in the men's marathon at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. The Canada Sports Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1978, said that Drayton held 12 national titles and set 13 records in his career.",
      "After retiring, Drayton worked as a consultant with the Sports and Fitness Division of Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Youth, Culture and Recreation.",
      "\u201cHe was a runner who cared not only about his own performance but the growth and development of the sport,\" Fleming said. \u201cThe feedback and interest he showed in the Boston Marathon undoubtedly helped shape the marathon in the late 70s and beyond.\u201d"

    "summary": "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for &ldquo;world-class drivers&rdquo; could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
    "story": [
      "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\u201d could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\" could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500, and, should the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner use the provisional, it would make for the largest field in a decade.",
      "It's a complicated rule that was written into the charter agreement that 13 teams signed last September and is similar to a \u201cpromoters provisional\u201d in that it gives NASCAR the ability to designate one driver as a guaranteed 41st entry.",
      "Three-time Daytona 500 Denny Hamlin said the rule \u201creeks of desperation\u201d by NASCAR, calling it nothing but a gimmick to attract big stars to stock car racing. Others wondered why the provisional went to Castroneves, who at 49 will be making his NASCAR debut, instead of seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, a two-time Daytona 500 winner.",
      "The rule is designed for drivers who don't currently race full time in NASCAR, so Johnson and 2017 Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. would have been eligible for consideration for the provisional.",
      "But their teams never put in the request, which must be done 90 days before the event. Only Trackhouse Racing requested the provisional for Castroneves, who enters Wednesday's qualifying as the only driver eligible for the 41st spot.",
      "\u201cI think Jimmie Johnson is a world-class driver, but I guess other people don\u2019t,\u201d Alex Bowman said. \"It\u2019s an interesting rule for sure. There\u2019s a lot of hype and importance to the sport to have people like (Castroneves) that come in and, if they miss the race, it kind of hurts the whole thing.",
      "\"So I get it, but I also wish some of our past champions were respected in the same way in some sense.\u201d",
      "Castroneves will use the provisional only if he fails in traditional qualifying to claim one of the four open spots in what was supposed to be a 40-car field. If he uses it, the 41 cars will be the most in the Daytona 500 since 2015, when 43 cars was still standard.",
      "Trackhouse and Castroneves also won't receive any points or payouts if he's the 41st driver, and all drivers who finish behind him will be moved up one position in the standings.",
      "The rule has divided the field, even though it probably will come into play only at Daytona International Speedway, where nine drivers are vying for the four open spots. NASCAR's charter system guarantees entry to 36 cars every race.",
      "\u201cAside from the Daytona 500, we don\u2019t get in a spot very often where drivers of that caliber are going home,\" Tyler Reddick said. \"I don\u2019t know where to fall on this. On one hand, I would hate for a guy like Lewis Hamilton to come over here and attempt to start the 500... (and) something keeps him from running the race. We also don\u2019t just want to let them have a spot in the race \u2014 like, they have to earn it.\u201d",
      "Logically, if multiple drivers had requested the provisional, the most sense would have been for it to go to the highest qualifier.",
      "Nope.",
      "If NASCAR does receive multiple requests, NASCAR will decide who the designated \u201cworld-class driver\u201d is ahead of the event. The criteria listed in the charter for the rule states \"the \u201cOpen Exemption\u201d position is intended for a driver who will significantly impact the promotion of the event and grow the prominence of the sport.",
      "In a competition briefing held for media last month, a hypothetical scenario was posed about what NASCAR would do if seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton, four-time F1 champion Max Verstappen, six-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and Johnson, who is also a NASCAR Hall of Famer, all put in a request for the same race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have that problem,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president of racing development.",
      "NASCAR could have that problem later this year when it goes to Mexico City, where several teams are exploring deals to enter Juan Pablo Montoya in the race, and who knows who could show up at a road course \u2014 Shane van Gisbergen was brought into the inaugural street race at Chicago, won it and by the end of the year had left his Australian V8 Supercars career behind for NASCAR.",
      "At Indianapolis in 2023, former F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kamui Kobayashi were both in the field, while Button was part of the same field as Kimi Raikkonen to make it two F1 world champions in the 2023 race at Circuit of the Americas.",
      "\u201cI can argue both sides of the fence. You\u2019d hate to have a Helio Castroneves, a Max Verstappen, a Lewis Hamilton or someone come in to run a race and then miss the show due to something silly,\u201d Chase Elliott said. \"So I can certainly see that aspect of it from a promoter. But I also think that with prestigious races, there should be some sort of integrity in making the show.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s part of what makes the race prestigious. You know, it\u2019s a hard event to make. I think you see that with the Indianapolis 500, or you see that at the Chili Bowl, right? It\u2019s a hard race to make. It\u2019s a big deal just to get into the show. I just don\u2019t want to ever degrade or hurt the long-term integrity of the sport and take the prestige out of events that should be some of our biggest days of the year.\u201d",

      "About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk-contest days were done",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk contest days were done. He'd been in the contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend twice, won it both times with plenty of flair and figured there was nothing else to prove.",
      "Then a week later, he found himself practicing new dunks. And that's when he quickly realized that he has one \u2014 and he insists, only one \u2014 dunk contest left in him.",
      "\u201cI love the contest, man,\" McClung said. \u201cIt'd be an action in fear not to do it again. So, I'll do it \u2014 one last time.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-2 McClung \u2014 a standout guard in the G League who has appeared in only five NBA games \u2014 is headed back to All-Star weekend, looking to become the first person to win the league's dunk title in three consecutive years. Nate Robinson is the only three-time dunk champion, though his didn't come in back-to-back-to-back years.",
      "McClung breathed new life into the dunk contest and got rave reviews from some of the NBA's biggest names when he first won it in 2023, then went airborne over Shaquille O'Neal to win it again last year. Now he goes for three in a row in San Francisco on Saturday night, with San Antonio rookie Stephon Castle, Chicago rookie Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee second-year wing Andre Jackson Jr. providing the competition.",
      "\u201cI'm not going there to lose,\u201d Buzelis said.",
      "Added Jackson: \u201cI just want to be myself and put on a show.\u201d",
      "Castle is confident as well, though acknowledged he expects to feel some nerves on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI get nervous for most games,\u201d Castle said. \u201cI think it's just going to be another event for me.\u201d",
      "When this weekend is over, they'll all head back to their NBA jobs. McClung, for now, continues to wait for a real opportunity.",
      "His five NBA games have come with four NBA teams \u2014 one with Chicago, one with the Los Angeles Lakers, two with Philadelphia and one with Orlando. He's scored 33 points in those games, 20 coming in one contest with the 76ers at Brooklyn on April 9, 2023.",
      "He hasn't scored an NBA point since that day.",
      "\u201cThe easy answer is opportunity,\" McClung said. \u201cIt's not just Mac McClung. There's a lot of G League guys that can play in the league. There\u2019s a lot of guys I\u2019ve seen in the G League and then they get an opportunity in the (NBA) and people are like, \u2018Man, he got so much better this last year.' And I'm like, \u2018No, he\u2019s been good.' I really have my faith in God, and believe I\u2019m always right where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d",
      "For now, that's with the Osceola Magic. He's on a two-way contract with Orlando, and McClung is averaging 24.5 points and 6.1 assists during this G League regular season. He's been rookie of the year, he's been a G League champion and this season he's the reigning G League MVP.",
      "\u201cI take pride in the G League,\u201d McClung said. \u201cEach year it's so hard because when you're on a two-way people are like \u2018Be ready, stay ready.\u2019 But I'm trying to win in the G League. That's important to me. Winning a championship is always the standard and hopefully we can do that this year in Osceola and apply even more pressure.\u201d",
      "Winning back-to-back dunk contests has brought a ton of notoriety. People recognize McClung more now, but he hasn't changed. He's comfortable in jeans and T-shirts, drives a Ford Bronco, has the same group of friends that will smack him back in line if he gets out of line. He's proud to be the small-town kid from Gate City, Virginia \u2014 who just happens to be able to jump higher than most people and has become one of the most famous dunkers in the world.",
      "He's been offered chances to play in Europe for bigger money than he's making in the G League, too. But the dream remains the NBA, and McClung isn't ready to give up on it. He's always been the underdog and typically has found a way to turn his hopes into reality.",
      "\u201cIt's funny. I don\u2019t even look at myself as a dunker,\" McClung said. \u201cThe people that know me best know I'm a competitor first. Obviously, I haven\u2019t made an impact in the league yet or anything like that, but that\u2019s who I want to be and where I want to be. That\u2019s truly where my heart is.\u201d",
      "He'll be back on the NBA stage on Saturday, with a shot at dunking his way into history.",

      "The 27-year-old Horwitz hit .265 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs in 97 games with Toronto last season. The Blue Jays shipped him to Cleveland in December and hours later the Guardians sent him to Pittsburgh in exchange for pitcher Luis Ortiz and two prospects.",
      "Horwitz had been dealing with what the Pirates called a \u201cchronic\u201d wrist problem. Cherington said the team was aware of the issue at the time of the trade but Horwitz began to experience \u201cnew symptoms\u201d in late January, which led to the decision to have surgery.",
      "The Pirates have multiple internal options to fill first base while Horwitz rehabs, including utility infielder Jared Triolo and Darick Hall, who split time between first base and designated hitter with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2022 and 2023. Hall hit 16 home runs in Triple-A last season.",
      "While outfielder Bryan Reynolds took ground balls at first base during practice late in the 2024 season, Cherington said the team is focused on keeping Reynolds in the outfield. Endy Rodriguez, who hasn't played in the majors since undergoing elbow surgery in the fall of 2023, is expected to remain at catcher for now.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia officials are expecting 1 million people in the city Friday for a parade honoring the Philadelphia Eagles after their Super Bowl win.",
      "The team plans to descend the Rocky steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art at around 2 p.m. for a 75-minute ceremony, city leaders said at a Tuesday press conference.",
      "A replay of the team\u2019s 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday will be shown on large screens nearby.

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

    "summary": "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
    "story": [
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call. Rick Barry and Bob Cousy each fouled out of All-Star Games twice, the only players who can say that. Dwyane Wade was whistled for the first flagrant All-Star foul after breaking Kobe Bryant\u2019s nose.",
      "As the story goes, Wade called Bryant not long after that 2012 game and attempted to apologize. Turned out, there was no need. Wade\u2019s recollection of what Bryant said? \u201cBro, I love it,\u201d Wade said in a conversation with Kevin Garnett, a clip that has been a social media standard ever since.",
      "The NBA doesn't want coaches to get kicked out, anyone to get into foul trouble or anyone getting hurt. But they've asked, begged and pleaded for years with players in an effort that the All-Star Game get taken more seriously. And the latest solution is a radical one: a mini-tournament.",
      "Welcome to an All-Star format like none other: three games, no clock, first team to 40 points wins, eight-man rosters, and there's a reasonable chance that the team leaving San Francisco on Sunday as winners will have captured that title without having a single All-Star on its roster.",
      "\u201cWe went back to the drawing board,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.",
      "Here's the big question going into Sunday: Will it work?",
      "To be fair, there were skeptics when Silver added a play-in tournament to determine the final two playoff spots in the Eastern and Western Conferences; by all accounts, the play-in has been a smashing success. There were skeptics when Silver added an in-season tournament now called the NBA Cup; some players say they still don't totally understand the format, but the first two Cup final four weekends in Las Vegas have been big hits as well.",
      "Now, this. The NBA thinks players don't want to go to a 48-minute All-Star Game and play hard for a full game. Perfectly understandable. The proposed solution: short games, where nobody will have to play for long and there's little room for error since only 40 points are needed to win.",
      "Kevin Durant's first response? \u201cI hate it. Absolutely hate it. Terrible,\u201d the Phoenix star and 15-time All-Star said when the league announced the plan in December, though he quickly noted that his initial reaction could have been worded differently.",
      "Perhaps he could have taken the route that perennial All-Star forward Anthony Davis, then of the Los Angeles Lakers and now of the Dallas Mavericks, took when he was asked in December what he thinks of the NBA's new plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like it,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see how it goes this year and see if they change it again or not.\u201d",
      "And it could change again, possibly as early as next year.",
      "Some players want the traditional East vs. West format, although the league went back to that last year and it was a 211-186 game \u2014 all dunks and 3-pointers, pretty much \u2014 that broke records and forced the NBA to break the mold on the format.",
      "The NBA tried a target score approach; no clock in the fourth quarter and have the teams chase a set total to ensure that the game ends on a made basket. Some years it worked, some years not so much. They tried having playing captains pick the teams; again, success was mixed.",
      "Next up, the tournament. There is a prize pool of $1.8 million for the All-Star tournament. Each player on the All-Star champion team gets $125,000, each player on the runner-up team will get $50,000 and the players on the teams eliminated in the semifinals will each get $25,000.",
      "\u201cI don't know if everyone understands how this is going to go,\u201d said Miami's Tyler Herro, who'll make his All-Star debut this weekend. \u201cBut everyone will want to win.\u201d",
      "There are four teams in the tournament: three teams picked by Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley from the pool of 24 All-Stars, and the fourth will be the team that wins the Rising Stars event on Friday night. The Rising Stars players aren't All-Stars. Some aren't even in the NBA right now; there's a G League team in that event. And the Rising Stars winner could win the All-Star Game \u2014 meaning, yes, guys who aren't currently in the league could win the thing.",
      "Whichever way it shakes out, it will be a massive deviation from last year \u2014 when the East and West each scored at least 42 points in every quarter. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 50 points on his own last year; it'll take only 40 for a team to win a game this year.",
      "\u201cThem trying to shake things up is expected and makes sense,\u201d Oklahoma City All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"But at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to come down to whether the players wanting to go at it, and I would love to see that. Love to be a part of that for sure, and hopefully it happens.\u201d",
      "Heat forward Kevin Love \u2014 who proudly says he took part in All-Star Games where players were competitive and even strategized in the locker rooms before games and at halftimes \u2014 doesn't know when the All-Star Game changed.",
      "He thinks it became part of the evolution within the game; more 3-pointers are shot than ever before and that, combined with everyone just treating it like an exhibition and not Game 7 of the NBA Finals, led to the defense-optional approach the league doesn't want to see anymore.",
      "\u201cI'll tell you if this will work,\u201d Love said. \u201cI'll tell you on Sunday.\u201d",

      "FIFA is running the World Cup itself unlike in the past, when a local organizing committee was in charge of logistics. FIFA did not respond to a request for FIFA president Gianni Infantino and Heimo Schirgi, chief operating officer of the tournament, to discuss the World Cup.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to really be handling what goes on inside the stadium,\u201d Lasry said. \u201cThe soccer match, that's going to be a lot of FIFA. We\u2019re going to be working with FIFA on security and our day-to-day responsibilities are to raise money to help put on the fan fests, to make sure that our security and transportation are all set and then also making sure that we\u2019re engaging with the communities to kind of explain to everyone what the benefits of this are going to be.\u201d",

      "Lasry said the semifinals and championship of the first expanded Club World Cup at East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium this July will be a dry run for the 2026 event.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to look at it from a security and transportation standpoint on, OK, where did things go really well? Where do we have some gaps? What went well but that we can do better?\u201d Lasry said.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her government wouldn't rule out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Google and Poland on Thursday signed a memorandum for developing the use of artificial intelligence in the country's energy, cybersecurity and other sectors.",
      "Poland has largely cut its previous dependence on Russian fuels, and is being targeted by various forms of cyberattacks and sabotage actions believed to be sponsored by Russia.",
      "Google and Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai and Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk met to discuss expanding Google operations in Poland that were launched in 2014. Pichai said that Poland is Google\u2019s biggest engineering hub with more than 2,000 employees.",
      "Apart from getting AI involved in the strategic sectors in Poland, Google is also dedicating $5 million over the next five years to expand training programs and increase digital skills among young Poles. It is to reach about 1 million young Poles, Pichai said.",
      "Tusk said the plans will increase Poland\u2019s security and will contribute to the country\u2019s economic development. Earlier this week he said that Google and Microsoft will be among international businesses that will invest some 650 billion zlotys ($ 160 billion) in Poland in 2025.",
      "Tusk also invited Google to contribute to the deregulating efforts in Poland that aim to cut on red tape and regulations and give businesses more space for development."

    "summary": "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral industry",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- A recording released by the federal government appears to include audio of the implosion of the experimental submersible that went missing on its way to the wreck of the Titanic.",
      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",
      "The brief, staticky recording includes a loud noise that sounds somewhat like an underwater thunderclap. It then goes silent for its remaining few seconds.",
      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the audio clip \u201crecords the suspected acoustic signature of the Titan submersible implosion\u201d on June 18, 2023, the day the submersible went missing.",
      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September. The testimony included dramatic moments, such as when a former OceanGate scientific director said the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before its implosion.",
      "The Coast Guard is expected to release more information about the implosion in the future. A spokesperson for the agency said Wednesday the investigation is still ongoing and a final report will be released after it is completed."

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The Italian government denied Wednesday that it had spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware but said it would cooperate with an investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade surveillance technology.",
      "Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.",
      "In a statement provided by Meta\u2019s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called \u201ca spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.\u201d",
      "After The Guardian newspaper reported the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier\u2019s office, to investigate.",
      "It said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.",
      "Speaking to parliament\u2019s lower chamber Wednesday, Cabinet Minister Luca Ciriani confirmed that the Italian government for many years has had a contract with Paragon Solutions to provide intelligence-gathering capabilities to fight terrorism and other threats to national security.",

The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",

      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",

      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt.

Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman\u2019s push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company",
      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

      "Neutrinos spew from stars like the sun and trillions stream through our bodies every second. They're known as ghost particles because their mind-bogglingly small mass makes them difficult to spot.",

      "Two years ago, a neutrino collided with matter and produced a tiny particle called a muon that pinged through the underwater detector, producing flashes of blue light. The researchers worked backward to estimate the energy of the neutrino and published their findings Wednesday in the journal Nature.",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",

      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",
      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",
      "The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture.",
      "A global public-private partnership named \u201cCurrent AI\u201d will be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest.",
      "The Paris summit \u201cis the first time we\u2019ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,\u201d said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. \u201cI see it as a norm-setting moment.\u201d",
      "Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by \u201cmoving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.\"",
      "However, it remains unclear if the United States will support such initiatives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complicated questions to resolve\u201d around issues like the ability to control AI systems, Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, founder of Google\u2019s DeepMind research lab, said. \u201cBut also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\u201d",
      "French organizers are also looking for the summit to ignite major investment announcements in Europe, positioning the region as a viable contender in an industry increasingly shaped by a growing U.S.-China rivalry.",
      "France plans to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project.",
      "On the eve of the AI Summit, Macron posted a series of 'deepfake' videos of himself on Instagram, using artificial intelligence to manipulate his voice and image in various parodies\u2014an effort he said was meant to spark debate on AI\u2019s potential and risks.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun expressed opposition Monday to any moves to restrict access to AI tools. The release of DeepSeek has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe oppose drawing ideological lines and oppose overstretching national security concepts and politicizing economic and trade issues,\u201d Guo said.",
      "He said that China advocates for open-source AI technology and promotes the accessibility of AI services to share the benefits of artificial intelligence with all countries.",
      "Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle.",
      "India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.\u201d",
      "Macron will also travel on Wednesday with Modi to the southern French port city of Marseille to inaugurate an Indian Consulate there and visit the ITER nuclear research site.",
      "France has become a key defense partner for India, with talks underway on New Delhi purchasing 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Officials in India said that discussions are at the final phase and the deal could be inked in a few weeks.",

      "Ali issued a narrowly tailored temporary restraining order that prohibits the Trump administration from cutting off congressionally appropriated foreign aid or canceling any contracts for federal foreign aid assistance.

      "According to a probable cause filing submitted to the court, the FBI's Sandy Hook Promise Say Something Anonymous Reporting System contacted the local sheriff after a tipster said their friend was planning an attack, had access to an AR-15 rifle and had just ordered a bulletproof vest.",
      "It said the tip revealed that the person in question was obsessed with Nikolas Cruz, the mass murderer who opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, 2018. He killed 14 students and three staff members.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump have claimed from the Oval Office and on social media widespread fraud in government, but many of them are unsupported by facts.",
    "story": [
      "Musk has admitted he has made some errors in his claims.",
      "President Donald Trump said he would provide details Thursday of what he and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claim are billions of dollars of wasteful and fraudulent government spending.",
      "\"I'm going to read to you some of the names that hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars have been given to,\" the president said in a news conference Wednesday.",
      "But the president had not produced his list as of Thursday evening.",
      "In the weeks since Trump's inauguration, he and Musk have made claims from the Oval Office and on social media about specific programs such as disaster relief for states, lodging for migrants in cities and that 150-year-olds are receiving Social Security payments. However, what few details were provided were vague, unsupported and sometimes false.",
      "In fact, Musk admitted Tuesday that some of its claims might be \"incorrect.\"",
      "During his first news conference since starting DOGE, Musk backtracked on a claim that $50 million was spent by the federal government to give condoms to Gaza and Hamas. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt first made that claim at a White House briefing last month and was spread wide by Trump, Musk and Republican lawmakers.",
      "In fact, the condoms were sent to a province in Mozambique named Gaza as part of an HIV prevention measure.",
      "\"Some of the things I say may be incorrect and should be corrected. Nobody's batting 1.000,\" Musk told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We all make mistakes, but we'll act to quickly correct any mistakes.\"",
      "Musk claimed that he and DOGE have been \"fully public\" with \"all of our actions,\" but much of DOGE's activity across numerous federal agencies has been learned through reporting, reaction from government employees affected by DOGE's actions, or when DOGE and agency heads shut down government offices and sent employees home.",
      "The updates that DOGE and Musk provide on his X social media platform are often vague and often don't contain documentation.",
      "On Thursday, the billionaire reposted to his 217.5 million followers on X a claim that Reuters was awarded $9 million by the Department of Defense for a \"social engineering\" program and called it a \"scam.\" Trump passed the claim along on his Truth Social platform, posting \"GIVE BACK THE MONEY NOW!\"",
      "However, public records show the contract was awarded in 2018, during Trump's first term, to Thompson Reuters Special Services division, not its news organization, following a request from the previous year from a Department of Defense agency for research on \"automated defense social engineering attacks.\"",
      "Washington Post tech reporter Drew Harwell was one of the first to point out the specifics of the Reuters contracts Thursday morning in Bluesky posts.",
      "Musk promised DOGE would use \"maximum transparency\" in its actions, even before Trump was elected in November. He said it would do weekly \"DOGE casts\" on X and update its Doge.gov website with its activity.",
      "At the time of Tuesday's Oval Office news conference when Musk was asked about transparency, the site showed only a logo and a slogan, but a day later, it was populated with posts from the DOGE X account, a regulations page that featured a bar graph of \"agency rules created by unelected bureaucrats\" and a \"workforce\" page that listed headcount for federal workers.",
      "The website cites its \"sources\" as largely publicly available OPM data.",
      "The bottom of the page features the following notice by DOGE acknowledging \"there are likely some errors or omissions. We will continue to strive for maximum accuracy over time.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday to talk about the specifics of the fraud he found, Musk alleged there were people receiving Social Security benefits who were 150 years old. Musk did not provide any more details or specifics on how he found these people's Social Security information.",
      "Despite Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla being awarded at least $18 billion in federal contracts over the past decade and SpaceX winning more than $17 million worth of contracts since 2015, Musk did not squarely address his potential conflicts of interest with the government on Tuesday.",
      "On Wednesday, a procurement forecast document released by the State Department said Musk's Telsa is forecast to win a $400 million contract to provide \"armored Teslas\" to the State Department later this year.",
      "The contract, which was modified in December and scheduled to be awarded in September, is expected to last for five years, according to the procurement forecast document. However, the agency the next day updated its procurement forecast document, simply describing the procurement requirement as \"armored electric vehicles\" instead.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Rachel Scott if there were checks and balances in place to ensure that Musk's companies aren't benefitting from his access, he said that all of DOGE's actions are \"fully public.\"",
      "\"So, if you see anything you say like, 'Wait a second. Hey, you know what that does? That seems like maybe that's, you know, that there's a conflict there,'\" Musk said. \"It\u2019s not like people are going to be shy about saying that. They'll say it immediately.\"",
      "Musk did not elaborate on where such a complaint would be publicized or whether he would publicly acknowledge it.",
      "He said that DOGE's transparency will build trust.",
      "\"And then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Ukraine and key European nations demanded a role in any negotiations to end Russia's war on the country, after President Donald Trump announced they would begin.",
    "story": [
      "Trump said he and Putin agreed to begin talks to end the war \"immediately.\"",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy bluntly protested against the U.S. and Russia negotiating over Ukraine's head, after President Donald Trump unilaterally announced an immediate start to direct peace talks with President Vladimir Putin to end the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.",
      "Trump said in a post to social media on Wednesday that he spoke with Putin by phone, adding the two leaders \"agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately\" to end the fighting in Ukraine after nearly three years of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "Trump's announcement came shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told allies that Ukraine cannot liberate all territory occupied by Russian forces and will not be given NATO security protection as part of any peace deal.",
      "\"We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,\" he told reporters, while also adding that Europe needs to be involved.",
      "Zelenskyy also told reporters that 100,000 European troops would be needed as peacekeepers to police a ceasefire in Ukraine if real security guarantees are not provided by the U.S. and NATO. He repeated an idea of a \"Plan B\" he raised earlier this week -- that if Ukraine does not receive security guarantees or NATO membership, then Ukraine must receive enough weapons to simply secure itself.",
      "When asked by a reporter at the Oval Office on Thursday if Ukraine would have a seat at the negotiation table, Trump responded, \"Of course they would.\"",
      "\"We would have Ukraine, would have Russia, and we'll have other people involved, too,\" he said.",
      "Germany protests 'regrettable' Trump 'concessions' to Putin on Ukraine",
      "NATO ministers quickly pushed back on Trump's actions.",
      "German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"regrettable\" that \"the Trump administration has already made public concessions to Putin before negotiations have even begun.\"",
      "Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur concurred. \"We must not hand Russia any advantage before negotiations even begin,\" Pevkur said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth rejected the premise that Trump has weakened his bargaining position with Putin during a press conference at NATO on Thursday.",
      "\"It's just a cheap political point to say, 'Oh, we've left all the negotiating cards off the table by recognizing some realities that exist on the ground,'\" Hegseth said. \"President Zelenskyy understands the realities on the ground, President Putin understands the realities on the ground, and President Trump, as a dealmaker, as a negotiator, understands those dynamics as well.\"",
      "\"By no means is anything that I state here, even though we lead the most powerful military in the world, hemming in the commander in chief in his negotiations to ultimately decide where it goes or does not go -- he's got all the cards he would like,\" he continued.",
      "'Everything is on the table' in talks: Hegseth",
      "Though Hegseth has called the possibility of NATO membership for Ukraine unrealistic, he said Thursday that those remarks have no bearing on the options Trump could exercise, saying, \"Everything is on the table in his conversations with Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Moscow launched its attack in February 2022 with the aim of toppling Zelenskyy's government in Kyiv and annexing swaths of the country. The \"special military operation\" -- as the Kremlin termed the invasion -- expanded on Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its fomentation of, and active military support for, separatist rebellion in parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014.",
      "\"I think we're on the way to getting peace,\" Trump said. He did not clarify whether Ukraine and Zelenskyy would be directly involved in any peace talks.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview Thursday that Ukraine will be involved in talks over the settlement of the war, but the U.S. will be the main intermediary with Russia during the talks.",
      "\"Of course, we understand that Washington is our main vis-a-vis in this process,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"One way or another, Ukraine will of course participate in talks,\" he added.",
      "Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine be sidelined in the talks, having dismissed Zelenskyy as \"illegitimate.\" That deviates from years of U.S. and allied policy, under which former President Joe Biden was guided by the \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\" principle, with the former president also refusing to speak directly with Putin while the war continued.",
      "Putin, Trump did not discuss Europe's participation, Kremlin says",
      "The call between Putin and Trump did not involve a discussion of Europe's participation in negotiations aimed at settling the Ukrainian conflict, Peskov said in another interview Thursday.",
      "\"This was not discussed in any way. And European affairs were not touched on in any way during yesterday's conversation,\" Peskov said.",
      "Europe will \"need to talk to Washington to somehow stake out its place,\" he said.",
      "Ukraine and American allies in Europe have called for a unified negotiating front.",
      "\"We are looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies,\" said a joint statement from the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain, the U.K., Ukraine, the European Union's European External Action Service and the European Commission.",
      "\"Our shared objectives should be to put Ukraine in a position of strength,\" the statement added. \"Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations.\"",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign affairs chief, said on X, \"Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity are unconditional.\"",
      "Trump spoke with Zelenskyy after Putin call",
      "Trump spoke with Zelenskyy after his phone call with Putin. The Ukrainian leader said in a post to social media that the two discussed \"opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together at the team level, and Ukraine's technological capabilities -- including drones and other advanced industries.\"",
      "Addressing the conversation, Trump said on Truth Social that Zelenskyy, \"like President Putin, wants to make PEACE.\"",
      "Trump separately hinted at the expiry of Zelenskyy's presidential term. Ukraine was due to hold presidential elections last year, but the vote was delayed as the country is still under martial law as a result of Russia's invasion. At \"some point you're going to have an election,\" Trump said.",
      "During his remarks Thursday, Zelenskyy acknowledged Trump calling Putin first was \"not very pleasant\" but said what mattered now was that Trump meet him before meeting Putin.",
      "\"We've already had three conversations with President Trump, so I don't consider this call a priority or see it as him choosing to talk to Russia first. Still, it's not very pleasant in any case,\" he said. \"If calls are just calls, I understand, but meetings are our priority. Ukraine, America, and only after those meetings, after working out a plan to stop Putin, would it be fair to talk with the Russians.\"",
      "Trump said a meeting between Zelenskyy, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was scheduled during the weekend Munich Security Conference event in Germany.",
      "Trump said he would meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia, though did not set a date.",
      "The State Department said that Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg will begin a 10-day visit to Germany, Belgium and Ukraine on Thursday.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Peskov told reporters that Moscow had begun preparing a negotiating group to organize a meeting between Trump and Putin.",
      "\"Definitely started. And as the president makes the appropriate decisions, we will inform you,\" Peskov said.",
      "When asked if a visit by U.S. representatives to Moscow is expected in the near future, Peskov said: \"Not yet. So far, there are no specific agreements in this regard.\"",
      "More reaction to Trump, Hegseth remarks",
      "Hegseth preceded Trump's latest remarks by telling allies in Belgium on Wednesday that Ukraine cannot liberate all territory from Russian occupation, and that Kyiv will not be given NATO security protection as part of any peace deal.",
      "\"The bloodshed must stop and this war must end,\" Hegseth said. His address was the most detailed delineation of the Trump administration's desired peace deal since the president returned to the Oval Office.",
      "Pro-talk signals from the U.S. raised concerns in Ukraine and abroad that Kyiv will be forced into territorial and political concessions in exchange for an end to the fighting.",
      "John Bolton -- Trump's former national security adviser -- for example, said on X that the president's approach is tantamount to a \"sell out\" of Ukraine. \"Trump has effectively surrendered to Putin on Ukraine.\"",
      "The latest remarks from Trump and Hegseth also stoked concerns inside Ukraine. \"It's a bad sign that he has talked first to Putin, not to Zelenskyy,\" Oleksandr Merezhko -- a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee -- told ABC News.",
      "\"Such a phone call is in itself a reward for Putin,\" he added. \"It's sort of a break in his political isolation.\"",
      "Still, Merezhko said Trump's approach does \"not quite\" mean a total exclusion of Ukraine. \"The principle 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine' is more about not taking decisions without Ukraine which have influence upon Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Pressure for peace is building within and without. A Gallup poll published in November indicated that most Ukrainians favored a rapid end to the devastating war. Zelenskyy's public rhetoric largely reflects this sentiment, though the president has warned that no peace deal is sustainable without concrete U.S. security guarantees.",
      "\"This war of attrition is only going to make us weaker,\" Iuliia Mendel -- Zelenskyy's former press secretary -- told ABC News. \"For a long time, Ukraine has been at the stage when negotiations are urgent to save the nation.\"",
      "Moscow and Kyiv maneuvering for leverage",
      "Both Moscow and Kyiv are maneuvering for leverage in preparation for revived talks. This week, Russia and the U.S. concluded a prisoner swap described by Trump as a goodwill gesture that could help advance peace talks.",
      "Zelenskyy, meanwhile, met with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv to discuss a potential deal to secure U.S. access to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Ukrainian minerals.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian leaders have both expressed readiness to resume negotiations, though neither side has indicated willingness to make significant concessions.",
      "This week, Zelenskyy suggested Ukraine would be ready to give up territory it seized in Russia's western Kursk region in exchange for the liberation of some Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow's troops.",
      "Peskov dismissed the idea as \"impossible\" at a Wednesday briefing with journalists. \"Russia has never discussed an exchange of its territories and never will,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"Naturally, Ukrainian units will be ousted from this territory. Everyone who is not eliminated will be ousted,\" Peskov added.",

    "title": "What do Americans think about Trump's tariffs?",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:48:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Will Trump's tariffs hurt the economy, and how popular are they?",
    "story": [
      "Economists agree they would raise prices, and Americans agree that would be bad.",
      "Welcome to 538's politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.",
      "nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and elections analyst): Let's party like it's 1890, because it's tariff time, baby! On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs for virtually every country \u2014 meaning the U.S. will now levy the same amount on imports from a given country that that country levies on goods from the U.S. This, of course, is the culmination of a recent tariff spree from the White House: Earlier this week, he imposed a 25 percent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports \u2014 generally understood to be aimed at China, although it affects U.S. allies like Canada as well \u2014 and at the beginning of the month imposed a 10 percent tariff on all goods from China. (He has, for now, backed down from harsher tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were planned at the same time.)",
      "Of the many executive actions Trump has taken in office so far, these tariffs have the potential to be among the most consequential for the largest number of Americans. So how do Americans feel about them?",
      "tia.yang (Tia Yang, senior editor): Americans overall are fairly split over tariffs. Broadly speaking, polls this year have shown that increased or new tariffs are slightly unpopular among the public. At least two-thirds of Republicans tend to support them, while a larger share of Democrats consistently oppose them.",
      "But these numbers are still highly subject to change as Americans learn more about tariffs and their actual impacts. Right after the election, there was this trend where people were suddenly googling how tariffs worked, because it's sort of a wonky foreign/economic policy area that most voters probably hadn't thought much about. I think that's still true as this battle over Trump's tariff policies is still heating up.",
      "nrakich: Yep, Google searches for \"tariff\" increased right after the election, although the really big spike occurred at the beginning of February when Trump was engaged in that standoff with Canada and Mexico.",
      "Monica Potts (Monica Potts, senior politics reporter): In addition to what Tia said, one thing that has struck me most in looking at the survey data on how Americans feel about these tariffs is just how much uncertainty there is around them. In polls from this year, the percentage of respondents who chose \"neither\" or \"not sure\" when asked whether they supported or opposed tariffs has been as high as 25 percent. That's not surprising: While voters understand that tariffs are taxes charged on imported goods, they're also a pretty complicated policy issue. So it makes sense that the results of tariff polling vary depending on how the question is asked, what kind of tariffs we're talking about, etc.",
      "gelliottmorris (G. Elliott Morris, editorial director of data analytics): You know, Monica, you've reminded me that most Americans don't pay attention to politics pretty much at all, and when pollsters ask them to express an opinion, many are giving their first impression based on what little they may have heard about the issue, not necessarily an informed attitude. That's not to say we should ignore these polls \u2014 just that we have to be careful interpreting them.",
      "Monica Potts: Right, I imagine many Americans are still forming their opinions based on what they're hearing about the latest news.",
      "tia.yang: Several of the recent polls on this topic have asked both how Americans feel about tariffs and what they think the effects of those tariffs will be \u2014 and found that support for tariffs is mixed even as a solid majority (between 60 and 70 percent) consistently think those tariffs will increase the cost of goods in the U.S. However, the question about whether they think tariffs will drive up costs tends to be asked after the question about whether they support the tariffs. Support may be lower when costs are directly mentioned in the question about support for tariffs.",
      "For example, in a YouGov survey from January, just over half of those who initially said they'd favor increased tariffs on imported goods said they would still do so \"even if that leads to higher prices for American consumers,\" while 20 percent said they would no longer support the tariffs. The rest were unsure.",
      "In a Navigator Research poll, 37 percent of registered voters supported Trump's tariff plan and 41 percent opposed it, while at least 6 in 10 said tariffs would raise prices, similar to other polls. But what really caught my eye was another question that asked whether those higher costs were worth it \"if it helped to keep American manufacturing strong and protected American jobs.\" A slim plurality said it was worth it. That was driven largely by Republicans, 69 percent of whom said the trade-off was worth it. In comparison, only 21 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents said so.",
      "So Americans' support for Trump's tariff policies may hinge on not only whether prices go up, but also whether they see positive impacts on other economic metrics, like jobs.",
      "Monica Potts: For what it's worth, though, many economists don't think tariffs would be the best tool for the things Americans do want, like increasing jobs. Tariffs would raise some revenue for the government, but it would be hard to make them cover the tax cuts Trump is proposing. They do protect some domestic sectors when it makes sense, but broad-based tariffs could harm more than they help.",
      "So tariffs are kind of a blunt tool and negotiating tactic that Trump is using when the goals Americans really care about are more easily achieved through other policies.",
      "nrakich: We're starting to get into a discussion of the economic impacts of the tariffs, which was going to be my next question. Would they really hurt the economy as much as Trump's critics are warning?",
      "Monica Potts: I think most economists agree that tariffs would immediately increase consumer prices, to the tune of about $100 a month by some estimates. For what it's worth, many economists don't like tariffs. Not to get too wonky, but they just shift money from consumers to governments and producers \u2014 but not even that much money. Some of the value and efficiencies we get from trade are simply lost.",
      "There's another potential political cost as well. Watching Trump's threats of high tariffs, backing off, threatening again, etc., may simply make our trading partners wary of us. Trump paused his plans to impose tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, but do those countries' leaders and companies know that the U.S. is still a solid trading partner? What if Trump wants something else? Is he going to threaten tariffs every time he wants something? That could drive our allies into the arms of other big trading partners, like China. Companies just want to sell their goods; they don't want to be bargaining chips.",
      "Additionally, Trump's stated goal of increasing American manufacturing won't happen without other domestic policy changes that increase the potential for it. And it could take time to ramp up manufacturing in sectors where we currently rely heavily on imports, like steel and aluminum from China. Plus, so many of our imports, especially from Canada, are raw materials that we simply don't have enough of.",
      "gelliottmorris: Tariffs raise the prices of foreign goods and, because companies dealing with trade like to make money, those price hikes get passed on to consumers. This is not really a matter of projections or forecasting so much as it is a fact of how the tool works. Tariffs on goods --> prices of those goods rise for importers --> importers raise prices for distributors and the like --> those companies raise prices on consumers.",
      "The typical way this gets justified is that if prices for imports go up, then people will just flock to American-made goods. But that assumes three things that are simply not true: (a) that the U.S. has replacement goods in large supply for all affected commerce (looking at you, avocados); (b) that American companies would not raise prices to match those of foreign imports in order to increase profits (but price equilibrium typically approaches the old cost of the good + the new tariff); and (c) that the laws of supply and demand do not apply to local American goods (as increased demand increases prices). So there are really multiple ways in which consumers could suffer from these policies.",
      "The downstream effects of this could be quite severe. For example, decreasing imports of Mexican goods will hurt the Mexican economy, which could also exacerbate the problems at the border.",
      "nrakich: How severe are we talking? Like, recession? Summer-of-2022-level inflation?",
      "gelliottmorris: Well, America imported almost $440 billion worth of goods from China last year, and they're all about to get 10 percent more expensive. That's stuff like electronics (iPhones!) and a lot of basic manufactured goods that are too expensive to make in the U.S. given domestic labor costs.",
      "If Trump does go through with his tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the consequences could be even worse. Grocery prices rising by even 10 percent would match the inflation we saw in the summer of 2022. Twenty-five percent would nearly match the entire increase in the consumer price index for food at home from 2021 to 2024.",
      "Monica Potts: It really depends on what goes into effect, but Canada, Mexico and China together make up almost half of our trade. Cars are especially dependent on North American trade, and that's not just about imported raw materials or finished cars, but many of the components and parts that are part of the manufacturing process. Mexico grows most of the fresh produce we find in grocery stores. And imposing these tariffs could also just start a trade war that hurts our exports, too. So it could unleash chaos.",
      "It's interesting because fighting back against global free trade was the purview of the young left in the late 1990s and early 2000s, largely because they feared that the goals of organizations like the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund would result in labor laws getting bypassed and unfair wages. But Trump has a different set of goals, so it's not clear what will happen.",
      "tia.yang: Right, as Monica just said, we also have to consider the impacts of retaliatory tariffs that other countries have threatened to impose on American exports. The retaliatory tariffs proposed by Canada have prompted significant concern, including among Republican lawmakers who represent states or districts that depend heavily on trade with neighboring countries. For example, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell has spoken out against Trump's tariffs, not least because of the impacts that retaliatory tariffs would have on his state's huge bourbon industry.",
      "This backlash is particularly potent too in light of other administration moves that could negatively impact American agriculture (i.e., rural areas largely represented by Republicans). Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley called for Trump to include a tariff exemption for potash, a fertilizer imported in large quantities from Canada. And the dismantling of USAID food assistance programs that purchase food from American farmers to send abroad has raised alarm bells as well.",
      "nrakich: That all sounds pretty bad! So why is Trump imposing/threatening all these tariffs when so many economists are opposed to them?",
      "tia.yang: Well, Trump is explicitly using tariffs as a bargaining or leverage tool, not just an economic one. He has long been focused on addressing America's \"trade deficit\" (the fact that we import more goods than we export), and that's still a big part of his rhetoric. But especially when it comes to his aggressive proposals of 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, he's brandishing tariffs as a way to exert pressure on non-economic issues like border security and cracking down on the importation of drugs like fentanyl.",
      "In fact, one poll from Atlas Intel actually found much higher support for raising tariffs against specific countries \"as a negotiation tactic\" than for across-the-board tariffs \"to protect U.S. manufacturing.\" The problem is, Americans don't want those tariffs to become actual policy. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico (especially Canada) are particularly unpopular, and I think that's in part because Americans are more aware that these tariffs would majorly impact their lives. An Abacus Data survey specifically showed that overwhelming majorities value free trade between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "I'd also note that unpopular North American tariffs would effectively undo one of the more popular accomplishments of Trump's first term, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which overhauled trade policy between the three countries. In the Abacus Data survey, 52 percent of Americans said the USMCA was good or very good for the U.S. Thirty-eight percent said it was neutral, and just 10 percent said it was bad.",
      "gelliottmorris: The other thing about Canada: It's uniquely hurt by Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs, which today are 25 percent but could be as high as 50 percent soon (an official said the overall and steel-based tariffs would \"stack\" on top of each other).",
      "I'm about to be a bit cheeky here, but these tariffs in particular fit two of Trump's broader goals: first, to deliver on promises he made to the steelworkers' union \u2014 and arguably protect a vital American industry. And second, to punish Canada for not being more serious about his desire to annex the country as our 51st state. (And it does seem like Trump has a pretty particular obsession with our northern neighbor.)",
      "tia.yang: Still less weird than his obsession with Greenland!",
      "Monica Potts: I actually think the obsession with Greenland makes more sense \u2014 but that's a different chat, LOL.",
      "More seriously, though: Trump may just be threatening Mexico and Canada as a negotiating tactic, but it's not clear that he really achieved anything with them. Both had already made plans to crack down on fentanyl passing through their borders with the U.S. and deploy more security to the borders. In the case of Canada, only about 0.2 percent of seizures of fentanyl captured by border security come through our border with them.",
      "This is a broader point about the effects tariffs might have overall. Again, if the goal is to increase American manufacturing jobs, that's debatable. It would take a while to build new things \u2014 and it might not even be possible! For example, when Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs after its president briefly refused to accept a flight carrying deported immigrants, Colombia backed down. But what if it hadn't? One of our biggest imports from Colombia is coffee, and most of the U.S. isn't suited to growing coffee (although we do produce some). So we would just import it from other countries, and we might pay more because importing it from those countries costs more, and it might not match American consumer tastes, etc.",
      "This is, incidentally, the whole point of trade: Countries can concentrate on what they're good at and everyone gains value (in theory) if those goods can flow freely between borders.",
      "gelliottmorris: Yeah, and to that point, Monica, the American people's patience with Trump may soon run out. Wednesday's CPI release showed inflation had risen again in January. If former President Joe Biden's tenure is any indicator, that is a surefire way to find yourself on the outs with the American people.",
      "tia.yang: Morning Consult's consumer sentiment index also caught my eye and showed that the public may already be responding negatively to the potential economic impacts of tariffs, which have been in the spotlight for a couple of weeks now. Consumer confidence has fallen since its post-election high point on Jan. 25, in a reversal of the positive trend that followed the election.",
      "Another Morning Consult survey showed that few want Trump to prioritize tariffs (23 percent), but many see him doing so (47 percent).",
      "gelliottmorris: My overall takeaway from the polling is that the administration's public justification for the tariffs is popular, but the policy implementation isn't. For example, a co/efficient poll from late January found that 49 percent of Americans approved \"of President Trump's plan to impose tariffs to bring back American jobs and ensure fair international trade,\" while 42 percent disapproved. That makes sense: Who wouldn't favor fairness and jobs?",
      "But the numbers just ain't there for the details. When Ipsos/Reuters asked Americans if they wanted tariffs even if it meant prices would go up, only 30 percent of Americans said yes; 47 percent said no.",
      "This is a theme we've seen with immigration polling, too; people generally want to secure the southern border and reduce immigration, but they oppose the things that go along with that, the administration's strict enforcement policies such as arresting migrants at school or church and separating kids from their undocumented parents.",
      "So because of this divide between goals and implementation, you get an administration that is really leaning into its messaging. Trump has pitched his actions as necessary for America's national interests, even if that means costs go up. I think it's unlikely that most people will agree the trade-offs are worth it.",
      "Monica Potts: It's interesting that this messaging \u2014 that there might be short-term pain but the long-term benefits would be worth it if Americans just hold on \u2014 didn't work for the Biden administration when it said prices had risen because of supply and demand shocks after the pandemic and that things were getting better.",
      "And Trump campaigned on lowering prices. The irony.",

      "The president is expected to sign an executive order directing McMahon to submit a proposal for diminishing the department, and then the president said she should \"put herself out of a job,\" even though such an action would require an act of Congress.",
      "Democratic senators have said they intend to scrutinize the nomination based on 76-year-old McMahon's lack of experience in public education.",
      "McMahon was interrupted by protesters during her opening statement, in which she defended her nomination and pushed for more school choice.",

      "The president has maintained that states should have control over their schools.",
      "However, abolishing the agency can only be done if Congress passes legislation to eliminate it. Experts say it is illegal to dismantle the department without congressional authorization, which would require 60 Senate votes in favor of doing so.",
      "HELP Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., and ranking member Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., both pressed McMahon on whether she believes dismantling the agency can be done without Congress. McMahon responded that only Congress would be able to do so.",
      "\"It is set up by the United States Congress, and we work with Congress. It clearly cannot be shut down without it,\" McMahon told Sanders.",
      "However, she told Cassidy she is \"all for the president's mission of returning education back to the states\" and said the states would still receive federal funding.",

We'd like to make sure that we are presenting a plan that I think our senators can get onboard with and our Congress would get on board with that would have a better-functioning Department of Education.

The president also praised McMahon's leadership and \"deep understanding\" of both education and business.",
      "McMahon's personal financial wealth is unclear, but she reported owning assets that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and that could surpass $1 billion. The Trump loyalist was co-chair of his presidential transition team and is a long-time donor who has given tens of millions of dollars to support pro-Trump causes.",
      "McMahon previously worked in the first Trump administration as head of the Small Business Administration. She had previously made two unsuccessful bids for Senate when she ran against current Senate Democrats Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy in 2010 and 2012, respectively. She is also chairwoman of the America First Policy Institute board but will leave that position if confirmed as secretary of education.",

    "story": [
      "States reported a sharp decline in abortions after Roe v. Wade was overruled.",
      "This is a KFF Health News story.",
      "In Arkansas, state health officials announced a stunning statistic for 2023: The total number of abortions in the state, where some 1.5 million women live, was zero.",
      "In South Dakota, too, official records show zero abortions that year.",
      "And in Idaho, home to abortion battles that have recently made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the official number of recorded abortions was just five.",
      "In nearly a dozen states with total or near-total abortion bans, government officials claimed that zero or very few abortions occurred in 2023, the first full year after the Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion rights.",
      "Those statistics, the most recent available and published in government records, have been celebrated by anti-abortion activists. Medical professionals say such accounts are not only untrue but fundamentally dishonest.",
      "\"To say there are no abortions going on in South Dakota is ludicrous,\" said Amy Kelley, an OB-GYN in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, citing female patients who have come to her hospital after taking abortion pills or to have medical procedures meant to prevent death or end nonviable pregnancies. \"I can think of five off the top of my head that I dealt with,\" she said, \"and I have 15 partners.\"",
      "For some data scientists, these statistics also suggest a troubling trend: the potential politicization of vital statistics.",
      "\"It's so clinically dishonest,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, who co-chairs WeCount, an academic research effort that has kept a tally of the number of abortions nationwide since April 2022.",
      "The zeroing out is statistically unlikely, Upadhyay said, and also runs counter to the reality that pregnancy \"comes with many risks and in many cases emergency abortion care will be needed.\"",
      "\"We know they are sometimes necessary to save the pregnant person's life,\" she said, \"so I do hope there are abortions occurring in South Dakota.\"",
      "State officials reported a sharp decline in the official number of abortions after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in June 2022.",

      "South Dakota, which had severely restricted abortions years ahead of the Dobbs ruling, reported zero in 2023 compared with 192 abortions in 2021.",
      "Anti-abortion politicians and activists have cited these statistics to bolster their claims that their decades-long crusade to end abortion is a success.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, many Arkansas pregnant mothers were spared from the lifelong regrets and physical complications abortion can cause and babies are alive today in Arkansas,\" Rose Mimms, executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, said in a press statement. \"That's a win-win for them and our state.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Health, Ashley Whitlow, said in an email that the department \"is not able to track abortions that take place out of the state or outside of a healthcare facility.\" State officials, she said, collect data from \"in-state providers and facilities for the Induced Abortion data reports as required by Arkansas law.\"",
      "WeCount's tallies of observed telehealth abortions do not appear in the official state numbers. For instance, from April to June 2024, it counted an average of 240 telehealth abortions a month in Arkansas.",
      "Groups that oppose abortion rights acknowledge that state surveillance reports do not tell the full story of abortion care occurring in their states. Mimms, of Arkansas Right to Life, said she would not expect abortions to be reported in the state, since the procedure is illegal except to prevent a patient's death.",
      "\"Women are still seeking out abortions in Arkansas, whether it's illegally or going out of state for illegal abortion,\" Mimms told KFF Health News. \"We're not naive.\"",
      "The South Dakota Department of Health \"compiles information it receives from health care organizations around the state and reports it accordingly,\" Tia Kafka, its marketing and outreach director, said in an email responding to questions about the statistics. Kafka declined to comment on specific questions about abortions being performed in the state or characterizations that South Dakota's report is flawed.",
      "Kim Floren, who serves as director of the Justice Empowerment Network, which provides funds and practical support to help South Dakota patients receive abortion care, expressed disbelief in the state's official figures.",
      "\"In 2023, we served over 500 patients,\" she said. \"Most of them were from South Dakota.\"",
      "\"For better or worse, government data is the official record,\" said Ishan Mehta, director for media and democracy at Common Cause, the nonpartisan public interest group. \"You are not just reporting data. You are feeding into an ecosystem that is going to have much larger ramifications.\"",
      "When there is a mismatch in the data reported by state governments and credible researchers, including WeCount and the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights, state researchers need to dig deeper, Mehta said.",
      "\"This is going to create a historical record for archivists and researchers and people who are going to look at the decades-long trend and try to understand how big public policy changes affected maternal health care,\" Mehta said. And now, the recordkeepers \"don't seem to be fully thinking through the ramifications of their actions.\"",
      "A culture of fear",
      "Abortion rights supporters agree that there has been a steep drop in the number of abortions in every state that enacted laws criminalizing abortion. In states with total bans, 63 clinics have stopped providing abortions. And doctors and medical providers face criminal charges for providing or assisting in abortion care in at least a dozen states.",
      "Practitioners find themselves working in a culture of confusion and fear, which could contribute to a hesitancy to report abortions -- despite some state efforts to make clear when abortion is allowed.",
      "For instance, South Dakota Department of Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt released a video to clarify when an abortion is legal under the state's strict ban.",
      "The procedure is legal in South Dakota only when a pregnant woman is facing death. Magstadt said doctors should use \"reasonable medical judgment\" and \"document their thought process.\"",
      "Any doctor convicted of performing an unlawful abortion faces up to two years in prison.",
      "In the place of reliable statistics, academic researchers at WeCount use symbols like dashes to indicate they can't accurately capture the reality on the ground.",
      "\"We try to make an effort to make clear that it's not zero. That's the approach these departments of health should take,\" said WeCount's Upadhyay, adding that health departments \"should acknowledge that abortions are happening in their states but they can't count them because they have created a culture of fear, a fear of lawsuits, having licenses revoked.\"",
      "\"Maybe that's what they should say,\" she said, \"instead of putting a zero in their reports.\"",
      "Mixed mandates for abortion data",
      "For decades, dozens of states have required abortion providers to collect detailed demographic information on the women who have abortions, including race, age, city, and county -- and, in some cases, marital status and the reason for ending the pregnancy.",
      "Researchers who compile data on abortion say there can be sound public health reasons for monitoring the statistics surrounding medical care, namely to evaluate the impact of policy changes. That has become particularly important in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs decision, which ended the federal right to an abortion and opened the door to laws in Republican-led states restricting and sometimes outlawing abortion care.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a Guttmacher data scientist, said data collection has been used by abortion opponents to overburden clinics with paperwork and force patients to answer intrusive questions. \"It's part of a pretty long history of those tools being used to stigmatize abortion,\" he said.",
      "In South Dakota, clinic staff members were required to report the weight of the contents of the uterus, including the woman's blood, a requirement that had no medical purpose and had the effect of exaggerating the weight of pregnancy tissue, said Floren, who worked at a clinic that provided abortion care before the state's ban.",
      "\"If it was a procedural abortion, you had to weigh everything that came out and write that down on the report,\" Floren said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not mandate abortion reporting, and some Democratic-led states, including California, do not require clinics or health care providers to collect data. Each year, the CDC requests abortion data from the central health agencies for every state, the District of Columbia, and New York City, and these states and jurisdictions voluntarily report aggregated data for inclusion in the CDC's annual \"Abortion Surveillance\" report.",
      "In states that mandate public abortion tracking, hospitals, clinics, and physicians report the number of abortions to state health departments in what are typically called \"induced termination of pregnancy\" reports, or ITOPs.",
      "Before Dobbs, such reports recorded procedural and medication abortions. But following the elimination of federal abortion rights, clinics shuttered in states with criminal abortion bans. More patients began accessing abortion medication through online organizations, including Aid Access, that do not fall under mandatory state reporting laws.",
      "At least six states have enacted what are called \"shield laws\" to protect providers who send pills to patients in states with abortion bans. That includes New York, where Linda Prine, a family physician employed by Aid Access, prescribes and sends abortion pills to patients across the country.",
      "Asked about states reporting zero or very few abortions in 2023, Prine said she was certain those statistics were wrong. Texas, for example, reported 50,783 abortions in the state in 2021. Now the state reports on average five a month. WeCount reported an average of 2,800 telehealth abortions a month in Texas from April to June 2024.",
      "\"In 2023, Aid Access absolutely mailed pills to all three states in question \u2014 South Dakota, Arkansas, and Texas,\" Prine said.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit in January against a New York-based physician, Maggie Carpenter, co-founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas patient in violation of Texas' near-total abortion ban. It's the first legal challenge to New York's shield law and threatens to derail access to medication abortion.",
      "Still, some state officials in states with abortion bans have sought to choke off the supply of medication that induces abortion. In May, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin wrote cease and desist letters to Aid Access in the Netherlands and Choices Women's Medical Center in New York City, stating that \"abortion pills may not legally be shipped to Arkansas\" and accusing the medical organizations of potentially \"false, deceptive, and unconscionable trade practices\" that carry up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "Good-government groups like Common Cause say that the dangers of officials relying on misleading statistics are myriad, including a disintegration of public trust as well as ill-informed legislation.",
      "These concerns have been heightened by misinformation surrounding health care, including an entrenched and vocal anti-vaccine movement and the objections of some conservative politicians to mandates related to COVID-19, including masks, physical distancing, and school and business closures.",
      "\"If the state is not going to put in a little more than the bare minimum to just find out if their data is accurate or not,\" Mehta said, \"we are in a very dangerous place.\"",

    "title": "RFK Jr. has questioned rising autism rates. Here's why experts say he's wrong",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:59:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned why autism rates have been rising over the last several years. Experts say he's missing nuance in these conversations.",
    "story": [
      "Currently, 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.",
      "During his confirmation hearings two weeks ago to lead the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. repeated several unfounded claims about autism.",
      "Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who has made money through books, speeches and lawsuits while sharing vaccine skepticism, refused to say that vaccines don't cause autism despite many high-quality studies finding no such link.",
      "He stated during the hearing that autism rates have \"have gone from 1 in 10,000 \u2026 and today in our children, it's one in 34.\" His claims have been repeated by President Donald Trump on Truth Social.",
      "It's unclear where Kennedy got his 1 in 10,000 statistic. In 2000, approximately 1 in 150 children in the U.S. born in 1992 were diagnosed with autism compared with 2020, during which one in 36 children born in 2012 were diagnosed, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Some psychiatrists and autism experts told ABC News it's important to highlight the rising rates of autism, and that at least Kennedy is putting a spotlight on it.",
      "\"On the bright side, I think it is really important to place an emphasis on these very high rates, it's kind of great putting a spotlight on autism, these increased rates,\" Dr. Karen Pierce, a professor in the department of neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego and co-director of the UCSD Autism Center of Excellence, told ABC News. \"We need more funding. We need more infrastructure to support everybody who is now recognized as on the spectrum. So, I think that that's actually a really good thing.\"",
      "However, the experts said Kennedy and others are missing important context about why autism rates are increasing. They say reasons may include a combination of widening of the definition of the spectrum and of types of symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as people having children at older ages, better awareness and access to diagnostic testing.",
      "\"With the rates increasing, there certainly are valid reasons for that,\" Pierce said. \"There's better awareness, and doctors can find autism a lot easier than they could before in the past\u2026. and I think a very big reason is just better record keeping nowadays and easier access to reviewing records.\"",
      "What is autism?",
      "ASD is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain, according to the CDC.",
      "People with ASD often communicate, interact, behave and learn differently, the CDC says. ASD symptoms typically begin before age 3 and can last a lifetime, although symptoms may change over time.",
      "\"There can be differences in how one is reading social cues and interpreting them, and then there's also certain behaviors that we see,\" Dr. Anna Krasno, clinical director of the Koegel Autism Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told ABC News.",
      "\"So those include a preference for sameness, a difficulty with transitioning, some cognitive and behavioral rigidity,\" she continued. \"We also see intense interests, so topics that people are super, super into and want to research, repetitive speech and motor movements. And then we also see really significant sensory differences as well.\"",
      "ASD is a spectrum, which means symptoms vary by person -- some need little support in their daily lives and some may need a great deal of support in performing day-to-day activities. Some may have advanced conversation skills and others may be nonverbal.",
      "Wider recognition, better understanding",
      "Experts told ABC News there is a wider recognition and a better understanding of what is now understood as autism/ASD.",
      "In the early 1900s, autism was described as a symptom of the most severe cases of schizophrenia, and it was considered a psychiatric disorder for many years.",
      "Traits of what is now known as ASD are built on early observations in the 1940s from Austrian-American psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner and Austrian physician Dr. Hans Asperger.",
      "A 1943 paper from Kanner described 11 children who presented with \"inborn autistic disturbances of affective contact\" while Asperger's 1944 report focused on boys who had marked social difficulties; unusual, circumscribed interests; and good verbal skills.",
      "It was not until 1978 that autism was recognized as a developmental disorder distinct from schizophrenia by the World Health Organization. It was also in the 1970s that psychologists and psychiatrists first came to describe autism as a spectrum.",
      "\"When autism was first described, it was new to people understanding that there was a condition that included social communication difficulties and restricted and repetitive behavior, and people primarily only recognized it when it was at its most extreme,\" Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele, division director in child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University, told ABC News.",
      "\"And so, if you go back and read the initial descriptions today, those are kids who we would recognize in the waiting room, recognize in the grocery store, in whom autism would be very obvious and would not require much assessment in order to diagnose,\" he continued.",
      "Better diagnostic tools",
      "Experts say another reason for the increase in rates is having better diagnostic tools than what was available decades ago.",
      "There is no single tool used as the basis of an ASD diagnosis. Typically, tools rely on descriptions from parents or caregivers of a child's development and a professional's observation of a child's behavior, according to the CDC.",
      "Currently, the Autism Society encourages all children to be screened for signs of autism by their family pediatrician three times by the age of three -- at nine, 18, and 24 or 30 months. If a child shows symptoms of ASD, more rigorous diagnostic testing can be carried out by a specialist including a full neuropsychological exam.",
      "Additionally, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) provides standard criteria for helping diagnose autism.",
      "Under DSM-5, a child meets the criteria if they have deficits in three areas of social communication and interaction and at least two of four types of restricted, repetitive behaviors.",
      "While the first edition of DSM came out in 1952, it was not until the third edition, DSM-3, in which autism was listed under an entirely new \"class\" of conditions -- the Pervasive Developmental Disorders.",
      "Veenstra-VanderWeele said the change in the criteria is another reason why the number of those diagnosed with autism rose. He likened it to changing the definition of what it means to be tall.",
      "\"To just use a crude example, if you would define somebody as tall if they were over six-foot-six, and then 30 years later, say that somebody is tall if they're over five-foot-10, you'd get very, very different numbers, and that's part of what's happened here,\" he said.",
      "Pierce added that because of limited knowledge and awareness in the past, there may have been many children who were underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed.",
      "\"It's understandable that people wouldn't even necessarily think that somebody has autism, because nobody knew what really autism was,\" she said. \"So, you know, large numbers of people were just put in the books as just having special education needs, maybe as a language delay or of having a cognitive impairment.\"",
      "Older reproductive age",
      "Some studies have suggested that people who become pregnant at an older age have an increased risk of giving birth to a child with autism.",
      "A 2012 review and meta-analysis of 16 papers from researchers in New York, London, Israel and Sweden found an association between advanced maternal age and the risk of autism.",
      "Advanced paternal age may also be a risk factor. A 2006 study conducted jointly by researchers in New York, London and Israel found that men who were above age 40 were 5.75 times more likely to have a child with ASD compared to men younger than age 30 after controlling for other factors.",
      "However, questions still swirl about whether or not there is a risk from the age of parents, and not all researchers are convinced.",
      "\"I know that there is some research looking at maternal and paternal age with regard to autism, and there's research around environmental causes,\" Krasno said. \"I think where I always firmly land is that it is inherited, and it is genetic. So, I don't know the exact correlation between age and diagnostic rate, but we do know that genetics are highly associated with diagnosis.\"",
      "Environmental risk factors",
      "Researchers are also divided over whether or not environmental risk factors play a role in causing autism.",
      "The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says the \"clearest evidence\" involves events before and during birth, including prenatal exposure to air pollution or pesticides; maternal obesity or diabetes; extreme prematurity; and periods of oxygen deprivation to the brain during birth.",
      "\"But these factors alone are unlikely to cause autism. Rather, they appear to increase a child's likelihood for developing autism when combined with genetic factors,\" NIEHS states on its website.",
      "Pierce said from the studies she's read, evidence suggests autism is a genetic condition. She added the environmental factors may play a role but \"to a small degree.\"",
      "Myth that vaccines cause autism",
      "The myth that vaccines cause autism was born out of a fraudulent 1998 study, hypothesizing that the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine caused intestinal inflammation, which, in turn, led to the development of autism.",
      "The paper has since been discredited by health experts, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license after an investigation found he had acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly\" in conducting his research.",
      "More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "However, Kennedy has held fast to this claim, saying during a 2023 interview on Fox News that he believes autism comes from vaccines.",
      "During the HHS confirmation hearings, Kennedy said he was not \"anti-vaccine\" but \"pro-safety.\" At the same time, Kennedy repeatedly refused throughout the hearings to say that vaccines were not linked to autism, while still insisting he supports vaccination in general.",
      "Experts told ABC News there is no evidence to suggest a link between vaccines and autism, and perpetuating the myth can be dangerous.",
      "\"Once there's a lie and it's spread, it doesn't matter that it's a lie. Once people hear it, then they believe that it's true despite all of the Herculean efforts to disprove it and debunk it,\" Pierce said. \"There's no evidence for it whatsoever, and there's actually extremely, as far as scientific evidence is concerned, there's extremely strong evidence to suggest absolutely not.\"",
      "Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America, said the false claim that vaccines cause autism can divert financial resources from much-needed research.",
      "\"Instead of advancing support and therapies, time and funding are wasted disproving a debunked theory,\" he said. \"This misinformation also fuels stigma, implying that autism is something to be feared rather than understood and supported, leading to discrimination against autistic individuals.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 09:04:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Shares of Elon Musk's Tesla electric car company have fallen sharply, leading some investors to wonder if the drop is related to his cost-cutting work in Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla's share price has fallen 30% since an all-time high in December.",
      "While Elon Musk has vaulted into a powerful role overhauling government agencies and upending Washington, the world's richest person has suffered a $106 billion drop in wealth due to steep decline in shares of his Tesla electric car company.",
      "Tesla's stock price has plummeted 30% from its all-time high in December, including a 21% selloff since Inauguration Day. The losses have sent Musk's net worth tumbling from a peak of $486 billion on Dec. 17 to its current level of about $380 billion, according to Bloomberg.",
      "The stock woes have divided current and former Tesla shareholders. Critics of Musk fault his new role and polarizing reputation, blaming recent reports showing lackluster sales in some regions on his foray into politics. They say Musk must step away from the Trump administration for the company to thrive.",
      "Supporters, on the other hand, say Musk's role in the White House has little to do with the selloff, noting that Tesla shares remain higher than where they stood on Election Day. Instead, some say, the company is suffering growing pains as it weathers stiff competition in electric vehicles and pursues new ventures like self-driving taxis.",
      "\"I don't have a problem if Elon wants to save a bunch of money for America. I say, 'Where's the good part in this for Tesla?'\" Ross Gerber, a prominent Tesla investor, told ABC News, referring to cost-cutting efforts undertaken by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Tesla representatives did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Despite disagreement over the effect of Musk's government role, both current and former Tesla shareholders who spoke to ABC News broadly acknowledged the company's recent business hiccups.",
      "Tesla sold fewer cars in 2024 than it did the year prior, marking the company's first year-over-year sales decline in more than a decade, earnings released in January showed.",
      "As rivals have challenged Tesla's dominance over the electric vehicle market, the company has promised a future revenue stream from autonomous taxis, also known as robotaxis.",
      "Musk announced in late January that the company would roll out its robotaxi test program in Austin, Texas, in June. But within days, China-based competitor BYD unveiled advances in self-driving technology, which the company said was set to be included in models costing as little as $9,600.",
      "Gary Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, which manages $100 million in assets, including Tesla shares, said the recent selloff of Tesla is primarily the result of investor jitters about whether the company can dominate self-driving technology the way it did electric vehicles.",
      "\"Over time, you will see Teslas and other cars self-drive. But Tesla is not going to be the only one,\" Black told ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze.",
      "The stock also faced downward pressure this week when a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, making possible a scenario in which Musk would sell some of his Tesla shares to finance the deal, Black said.",
      "Black said that, in his opinion, the downturn has nothing to do with Musk's government role.",
      "\"It's always good to know the president of the United States -- to be able to pick up your phone and say, you know, 'I need this favor, that favor,'\" Black said.",
      "A jump in Tesla shares after Trump's victory suggests many investors viewed the relationship that way. The stock price soared about 85% over a six-week period following Election Day.",
      "But some investors lay the blame for the downturn squarely at Musk's feet.",
      "Nell Minow, Vice Chair of ValueEdge Advisors and a longtime critic of Musk, said Musk has been \"absent\" from the company.",
      "\"I think that he is a huge drag on the stock right now,\" Minow told Schulze. \"No question, he's a problem.\"",
      "\"Elon Musk is to the Tesla brand what the Green Giant is to corn,\" Minow said. \"He has made himself the brand and that is always very risky.\"",
      "Minow, who said she donated nearly all of her Tesla shares to charity last year, also criticized the Tesla board for what she said was a failure to hold Musk to account, or update shareholders and the public about a leadership plan while Musk runs DOGE.",
      "\"We don't know what the board is thinking. They have not spoken out in any way,\" Minow said. \"They have not made a filing with the SEC about what the impact of this side hustle is, and the employees and the shareholders need some kind of certainty.\"",
      "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed concerns about the board's ability to rein in Musk. Lander, who oversees $1.25 billion in Tesla stock through the city's five pension systems, said the lack of oversight was a \"long-standing problem.\"",
      "\"Independent governance is designed to provide a voice for shareholders at the table,\" Lander, who is running for New York City mayor and has publicly sparred with Musk, said in a statement to ABC News. \"When companies are controlled by a set of directors with either family or aligned interests, they lose this.\"",
      "For his part, Musk has looked to hype up Tesla's prospects, saying on an earnings call last month that he believes there is an opportunity for it to be \"the most valuable company in the world.\"",
      "During the call, AllianceBernstein Research analyst Daniel Roska questioned Musk on how Tesla plans to meet its ambitious projections given its high valuation.",
      "Musk emphasized Tesla's focus on real-world AI, claiming the company is making significant strides.",
      "\"We're working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month over month,\" Musk said. \"I go where the problem is, essentially ... I focus where the challenges are the greatest.\"",
      "Some Tesla shareholders remain bullish on the company despite its short-term drop. Angel investor Larry Goldberg, known as \"Tesla Larry,\" posted on X that he supports Musk's political efforts, even if they impact the company's stock price.",
      "\"If the Trump administration (and DOGE) does not fix the deficit, my Tesla shares -- and everyone's US stocks and bonds will be worthless,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Musk reposted Goldberg's comment, adding, \"Exactly.\"",

      "The State Department instructed United States embassies around the world to start planning for staff reductions on Wednesday, sources told ABC News.",
      "Senior embassy officials were asked to provide comprehensive lists of all employees and their employment status as part of the process, sources said, explaining that the request includes tenured, untenured and temporary duty assignments.",
      "Embassies will be required to cut both American staff and employees hired from the location in which the embassy is based, sources added.",
      "The State Department communication went out shortly before President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday afternoon that compelled State Department staff to comply with his administration\u2019s foreign policy goals -- while making it easier to discipline them if they don\u2019t.",
      "Titled \"ONE VOICE FOR AMERICA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS,\" the order said that the secretary of state \"must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots\" in order to effectively uphold foreign policy initiatives.",
      "That involves the ability to \"reform the Foreign Service\" through not only staffing revisions but also changes to collateral. It specifies revamping the set of policies and procedures that control almost every element of the State Department\u2019s work and U.S. diplomatic presence abroad: the Foreign Affairs Manual and the Foreign Affairs Handbooks.",
      "The full scope of the executive order\u2019s implications will depend on the steps taken after its signing, but it could pave the way for a massive restructuring of the State Department that consolidates power under political appointees that are hand-selected by the president.",
      "Such changes could empower the State Department to strip benefits from members of the foreign service stationed abroad, like security protections and annual paid travel to visit family members. They could impact virtually every element of the federal employees' day-to-day jobs, from the handling of classified information to dealing with conflicts of interest.",
      "Taken to the extreme, the order could also pave the way for shrinking the U.S. diplomatic footprint abroad \u2014 prompting the State Department to rethink the presence of U.S. embassies in certain countries altogether.",
      "The department might reconsider membership in some international organizations or withdraw from existing diplomatic agreements.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to face legal challenges over the order, but the law that codifies the administration of the foreign service is fairly deferential to the secretary of state.",
      "In the past two weeks, an overwhelming majority of U.S. Agency for International Development employees who were embedded in embassies have already been put on administrative leave.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas man who murdered his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled into death row to threaten a lawmaker, was scheduled to be executed Thursday.",
      "Richard Lee Tabler, 46, would be the second inmate executed in Texas in a little over a week, with two more scheduled by the end of April. He's set to receive a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "Tabler was condemned for the Thanksgiving 2004 shooting deaths of Mohammed-Amine Rahmouni, 28, and Haitham Zayed, 25, in a remote area near Killeen in Central Texas. Rahmouni was the manager of a strip club where Tabler worked until he was banned from the place. Zayed was a friend of Rahmouni, and police said both men were killed in a late-night meeting to buy some stolen stereo equipment that was actually a planned ambush.",
      "Tabler also confessed to killing two teenage girls who worked at the club, Tiffany Dotson, 18, and Amanda Benefield, 16. He was indicted but never tried in their killings.",
      "Tabler has repeatedly asked the courts that his appeals be dropped and that he be put to death. He also has changed his mind on that point several times, and his attorneys have questioned whether he is mentally competent to make that decision. Tabler\u2019s prison record includes at least two instances of attempted suicide, and he was previously granted a stay of execution in 2010.",
      "\u201cPetitioner has spent the last twenty years in the Courts, and see's no point in wasting this Courts time, nor anyone else's,\u201d Tabler wrote to the state Court of Criminal Appeals on Dec. 9, 2024, after his current execution date was set.",
      "Tabler's death row phone calls in 2008 to state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston, prompted an unprecedented lockdown of more than 150,000 inmates in the the nation's second-largest prison system. Some were confined to their cells for weeks while officers swept more than 100 prisons to seize hundreds of items of contraband, including cellphones.",
      "Whitmire led a Senate committee with oversight of state prisons, and said at the time that Tabler warned him that he knew the names of his children and where they lived. Whitmire, through a spokesperson at the mayor's office, declined to comment on Tabler's pending execution.",
      "The ACLU appealed Tabler\u2019s case to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, claiming he was denied adequate legal representation during his lower court appeals by attorneys who refused to participate in hearings at what they said was his request.",
      "The ACLU appeal argued that Tabler's attorneys ignored a psychological exam that determined he had a \u201cdeep and severe constellation of mental illnesses\u201d that had been ignored since childhood. The court refused to halt his execution.",
      "Tabler worked at a bar called TeaZers and investigators said he had a conflict with his boss, Rahmouni, who allegedly said he could have Tabler's family \u201cwiped out\u201d for $10.",
      "Tabler recruited a friend, a soldier at nearby Fort Cavazos, and lured Rahmouni and Zayed to a meeting. Tabler shot them both in their car, then pulled Rahmouni out and had the friend record a video of him shooting Rahmouni again.",
      "Tabler later confessed to the killings. During the sentencing phase of his trial, prosecutors introduced Tabler's written and videotaped statements that he also killed Dotson and Benefield days later because he was worried they would tell people he killed the men.",
      "Investigators said that before he was arrested, Tabler called the Bell County Sheriff's Office to taunt deputies about the murders, and threatened to kill more strip club employees and undercover law enforcement at the club.",

      "A New Hampshire town and a bakery owner are scheduled for trial in a First Amendment dispute about a painting of a sun and pastries",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- A First Amendment dispute over a bright painting that shows sunbeams shining down on a mountain range made of sprinkle-covered chocolate and strawberry doughnuts, a blueberry muffin, a cinnamon roll and other pastries is scheduled for trial Thursday.",
      "A federal judge in New Hampshire will consider whether a town is infringing on the free speech rights of the bakery owner who's displaying the mural over his business.",
      "\u201cI think the whole town is following this story,\u201d said Sean Young, the owner of Leavitt's Country Bakery in Conway, a community of more than 10,000 people near the White Mountains that draws skiers, nature lovers and shoppers. Some residents want regulations enforced as they worry about overdevelopment in the tourist town.",
      "The mural atop the bakery, which was founded over 45 years ago, is a creation of local high school art students. When it went up in June 2022, the painting attracted a lot of compliments and visitors, including one from a town zoning officer.",
      "The zoning board decided that the painting was not so much art as advertising. The board determined it was a sign, and so it could not remain as is because of its size. At about 90 square feet (8.6 square meters), it\u2019s four times bigger than the local sign code allows.",
      "If the painting didn't show what's sold inside \u2014 baked goods \u2014 it wouldn't be considered a sign and could stay, board members said.",
      "Lawyers for the town say that it has shown that \u201crestricting the size of signs serves the significant government interest of preserving the town\u2019s aesthetics, promoting safety, and ensuring equal enforcement,\u201d according to a court document.",
      "Young was told to modify or remove the painting. Faced with possible misdemeanor criminal charges and fines after his appeals were rejected, he sued the town in federal court in 2023, saying his freedom of speech rights were violated.",
      "\u201cGovernment officials don\u2019t get to tell people, including entrepreneurs and businesses, what they can and can\u2019t paint,\u201d the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, which is representing Young, said in a news release at the time. \"And no one can say with a straight face that Leavitt\u2019s mural would be any safer, healthier or more aesthetically pleasing if it portrayed flowers instead of pastries.\u201d",
      "Young is asking for $1 in damages. His lawyers say the town's definition of a sign is overly broad and that the town hasn't shown that anything bad will happen if the painting continues to stay up. It hasn't been removed.",
      "Part of Conway's sign code states that the town \"has no intention of restricting individual free speech, but the town does recognize its right to place reasonable restrictions upon commercial speech.\u201d",
      "The town has enforced its sign code against other businesses. In 2006, for example, it said an ice cream parlor's trash cans, which were shaped like ice cream cones, were signs. The business asked for and got permission from the town to use the cans. In another case, a sporting goods store agreed to remove window screens with photos of mountain bikes and skis after the town determined they were signs.",
      "Young's lawsuit was paused for a few months in 2023 as residents considered revising how the town defines signs, in a way that would have allowed the painting to stay up. But that measure was seen as too broad and complex, and it failed to pass.",
      "Last year, voters passed a new ordinance that requires applicants to meet criteria for art on public and commercial property but it has not applied to Young's case."

      "The lawsuit describes the law as \u201ca frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\" It highlights a provision that requires the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information. The Justice Department is asking the court to strike down the law.",
      "\u201cThis is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,\u201d said Bondi, with agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration lined up behind her. \u201cMillions of illegal aliens with violent records have flooded into our communities, bringing violence and deadly drugs with them.\u201d",
      "Bondi\u2019s politically charged rhetoric, unusual for an institution that has historically been wary of aligning itself so directly with the White House, and the selection of legal targets raise fresh concerns that she could seek to use the agency\u2019s law enforcement powers to go after the president\u2019s adversaries. James, the New York attorney general, has drawn Trump\u2019s ire by suing him, leading to a civil fraud judgment that stands to cost Trump nearly $500 million.",
      "James said in a statement that she's prepared to defend the state's laws, which she said \u201cprotect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe.\u201d",
      "Hochul said New York welcomes \u201claw-abiding individuals who want to work, pay taxes and contribute to our communities, while at the same time protecting the public safety of all New Yorkers by cracking down on violent criminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe expect Pam Bondi\u2019s worthless, publicity-driven lawsuit to be a total failure, just like all the others. Let me be clear: New York is not backing down,\u201d the governor said in a statement.",
      "Bondi appeared alongside Tammy Nobles, whose 20-year-old daughter Kayla was killed in Aberdeen, Maryland, in July 2022 by someone from El Salvador who entered the country illegally months earlier in Texas. The assailant, then 16, was released to a first cousin to pursue asylum, which is common practice under U.S. law and policy. He had been accused by authorities in El Salvador of affiliation with the violent MS-13 gang, according to a report by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "To trumpet his immigration policies, Trump has often highlighted \u201cangel moms\u201d like Nobles, who lost their loved ones to violent crimes by people in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cTammy represents not only herself and her family but all of the great angel moms around this country who have suffered because of what the Biden administration did,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s over.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes days after the Justice Department sued the city of Chicago, alleging that its \u201c sanctuary\u201d laws were thwarting federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration sought to pressure New York into changing its law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.",
      "New York\u2019s governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn\u2019t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residency in the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration ultimately restored New Yorkers\u2019 access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.",

      "In 2023, the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, the Immigrant Development Center and the center's executive director sued Patriot Front, two of its leaders and 10 unidentified others, alleging they violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, among other claims. The plaintiffs sought unspecified damages to be determined at trial, along with other requested relief.",

    "story": [
      "When the Illinois Department of Corrections shut down the century-old Stateville Correctional Center in September, officials transferred 278 inmates convicted of murder and dozens more serving time for violent crimes to other lockups across the state",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Among the approximately 400 inmates transferred when Illinois' decrepit Stateville prison closed over the summer, 278 were convicted of murder and 100 more are serving time for other violent offenses.",
      "Yet, nearly four in five of the offenders formerly housed at the suburban Chicago lockup were not shipped to top-level maximum-security prisons, where the toughest criminals, troublemakers and escape risks are housed. Instead, they went to mid-level medium-security facilities, according to an Associated Press analysis of Illinois Department of Corrections data.",
      "Prison employees believe housing for the transferred inmates was based on which facilities had bed space and sufficient personnel who are adequately trained in a critically understaffed system.",
      "Corrections spokesperson Naomi Puzzello said all of the transfers from Stateville are appropriately housed and that none was reclassified to a lower security level to match that of the receiving prison. She acknowledged scores of maximum-security beds are vacant but said corrections' understaffing played no role in the transfers.",
      "However, the AP obtained minutes from a meeting at a separate facility nearly a year before Stateville's shutdown in which administrators discouraged staff from bumping troublemakers up to a higher risk level because \u201cmaximum security beds are in short supply.\u201d",
      "And the AP found that in more than half of the relocations, ex-Stateville inmates were transferred without regard to a corrections guideline that those serving sentences of 30 years or more be housed in max prisons.",
      "Opened in 1925, Stateville was targeted for closure in the spring when Gov. JB Pritzker set aside $900 million to replace it and Logan Correctional Center, the deteriorating women\u2019s facility in central Illinois. A federal judge, accelerating the plan by declaring Stateville uninhabitable and inaccessible, ordered it shuttered by Sept. 30.",
      "Prison staff shortages are a problem nationally. Wisconsin has seen a spate of inmate deaths while it struggles with vacant posts. \u201cGrossly inadequate\u201d staffing was among problems listed last fall in a searing Justice Department critique of violence, drugs and sexual abuse in Georgia prisons.",
      "Data compiled by the nonprofit Safer Prisons, Safer Communities shows that the number of state-employed corrections officers dropped from 237,000 in 2012 to 182,000 in 2023.",
      "Simply put, it's a tough job, said Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and advocacy group that espouses decarceration.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to witness violence, you might witness serious mental illness,\" Bertram said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be around a lot of drug use and these things have a measurable impact on corrections workers.\u201d",
      "The Illinois Department of Corrections is 396 frontline security officers short of what was budgeted, according to October department staffing numbers. Total current officers are more than 2,800 shy of the authorized headcount, or the number needed to operate without substantial overtime.",
      "Under the Illinois public records law, AP obtained a list of 406 inmates housed at Stateville as of August 2024 and matched each with the prison to which they\u2019d been transferred, noting its security level. Corrections denied a request for the accompanying pre-transfer security levels of each inmate.",
      "Statewide, there are 1,750 currently unoccupied beds in max prisons, Puzzello said. However, the majority are in cells designed for two inmates and most prisoners are in single-occupancy cells, so short staffing isn't to blame, she maintained. The agency continues to vigorously recruit security cadets.",
      "Employees are unconvinced and believe some inmates who qualify for max security have been diverted to less secure places, posing a risk to inmates as well as staff.",
      "Although not part of the latest transfers, an offender moved to Sheridan Correctional Center in north-central Illinois from Stateville in November 2023 viciously attacked a prison educator, who required facial reconstruction surgery, according to the employees' union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31.",
      "There have been at least two suspected homicides of inmates since mid-2024, but corrections denied the AP's public records request for information on them. The news agency is appealing that decision.",
      "High-security bed space appears to have been an issue months before Stateville's shutdown. In minutes obtained by the AP from a December 2023 management meeting at Dixon Correctional Center in northern Illinois, administrators advised staff to \u201cuse good judgment\u201d before upgrading a troublemaker's risk level to maximum, necessitating a transfer.",
      "\u201cMaximum security beds throughout the state are in short supply,\" the minutes say. \"If we try to transfer all the max security individuals, they will more than likely just end up at another medium security facility.\u201d",
      "Puzzello reiterated that none of the Stateville transfers had security downgrades. She said transfers are based not only on criminal background but on programming needs, medical and mental health treatment and staffing ratios at the receiving facility.",
      "\u201cThis ensures each individual\u2019s classification is appropriate and tailored to their specific risk factors, behaviors and needs, supporting a safe and secure correctional environment,\" Puzzello said.",
      "However, a general corrections guideline is that any offender serving a sentence of 30 or more years be housed in a maximum-security cell. Those with 10 to 30 years go to medium, according to the guideline.",
      "Of ex-Stateville inmates, 261 \u2014 or 64% \u2014 locked up for 30 or more years are now sitting in medium-security prisons, according to the AP review.",
      "AFSCME spokesperson Anders Lindall said prison counselors who evaluated each inmate for an appropriate transfer location believed management had already decided where each would go. Puzzello denied that happened.",
      "Lindall said the union received reports of \u201congoing instances of recommendations made at the facility level -- by employees whose job it is to evaluate, classify and place the offenders who they know best \u2014 being overruled by departmental management.\u201d"

      "Shapiro, a Democrat, filed the lawsuit despite the fact that federal courts have repeatedly rejected the Trump administration's sweeping pause on federal funding, and Shapiro's lawyers suggest that the Trump administration is continuing to ignore court orders to restore access to the suspended money.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, calls actions by the federal agencies \u201cflagrantly lawless\u201d and said the agencies have no legal authority to unilaterally refuse to spend congressionally appropriated money over a policy disagreement.",
      "Further, the agencies have provided no plausible explanation for the suspension, Shapiro's lawyers said.",
      "Shapiro, his agencies and members of Congress have tried to try to fully restore access to the money, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cDespite that work, and despite two temporary restraining orders requiring federal agencies to restore access to suspended funds, federal agencies continue to deny Pennsylvania agencies funding that they are entitled to receive,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The federal agencies named as defendants \u2014 the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy, Interior and Transportation \u2014 did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. In the Department of Interior's case, it said its policy is not to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The Trump administration issued a memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans. Administration officials said the pause was necessary to review whether spending aligned with Trump\u2019s executive orders on issues such as climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The freeze caused widespread chaos.",
      "The Trump administration rescinded the memo less than two days later, but money for things such as early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research remained tied up, nearly two dozen Democratic states said in a federal lawsuit.",
      "A judge ordered the administration on Monday to \u201cimmediately take every step necessary\u201d to unfreeze all federal grants and loans, finding that the Trump administration hadn't fully followed his earlier order. The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling and lost Tuesday.",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s case, the Shapiro administration said about $2.5 billion in grants or reimbursements committed to Pennsylvania is now suspended or under some sort of review that hasn\u2019t been approved by Congress or any funding agreement, and hasn\u2019t been explained to Shapiro\u2019s administration.",
      "The lawsuit said aid is being withheld from programs that distribute money to plug abandoned gas wells, improve energy efficiency in homes, upgrade rural electric service and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Shapiro's lawyers said the administration cannot legally add new conditions to federal aid after a state has already accepted it, and federal aid cannot be shut off unless it is for a reason that is specifically laid out by the law or a funding agreement between a state and federal agency.",
      "That violates the spending clause of the U.S. Constitution, Shapiro's lawsuit said.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- President Donald Trump's administration is holding up money for wildfire mitigation projects funded through legislation championed by his Democratic predecessor, threatening efforts to prevent catastrophic blazes like the ones that recently ripped through Southern California.",
      "The decision undermines Trump's repeated insistence that communities need to clear combustible materials like fallen branches and undergrowth \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s called management of the floor,\u201d he said while visiting Los Angeles last month \u2014 to guard against wildfires.",
      "Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the Interior Department, said via email that mitigation work is \u201ccurrently undergoing review to ensure consistency\u201d with Trump\u2019s executive orders.",
      "The scrutiny is being applied only to projects using money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, two centerpieces of former President Joe Biden's administration. They included roughly $3 billion for wildfire mitigation efforts, often known as hazardous fuels reduction programs.",
      "Peace said those programs are continuing if funded by other congressional appropriations.",
      "Lomakatsi Restoration Project, a forest management nonprofit that develops and implements programs to reduce hazardous fuels and wildfire threat in Oregon, northern California and Idaho, has stopped work on projects funded by Biden's legislation, which provides 65% of its $17 million budget.",
      "Executive director Marko Bey said he laid off 15 full-time employees after being told by federal officials the funding was frozen pending review, with no information on when it would be released.",

      "Mitigation work, which includes removing small and dead trees with logging equipment or through controlled burns, can prevent forests from becoming tinderboxes. It often takes place in winter and spring in preparation for warmer months when fires can be more severe. Wildfire season traditionally starts in May and ends in November, though blazes can occur year-round because of warmer, drier conditions exacerbated by climate change.",
      "The latest example came last month in the Los Angeles area, where fires killed at least 29 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures in what is projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.",
      "Trump has talked about forest management since his first term, when he visited California after the Camp Fire killed 85 people in 2018.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take care of the floors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the floors of the forest, very important.\u201d In Finland, he said, \u201cthey spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things.\u201d",
      "He issued an executive order intended to improve management of federal lands, and in 2020 he complained about California officials.",

      "Fields also said that \"there has been no bigger advocate for restoring California to its natural beauty than President Trump, which is why he made it a point to visit the region in his first week in office and he\u2019s continuing to put tremendous pressure on state and local government to reduce the barriers in restoring the area.\u201d",
      "The review ordered by Trump is also disrupting a $1 billion grant program that helps local jurisdictions better prepare for fires through neighborhood risk assessments and community outreach programs.",

      "Applicants whom McLane has selected for his crew have received some of the information they need to complete \u2014 such as medical and drug tests and fingerprinting \u2014 in order to be officially hired. But the process has not been completed because human resources lacks agency permission to move forward, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very confused, and we\u2019re not being told anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whose job it is to say that firefighters are an essential aspect for public safety and are exempt from the hiring freeze. But whoever\u2019s job it is, they need to say it, because if they don\u2019t, then there will be situations where people call 911 and there aren\u2019t enough firefighters to go around.\u201d",
      "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allowed for some small increases to the 18,700 federal firefighters in 2022, but issues with workforce understaffing and retention remain. The attrition rate for firefighters at the U.S. Forest Service has been 45% over the past four years, a group of Democratic senators said in a second letter to the administration this week.",

      "Democrats have been gearing up to grill McMahon on her willingness to execute Trump\u2019s plan, which opponents say would undermine public education. Trump hasn\u2019t said whether he would preserve the core work of the agency, which sends billions of dollars a year to schools, manages a $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and enforces civil rights in education.",
      "In a letter to McMahon this week, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim said she\u2019ll be asked if she supports Trump\u2019s plan, and what action she will take to carry it out. It asks McMahon for commitments to preserve the department\u2019s student loan operations and civil rights office, among other programs highlighted by the Democrats.",

The 19-year-old was last seen on July 31 at her home on Schofield Barracks, an Army installation on Oahu, when she was six months pregnant. She is presumed dead, the Army said.",
      "The Army said the \u201cgeneral nature of the charges\u201d are for the killing of his wife, intentionally killing her unborn child and obstruction of justice. Other charges involve providing false official statements, possession of child sexual abuse images and the production and distribution of child sexual abuse images, the Army said.",
      "The Army took Johnson into custody in August. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he had a civilian attorney. A phone number listed for him rang unanswered Wednesday.",
      "Johnson, from Frederick, Maryland, is a calvary scout. He enlisted in the Army and attended training at Fort Moore, Georgia, in November 2022. He was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division in 2023.",
      "Johnson's case will be assigned to a military judge who will schedule dates for an arraignment, pretrial hearings and a trial, the Army said. Charging documents will be available after Johnson is arraigned, according to a spokesperson for the Army Office of Special Trial Counsel.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale prices came in hotter than expected last month at a time when progress against inflation appears to have stalled, undercutting expectations for lower interest rates this year.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers \u2014 rose 0.4% from December and 3.5% from January 2024. Forecasters had expected a 0.2% change month over month and 3.2% year over year.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices rose 0.3% last month from December and 3.6% from a year earlier.",
      "Wholesale services prices rose 0.3%, pushed higher by increasing hotel costs. Goods services climbed 0.6% on higher energy prices.",
      "The wholesale price report arrived a day after the Labor Department delivered some bad news about inflation at the consumer level. Its consumer price index rose 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 2.9% year-over-year increase in December.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation flared up in early 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, overwhelming factories, ports and freight yards and leading to shortages, delays and higher prices.",
      "In response, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate \u2014 the fed funds rate \u2014 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation began tumbling \u2014 from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022 to a low of 2.4% in September, tantalizingly close to the central bank's 2% target. The Fed was satisfied enough to reverse course and cut its rate three times in the last four months of 2024.",
      "Then the improvement on inflation stopped. Year-over-year consumer price inflation has now risen for four straight months.",
      "And economists and financial markets are worried that President Donald Trump's policies will push inflation higher yet. His tariffs on foreign goods and plans to deport millions of undocumented workers could translate into higher prices.",
      "In response to stubborn inflation, the Fed may hold off on further rate cuts. Back in December, it signaled that it expected to cut two more times in 2025. That seems far less likely now. Wall Street investors anticipate only rate cut this year and don't expect that one until October."

      "In a major reversal, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency says he'll try to rescind $20 billion in grants awarded by the Biden administration for climate and clean-energy projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a major reversal, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency said he will try to rescind $20 billion in grants awarded by the Biden administration for climate and clean-energy projects.",
      "In a video posted on X, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for a still-emerging \u201cgreen bank\u201d that is set to fund tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice.",
      "The program, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but is more commonly called the green bank. Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.",
      "The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently cited it as one of his major accomplishments.",
      "Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"",
      "The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.",
      "Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.",
      "\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d",
      "The money has already been awarded to eight nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organizations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation.",

      "A Florida man convicted of murdering a husband and wife while the couple's toddler looked on is set to be executed Thursday evening",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- A Florida man convicted of murdering a husband and wife during a fishing trip at a remote farm while the couple's toddler looked on is scheduled to receive a lethal injection Thursday in the state's first execution this year.",
      "The execution of 64-year-old James Dennis Ford is set for 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison under a death warrant signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January. It is the first execution scheduled in Florida this year after one execution in the state in 2024 and six in 2023.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court denied Ford's final appeal Wednesday without comment.",
      "Ford was convicted by a jury of murdering Gregory Malnory, 25, and 26-year-old Kimberly Malnory during a fishing outing in 1997 at a remote sod farm in southwest Florida. Ford and Gregory Malnory were coworkers at the Charlotte County farm, court records show.",
      "The couple's 22-month-old daughter witnessed the killings while strapped in a seat in the family's open pickup truck. She survived an 18-hour ordeal before the crime scene was discovered by workers. Investigators said she was found covered in her mother's blood and suffering from numerous mosquito and other insect bites.",
      "Court documents say Ford attacked Gregory Malnory after the group arrived to go fishing, shooting him in the head with a .22-caliber rifle, beating him with an axe-like blunt instrument and finally slitting his throat. Kimberly Malnory was beaten, raped and then shot with the same rifle, authorities say.",
      "Ford initially told investigators that the Malnorys were alive when he left them to go hunting, suggesting someone else killed them. Prosecutors said in a court filing that there was \u201coverwhelming proof that Ford was responsible for the murders and the rape.\u201d",
      "The rifle was found later in a ditch near where Ford's truck had run out of gas and prosecutors presented DNA evidence at his trial connecting him to both slayings. The jury voted 11-1 to recommend the death penalty in the killings, to which the trial judge agreed.",
      "Ford's lawyers have filed numerous appeals since his sentence was imposed, none successful. Most recently the Florida Supreme Court rejected claims that his IQ of about 65 at the time of the murders put him in an intellectually disabled category with a mental age then of about 14 \u2014 therefore ineligible for execution, court documents show.",
      "The court noted that only defendants whose chronological age was under 18 at the time of a crime can be ineligible for the death penalty \u201cand because Ford was 36 at the time of the murders, it is impossible for him to demonstrate that he falls within the ages of exemption.\u201d",
      "It's not clear from court records why these killings happened. Part of Ford's defense was that he suffered from abuse as a child and became an alcoholic like his father, drinking about a case of beer a day along with liquor. He also suffered from untreated diabetes, sometimes leading to blackouts and erratic behavior.",
      "Besides the death penalty, Ford was also convicted of sexual battery with a firearm and child abuse.",
      "If carried out as scheduled, Ford\u2019s execution would be the first in Florida in 2025. One person was put to death in 2024, down from six in 2023, when DeSantis was campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination. During the previous three years, the governor didn\u2019t sign off on any executions.",
      "The Death Penalty Information Center said Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 21:54:40 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced legal action against New York officials over a 2019 state law allowing immigrants to obtain state-issued driver&rsquo;s license regardless of legal status",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced legal action against New York officials over a 2019 state law allowing immigrants to obtain state-issued driver\u2019s license regardless of legal status",
      "While U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced legal action Wednesday against New York officials over a 2019 state law allowing immigrants to obtain state-issued driver's licenses regardless of legal status, the Empire State isn't alone in having such a mandate on the books.",
      "At least 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted similar laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. They're often called \u201cGreen Light\u201d or \u201cDrive Only License\u201d laws and some have been in effect for decades.",
      "The details of these laws can differ by state, including whether a driver's information can be shared with federal authorities - a key sticking point for Bondi, who called New York's law a \u201cgreen light to illegal immigration.\u201d",
      "Here's what you need to know about these special licenses:",
      "As part of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration campaign promises, Bondi announced at her first news conference the federal government planned to sue New York Attorney General Letitia James and Gov. Kathy Hochul over the state's Green Light Law. While the legislation was enacted in part to help improve public safety on the roads and make it easier for the immigrant drivers to get insurance, there's a provision Bondi said requires the state's motor vehicles commissioner to inform license-holders when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tipping off an illegal alien and it\u2019s unconstitutional.\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we filed this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "Besides New York, other states with drive-only laws include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, which has the oldest one. It dates back to 1993 and allows people without Social Security numbers to provide alternative documentation to show proof of residence, such as a utility bill or a tax identification number.",
      "Minnesota has one of the most recent laws. In 2023, requirements for applicants to show a legal presence were removed, affecting an estimated 81,000 people. While they're not asked for proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent residence status, applicants must provide identifying documents such as an unexpired foreign passport or a certified birth certificate issued by a foreign jurisdiction.",
      "Under the state law, Minnesota Department of Public Safety officials do not submit the names or personal information of applicants to any immigration law enforcement.",
      "No. While the drive-only license-holders are typically tested on whether they understand the rules of the road, their license can't be used for federal and sometimes state identification purposes, or to vote. In Connecticut, for example, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles makes it clear on its website the license are only to be used for driving purposes and registering a motor vehicle.",
      "Some conservatives have argued that drive-only licenses will encourage illegal immigration while others question whether they could lead to voter fraud in some states.",
      "Former Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, vetoed a bill in 2022 that allowed immigrants without legal status to obtain a state driver's license \u201cbecause it requires the Registry of Motor Vehicles to issue state credentials to people without the ability to verify their identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsequently, a standard Massachusetts driver\u2019s license will no longer confirm that a person is who they say they are,\u201d he added in a letter to lawmakers.",
      "The legislature overrode Baker's veto. Later that year, in a midterm election, voters agreed to uphold the measure in a statewide ballot measure."

      "Christianity is by far the largest faith in America, and Christian conservatives have a strong grip on the levers of government",
      "Christianity is by far the largest faith in America, and Christian conservatives have a strong grip on the levers of government. That dominance is leaving many to question why President Donald Trump\u2019s new task force on eradicating anti-Christian bias is needed.",
      "Critics see the task force initiative as unnecessary and pandering to Trump\u2019s base. But some Christian supporters said it is overdue, claiming the Biden administration had discriminated against them through actions and inactions.",
      "The two-year task force, chaired by Attorney General Pam Bondi and composed of Cabinet and other government representatives, is assigned to review and \u201cidentify any unlawful anti-Christian\u201d actions under the Biden administration, change any objectionable policies and recommend steps to rectify any past failures.",
      "Bruce Ledewitz, a law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, criticized the mindset behind the executive order as that of a powerful group claiming victimhood.",
      "The Christian conservative movement \u2014 a core Republican constituency \u2014 now has significant sway on the Supreme Court and in numerous states, Congress and the presidency, Ledewitz said. And still, they declare, \u201cWe are victims,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a struggle for the soul of America,\u201d said Ledewitz, who studies the relationship between constitutional law and religion. \u201cWe call this a culture war, but it\u2019s very deep,\u201d animated by the charge \u201cthat you people, the Democrats, you are not religious, and we are.\u201d",
      "Trump said exactly that at a National Prayer Breakfast gathering on Feb. 6.",
      "\u201cThe opposing side, they oppose religion, they oppose God,\u201d Trump claimed, accusing the previous administration of engaging in \u201cpersecution.\" President Joe Biden, a regular Mass-attending Catholic, often spoke of drawing on the values of his faith and had warm relations with Pope Francis.",
      "But Ryan Bangert, a senior vice president at the conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, said the task force is overdue.",
      "He said the Biden administration was \u201cdeliberately targeting Christian beliefs through discriminatory policies\u201d on issues such as abortion and gender. These are \u201cnot fringe beliefs\u201d and are shared by other religious groups besides Christians, he said.",
      "Critics said Trump is claiming to see persecution in distorted case descriptions, a calendar coincidence and other situations that, while raising concerns, don\u2019t add up to a pattern.",
      "For example, Trump spoke at the prayer breakfast about how he pardoned a set of abortion protesters. He mischaracterized the case of one woman, who was sentenced to prison at age 75, as being \u201cput in jail because she was praying.\u201d She and co-defendants were sentenced for blockading an abortion clinic in violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, enacted in the 1990s after violent attacks on abortion providers.",
      "But Bangert said the Biden administration \u201cseverely weaponized\u201d the FACE Act, being far more aggressive against anti-abortion protesters than those who vandalized or threatened other institutions protected by the same act, including churches and pregnancy centers that counsel women not to have abortions. Those incurred a spate of attacks after the Supreme Court, in 2022, overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had made abortion legal nationwide.",
      "A Biden-era Justice Department document lists one case of a conviction of three activists who supported abortion rights and vandalized pregnancy centers. That list otherwise documents numerous prosecutions against anti-abortion protesters who blockaded, threatened or disrupted clinic activities.",
      "The act was \u201csimply deployed to prosecute pro-life advocates who, had they been advocating for any other set of beliefs, would never have been prosecuted by the government,\u201d Bangert said. \u201cYet the Biden administration refused to enforce the FACE Act in cases where pro-life pregnancy centers or churches or synagogues were targeted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops welcomed the creation of the task force.",
      "\u201cWe are hopeful in hearing the news that the Administration is seeking to address anti-Christian bias and incidents, and we stand ready to offer our own insights into how we might ensure that all people are able to fully exercise their religious freedom,\u201d said conference spokesperson Chieko Noguchi.",
      "The conference keeps a running list of reports of vandalism and attacks on churches, reporting at least 366 cases of arson, damaged religious statues and other incidents since 2020. The conference\u2019s religious liberty committee released a report in 2024 citing a bipartisan list of concerns ranging from mandates from the Biden administration regarding gender and abortion to a crackdown by Texas\u2019 Republican attorney general on Catholic organizations serving immigrants.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order claims that Biden-era equal-employment officials sought to \u201cforce Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith\u201d and that another department \u201csought to drive Christians out of the foster-care system.\u201d",
      "Trump claimed the FBI in 2023 \u201casserted that traditional Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as \u2019threat mitigation.\u2019\u201d",
      "The claim emerged from the case of a man of who pleaded guilty to a federal weapons charge and who had spoken of intending to kill Jews and other minorities. He had been attending a church espousing traditionalist Catholic beliefs -- though not in communion with the pope \u2013 where he reportedly sought to recruit others, according to a Justice Department review.",
      "A leaked FBI report cited a purported link between \u201cRacially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists\u201d and \u201cRadical Traditionalist Catholic\u201d adherents.",
      "A Justice Department inspector general subsequently found \u201cthere was no evidence of malicious intent\u201d but that the memo showed a failure to \u201cadhere to analytic tradecraft standards.\u201d",
      "Trump also cited a calendar mashup.",
      "Biden had issued a declaration proclaiming March 31, 2024, as \u201cTransgender Day of Visibility,\u201d which occurs annually on that date. In 2024, that date also happened to be Easter Sunday. While churches have a range of views on LGBTQ+ issues, the proclamation\u2019s timing led to indignant responses from conservative Christian leaders that do not affirm transgender identity.",
      "A White House action focused on a specific religion is not unprecedented. The Biden administration, for example, issued strategy plans to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia.",
      "The secular advocacy group Freedom From Religion Foundation questioned the new task force on the social media platform X, saying \u201cgovernment\u2019s job is to protect everyone\u2019s rights, not give special treatment to one religion.\u201d It questioned whether the task force would \u201cjust push a Christian nationalist agenda.\u201d",
      "Ledewitz said the task force doesn\u2019t violate the constitutional prohibition on the state establishment of a religion \u2014 in theory.",
      "\u201cIf, in practice, it\u2019s going to have government promote Christianity, that violates the Establishment clause,\u201d he said.",
      "Ledewitz cited the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, saying that his state\u2019s Civil Rights Commission showed \u201chostility\u201d to his religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cGovernment is not allowed to be hostile to religion,\u201d Ledewitz said.",
      "However, Ledewitz said there is no case to be made for U.S. Christians suffering systemic persecution.",
      "Though the numbers of people without religion have grown to about 3 in 10 American adults, Christians still make up nearly two-thirds of the population.",
      "Matthew Taylor, Protestant scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies in Baltimore, said the task force raises concerns. Taylor\u2019s 2024 book, \u201cThe Violent Take It By Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy,\u201d recounts the role of charismatic leaders who have been among Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters.",
      "In a majority Christian country, \u201cit\u2019s a bit absurd to claim that there is widespread anti-Christian bias,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen a majority begins to claim persecution, that is often a license for attacks on minorities.\u201d",

      "The Democrat said ICE agents would be focused on assisting the correction department\u2019s intelligence bureau in criminal investigations, particularly those focused on violent criminals and gangs.",
      "\u201cAs I have always said, immigrants have been crucial in building our city and will continue to be key to our future success, but we must fix our long-broken immigration system,\u201d Adams said in a statement. \u201cThat is why I have been clear that I want to work with the new federal administration, not war with them, to find common ground and make better the lives of New Yorkers.\u201d",
      "Opponents dismissed the move as a \u201cneedless concession\u201d and \u201clegally dubious.\u201d",

      "The Democrat is under unique pressure to cooperate with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to dismiss corruption charges against Adams so he could focus on assisting the president\u2019s immigration agenda.",

      "An Albuquerque attorney who investigators allege was at the center of a sweeping corruption scandal that allowed people arrested for driving while intoxicated to evade conviction has pleaded guilty to federal charges",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- An Albuquerque attorney who investigators alleged was at the center of a sweeping corruption scandal that allowed people arrested for driving while intoxicated to evade conviction has pleaded guilty to federal charges, according to a plea agreement filed Wednesday.",
      "Thomas Clear III admitted to running what federal authorities have referred to as a \u201cDWI Enterprise\u201d in which his firm offered gifts and thousands of dollars in bribes to officers in exchange for having DWI cases dismissed. His plea comes a day after he was suspended from practicing law by the New Mexico Supreme Court.",
      "A third former Albuquerque police officer, Neill Elsman, also pleaded guilty Wednesday. He was among 12 officers placed on leave after the allegations became public last year.",
      "Clear pleaded guilty to racketeering, bribery and two extortion related counts. Elsman pleaded guilty to receiving a bribe and two counts of attempted interference with commerce by extortion.",
      "Clear's former paralegal Ricardo Mendez pleaded guilty to a slew of federal charges last month that included racketeering and bribery.",
      "Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said Wednesday that his department worked with the FBI and federal prosecutors to expose the scheme and that the police force has worked internally to hold officers accountable. Aside from three former officers reaching plea agreements, Medina noted that 10 officers have left the department as a result of the investigation.",
      "\u201cAs I have said, we will leave no stone unturned, even if it means going back 30 years to scrutinize the actions of officers,\u201d Medina said. \u201cWe are learning more details every day and we anticipate exposing more wrongdoing as our investigation continues.\u201d",
      "In his plea agreement, Clear said he worked with numerous officers from the Albuquerque Police Department, New Mexico State Police and the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office as part of the scheme, in which officers would receive money or gifts to not appear in court as a necessary witness to the driving incident, resulting in the dismissal of the case.",
      "Clear said the enterprise evolved over the years, growing as more Albuquerque officers began referring cases to his law firm so they could secure and increase payments to themselves. He said some officers would help recruit and train the \u201cnext generation\u201d within the police force's DWI unit so they also could participate in the scheme.",
      "Clear also said Mendez was warned about which officers to stay away from, explaining there were some in the unit who would have reported the criminal activity had they known about it. Still, he said, generational participation in the scheme allowed it to \u201ctake root amongst almost the entire APD DWI unit over a lengthy period of time.\u201d"

      "Palm Beach Zoo has unveiled its newest Malayan tiger as part of the zoo's expansion of its tiger conservatory",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an enclosure shadowed by tall trees entangled among natural Florida greenery, Olan stood proudly behind metal wiring separating him from Palm Beach Zoo\u2019s onlookers.",
      "Among the sound of rustling leaves and a trickling waterfall, the 11-year-old tiger momentarily stared up at a large log \u2014 his access point connecting trail corridors for the zoo\u2019s new neighboring habitat.",
      "Upon a call from his trainer, he leaped upwards into the corridor above all the zoogoers and stared downward while the sun beamed above him. Then, he swiftly entered the neighboring corridor, where a trainer awaited with his favorite treat: goat\u2019s milk in a bottle.",
      "Olan is the newest addition to the zoo\u2019s tiger habitat, which opens to the public Saturday. This \u201cTiger Forest\u201d also rotates two other Malayan tigers, Api and Kadar.",
      "In announcing Olan\u2019s debut to zoogoers, zoo officials held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday to unveil the elevated trails connecting the three enclosed habitats \u2014 a feature making this South Florida zoo unique to other habitats nationally. Patrons hope other conservatories also build corridors so tigers can mimic behaviors they\u2019d have in the wild, said Erin Ward, the zoo\u2019s vice president for marketing.",
      "Yet despite Olan\u2019s recent arrival, he\u2019s conformed seamlessly, said Callie Carpenter, an associate curator who works with Olan. Every tiger is different, she said, but Olan is \u201cbold,\u201d and she recounted Olan's playfulness with giant boomer balls or large tubs of water.",
      "\u201cOlan would take those tubs and just dump all of the water out and try to rearrange the furniture,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cRather than just like, you know, \u2018I\u2019m going to play with it a little bit,\u2019 he would just be bouncing off the walls excited about the enrichment items.\u201d",
      "Since Olan\u2019s arrival from a zoo in El Paso, Texas, he\u2019s revealed to the zoo\u2019s caretakers his agility through the habitat\u2019s trails, his endearment to smelling cinnamon and his wild playfulness.",
      "Another role Olan brings to the conservatory is his potential to mate with the female tiger, Api. The zoo hopes to breed the tigers to preserve the endangered species, yet the zoo\u2019s veterinarian Carrie Ullmer said it takes lots of examinations to determine whether the tigers' genetics are compatible.",
      "\u201cHe moved here to give us an option to maintain genetic diversity by being potentially paired with Api in the future,\u201d Ullmer said. \u201cWe want to make sure before we put them together that she is absolutely healthy enough to maintain the pregnancy.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 03:20:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president ordered his staff to develop a response to countries with trade policies he says are unfair.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",
      "But surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households.",
      "A recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats.",
      "\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".",

      "But that won't include 93-year-old Margaret Chappell whose work was done in 2021 and now her house is consumed by damp, black mould and crumbling plaster.",
      "The government said it would keep other schemes under review but Mrs Chappell said she and other residents were being ''ignored\".",
      "\"It's as if we don't exist. It's appalling,\" added Mrs Chappell, who has lived in her home in County Durham for 60 years.",
      "She and 153 of her neighbours in the town of Chilton had solid wall insulation fitted after Durham County Council advised them to take advantage of a free government scheme.",
      "They were told the work would help make their homes warmer and lower their energy bills. But Mrs Chappell, who suffers from chronic asthma, said that since then, damp has consumed her living room.",
      "Her wallpaper has peeled off and the plaster behind it is saturated and crumbling.",
      "\"I don't want to be sitting here, breathing in this dust,\" she said.",
      "More than three million homes in the UK have had insulation fitted under government schemes including 260,000 properties which have had solid wall insulation.",
      "In October, the BBC told the story of 84-year-old Tormuja Khatun from Luton whose house with unsuitable solid wall insulation had mushrooms growing on the walls and dry rot feeding off the floor joists.",
      "Since then the house became so dangerous to live in she had to move out. Her family has been warned it will cost more than \u00a3100,000 to fix.",

      "Not long after this BBC report, the government ordered an audit by the independent organisation Trustmark of more than 1,000 properties that have had solid wall insulation. It found that in half of the homes audited the work had not been done to the required standard.",
      "The Minister for Energy Consumers, Miatta Fahnbulleh MP, told Parliament last month that the audit had found ''serious systemic'' problems. She said installers would be required to fix and pay for any problems.",
      "The energy regulator Ofgem is now trying to establish how widespread the problems are and has written to 65,000 households that have had solid wall insulation since 2022 under the government's ECO4 and GBIS schemes.",
      "But because the homes in Chilton were done under a different government programme, called the Local Authority Delivery Scheme, there is currently no plan to contact residents.",
      "The government said it was ''currently confident the quality of works under the Local Authority Delivery scheme was high'' but it would keep the situation under review.",
      "'Catastrophic scheme'",
      "Building surveyor, David Walter, has been inspecting insulated properties for 25 years. He assessed the damage at several of the homes in Chilton and said ''poor design and poor workmanship'' had led to rain penetration which was causing the damp and mould.",
      "In Mr Walter's view the properties were unsuitable for solid wall insulation and said it would have to be removed from all of the properties. He warned this could cost tens of thousands of pounds per home to fix.",
      "He said the cost \"could actually exceed the market value'' of each house and added ''it just demonstrates what a catastrophic scheme it's been.''",
      "'Somebody needs to act'",
      "Susan Haslam said she has been fighting to get the damage repaired to her late parents', Bob and Maureen's Chilton home ever since they died three years ago.",
      "She said her father worried about the damp as he cared for her mother, who had dementia.",
      "She said the stress had prevented her family from being able to grieve properly for their parents, who saw the house \"as part of their legacy,\" after working for decades.",
      "\"We don't want to let them down, we want it to be sorted for them and for us,\" she said. \"Somebody is responsible and they need to act.\"",
      "The company hired by Durham County Council to do the work on Mrs Chappell's house, Tolent, went bust before the installations were completed.",
      "Tolent sub-contracted the work to another firm, Westdale North Ltd, which says it is \"still on site, and working on issues that have arisen.\"",
      "It added that it was doing the work \"as a goodwill gesture although it may not legally be required to do so\" adding \"the care and consideration we have for residents is a core part of our service.\"",

      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "The UK government has given its strongest signal yet that it will seek exemptions from tariffs being threatened on British steel entering the US.",
      "US President Donald Trump has announced 25% taxes on steel entering the country, meaning American businesses face having to pay more to import the metal.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",
      "Trump has previously said the tariffs will be enforced on 12 March \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Reynolds acknowledged there was a global oversupply of steel and aluminium but said he would argue to the Trump administration that the UK was not the problem.",
      "His comments also suggested that the UK would be reluctant to join potential retaliation by the EU to any further tariffs imposed by the US, adding that \"the UK national interest was best served by free trade\".",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods from overseas, not by the foreign companies selling the products.",
      "There are concerns that the measures could lead to a rise in inflation if the company buying the goods passes on the cost of the tariff by charging their customers more.",
      "In some cases, the company could decide to absorb the costs themselves, or simply to reduce imports, which would hit foreign exporters - and in the UK's case, British steelmakers exporting to the US.",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "The threat of trade tariffs has been noted to have created uncertainty for UK businesses, which are set to be hit by higher taxes from April.",
      "Reynolds conceded that tax rises on businesses announced in Budget had been \"challenging\" for firms of whom the government was \"asking a lot\".",
      "Appearing before a gathering of business leaders near Kings Cross, Reynolds announced new guidance for the competition watchdog to be more agile, speedy, and less risk averse.",
      "The meeting came after the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority [CMA] was recently forced out by ministers over concerns it had not been sufficiently focused on economic growth.",
      "The business secretary hinted the government could take further action to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses.",

      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",
      "In a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.",
      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Reeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006",
      "The rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.",
      "A photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.",
      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",

      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",

      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",

      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",

      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",

      "The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two board members that satisfied diversity requirements, one of whom had to be a woman.",
      "But Richard Gnodde told the BBC: \"That policy was put in place to try and drive a change in behaviour and I think that's happened.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the UK government needed to get on and start infrastructure projects now.",
      "Goldman Sachs introduced its diversity policy on boards in 2020, initially mandating that companies who wanted to float had to have one diverse member, before increasing it to two people.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"I think what is important is that you have a diversity of views on that board and if you look at these companies they've all embraced diversity, it's moved along.",
      "\"I think it has served its purpose.\"",
      "According to think tank The Conference Board, although US boards are \"more diverse than ever\", there was a \"marked slowdown\" in racial diversity hiring on boards between 2022 and 2024.",
      "Among the 500 largest US firms, the share of non-white directors was 26% and the share of women directors was 34% in 2024, according to the think tank.",

      "In one of his first acts after being sworn in, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end \"radical and wasteful government DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion ] programs\".",
      "A number of companies have since rowed back on diverse hiring programs, including Google and Meta, the firm that owns Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Asked whether firms were stepping back from policies around diversity because of the Trump White House, Mr Gnodde said: \"I can only speak for ourselves, I don't think that's the case.",
      "\"Our ambitions are to continue to take things forward and frankly to go much further than we have been.\"",
      "'Animal spirits'",
      "However, he conceded that uncertainty caused by Trump's policy on trade tariffs was weighing on companies' \"animal spirits\" and their appetite for investment.",
      "\"I think right now, the mood is on the margin [is] a little tempered, because people are uncertain about exactly what the policy outcome will be and exactly what the impacts will be,\" said Mr Gnodde.",

      "An advert by fashion brand Next has been banned because the model's pose and the camera angle gave the impression she was \"unhealthily thin\".",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) compared the advert with other photos of the same model and did not think she looked unhealthily thin in those.",
      "But it said in the now-banned image, emphasising the thinness of the model's legs using camera angles, pose and styling was \"irresponsible\".",
      "Next said it disagreed with the advertising watchdog's decision and said the model, while slim, had a \"healthy and toned physique\".",
      "In response to the ASA, the retailer said the 5'9\" model's pose was chosen \"specifically to display the leggings' fit on both straight and bent legs\", and that the image, which was shot nearly two years ago, was created with a \"strong sense of responsibility\".",
      "A spokesperson added a Next stylist and product image manager met the model in person and \"did not have any concerns about her health\".",
      "In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged the model's face \"did not appear to be gaunt and her arms, while slim, did not display any protruding bones\".",
      "But it said: \"Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model's legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin.\"",

      "The ASA told Next that its advert breached the code for social responsibility.",

      "But Ms Moss told BBC Breakfast she thinks the body positivity movement is \"slightly under threat\".",

      "Heathrow Airport has confirmed a multi-billion pound investment plan to expand two of its terminals ahead of submitting proposals for a third runway to the government this summer.",
      "Heathrow Airport chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he wants planes to take off from its new third runway before the end of the next parliament, which could be ten years or fewer.",
      "The plans, which will be paid for with private cash, come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves backed a third runway at the UK's largest airport last month as part of efforts to grow the UK economy.",
      "Reeves' decision to back Heathrow's expansion has angered campaigners and members of her party who oppose it on environmental grounds.",
      "During his speech at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, Mr Woldbye signed a pact to use UK steel to build new infrastructure.",
      "He also revealed funding to increase capacity at terminals two and five, and plans to reconfigure the airfield and improve bus connections.",
      "The commitment to use UK-made steel comes amid concern in the industry over the impact of tariffs being placed on imports of the metal to the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "The US import taxes could lead to excess steel being offloaded to the UK at cheaper prices, with the potential to undercut domestic businesses.",
      "While the detailed plans for a third runway at the UK's largest airport, are yet to be finalised, the construction of terminal five, which opened in 2008, required some 80,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "The expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial and faces opposition from environmental groups, many politicians, as well as nearby local authorities and residents.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "\"A third runway at Heathrow can not be a choice between economic growth and the environment,\" Mr Woldbye said.",
      "He added that it was a \"collective mission\" to grow Heathrow \"responsibly within environmental boundaries.\"",
      "The aviation industry is a source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and it's already under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr Woldbye outlined the expansion plan ahead of the new runway, which will see upgrades to terminal buildings to \"enhance passenger experience and improve resilience and sustainability\".",
      "\"This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year,\" he said.",
      "The chancellor has said expansion at Heathrow is \"badly needed\" and could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "Zengwei An, chief executive of British Steel - which has the only facility in the country to make primary steel - said its workers in Scunthorpe and Teeside had a \"distinguished history of supplying world-class products into projects like Heathrow's expansion\".",
      "Gareth Stace, director-general of the steel industry body UK Steel, added that Heathrow committing to using domestically-made steel was a \"major vote of confidence in UK steelmaking and British businesses full stop\".",
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built in 10 years, Reeves says",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building it could take about seven years.",
      "Reeves has said she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" before 2029 and planes to start using the runway by 2035, but Mr Woldbye has previously warned the project would take years and need \"Churchillian resolve\" to deliver.",
      "In his speech, the Heathrow boss said the airport's expansion plans will be carried out with \"strict environmental safeguards\"",
      "\"This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon... it's as simple as that,\" he added.",
      "\"I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.\"",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and provides a key avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is strained: last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit. A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000."

      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",

      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",

      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",

      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:31:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Kindness influencers give away money and gifts but not everyone supports their work.",
    "story": [
      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",
      "Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car.",
      "After that, more thought goes into longer term help.",
      "\"We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,\" he says.",

    "title": "Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",

      "Cold and leaky school 'causing pupils stress'",
      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",

      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

      "A Christian school worker sacked after sharing posts about LGBT+ relationships teaching in school has won a Court of Appeal battle.",
      "Kristie Higgs lost her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019.",
      "She had challenged in 2023 an employment appeal tribunal judgement, which ruled in her favour but sent the case back to another tribunal for a fresh decision on whether her dismissal was lawful - a step her lawyers described as \"unnecessary\".",
      "In the judgement published on Wednesday, three judges ruled in her favour and found the decision to take the case back to an employment tribunals was \"unlawfully discriminatory\".",
      "In October 2018, Mrs Higgs shared two posts to Facebook to about 100 friends under her maiden name, one of which referred to \"brainwashing our children\".",
      "Another referred to \"suppressing Christianity and removing it from the public arena\".",
      "The posts referred to LGBT+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) teaching at her son's Church of England primary school, rather than at the school she worked at.",
      "In the ruling handed down earlier, Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, said Ms Higgs had posted messages \"mostly quoted from other sources, objecting to government policy on sex education in primary schools because of its promotion of 'gender fluidity' and its equation of same-sex marriage with marriage between a man and a woman\".",
      "The ruling said it was not disputed that Mrs Higgs' beliefs that gender is binary and same-sex marriage cannot be equated to marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The school had dismissed Mrs Higgs for gross misconduct, on the basis that her posts were liable to damage the school's reputation.",
      "In their ruling, the judges said neither the language of Mrs Higgs' posts or the risk of reputational damage to the school were capable of justifying her dismissal when she \"had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils\".",
      "'Without fear'",
      "Speaking outside court, Mrs Higgs said: \"I pray that today will prove to be a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech.",
      "\"Christians have the right to express their beliefs on social media and at other non-work-related settings without fear of being punished by their employer.\"",
      "Sean Jones KC, for the school, told the court in a written submission that remitting the case was \"the appropriate course\", adding Mrs Higgs \"was not dismissed for manifesting (her beliefs) but because the manner in which it was manifested could reasonably have caused and did cause others to think she was expressing homophobic or transphobic views\".",

      "\"If you are learning a construction skill, of course you need to be able to measure,  you need to understand ratios - but perhaps you are best off learning those as part of your on-the-job training, rather than having to do a separate English and Maths qualification,\" Skills Minister Jacqui Smith told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"[The need for a qualification] sometimes puts people off going into apprenticeships in the first place, and quite often means people can't finish those apprenticeships,\" she added.",
      "The government has also confirmed plans to reduce the minimum duration of an apprenticeship, from 12 months to eight months, from August 2025.",
      "The move has been welcomed by many businesses, who say the changes will help employers to fill skills gaps more swiftly.",
      "\"Shorter apprenticeships will allow more people to move quickly, with the right skills, into key roles in shortage sectors like renewable energy and the health service - filling crucial skills gaps,\" explained David Hughes, Association of Colleges chief executive.",
      "Significant barrier",
      "Failing to secure a qualification in Maths or English is one of the key reasons apprentices do not complete courses.",
      "But EDSK, an education think tank, previously found a majority of those who dropped out of apprenticeships also cited \"poor quality\" schemes, highlighting a lack of training and bad management.",

      "David Smith, chief executive of Lifetime, England's largest apprenticeship provider,  welcomed the rule change, saying it would help address a significant barrier for many apprentices, particularly those who are considered most disadvantaged.",
      "But Mr Smith said he was \"disappointed\" the change was not extended to apprentices aged 16-18.",
      "The Learning and Work Institute, however, believe it is a mistake to reduce the minimum length of an apprenticeship, and criticised the government decision to remove any requirement for those over 19 to obtain qualifications in English and Maths.",

      "The last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.",

      "Fekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.",
      "\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.",
      "Why Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "Why Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "Productions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.",
      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "Mel Gibson, Jeff Bridges and other LA celebrities lose homes to wildfires",
      "'I have nothing to go back to' - LA fires heartbreak",
      "Hollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.",
      "Many say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA.",
      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.",

      "It's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",
      "He says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.",
      "If passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.",

      "\"troubled Hollywood\".",
      "It's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.",
      "On a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.",
      "\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.",
      "Although he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.",
      "Ms Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.",
      "\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"",
      "Others think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.",
      "Pointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.",
      "His once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.",
      "\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.",
      "About a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.",
      "She laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.",
      "\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who now sleeps at friends' homes or in her car with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.",
      "Ms Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.",
      "\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"",
      "Does she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?",
      "\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\""

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 01:36:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Jurors had been questioned about whether Rihanna's connection to the case could sway the verdict",
    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",
      "A$AP Rocky's trial begins with prosecutors showing video of shooting",

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",
      "The NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.",

      "The pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015 - and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.",
      "In the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.",
      "Maybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team.",
      "Lady Gaga's surprise performance",
      "Before kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans' historic French Quarter.",
      "The star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.",
      "Gaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.",

      "\"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\"",
      "Musical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.",
      "Musician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.",
      "And just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano."

    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As a young boy, film editor Nick Emerson's fascination with 1970s American political thrillers, and watching the unfolding peace talks in Northern Ireland, set him on a path that would lead to him working on one of the most acclaimed films of last year.",
      "Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, is leading this year's Bafta nominations, receiving nods in 12 categories, including Best Editing.",
      "The film is also thought to be a strong contender for the best picture award at next month's Oscars, and several of its stars, and Emerson, could also be in contention for individual prizes.",
      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",
      "\"Working in the BBC newsroom at the start of my career was a really exciting place to be,\" he said.",

      "He describes Conclave - which follows a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals as they select the new Pope - in similar terms.",
      "\"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on... people with competing interests and competing ideologies.\"",
      "Emerson moved through the media industry, inspired by his experience in the BBC Newsroom in Belfast.",
      "\"I found myself doing factual TV and now feature films. Its the process, that's the joy of it for me.\"",
      "Conclave opens with the death of the Pope, prompting cardinals to gather in Rome to select a new head of the Catholic Church.",

    "summary": "After Lamar's show, a reminder of where we are now in the big rap feud, and exactly how we got here.",
    "story": [
      "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.",
      "The Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.",
      "Drake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.",
      "The origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:",
      "'The big three'",
      "In March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.",
      "Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.",
      "In it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".",
      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",
      "Soon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.",
      "He told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"",
      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",
      "What's more he used artificial intelligence to deliver the insults in the voices of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.",
      "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
      "Taylor Swift, Lionel Messi, Jay-Z and Trump among big names at Super Bowl",
      "Eagles demolish Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peat",
      "Kendrick comes out fighting",
      "Lamar finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute riposte on record.",
      "Titled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it saw him brand Drake as \"predictable\", a \"master manipulator\" and a \"habitual liar\",  while calling his sparring partner's parenting skills into question.",
      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",
      "Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.",
      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",
      "But the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.",
      "\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.",
      "Drake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof.",
      "\"Drake is not a name that you gonn' see on no sex offender list, easy does it / You mentioning A minor \u2026 B sharp and tell the fans: Who was it?\"",
      "Club hit",
      "Lamar's pop-orientated Not Like Us became a big summer club hit - picking up 21 million streams in its first three days of release.",
      "It went on to earn one billion streams on Spotify and later five Grammy Awards, at last month's ceremony, including song of the year.",
      "Things took a darker turn, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot although there is no proof it was connected to the rappers' feud. However, the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London apparently was.",
      "At one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.",
      "Drake sues record label",
      "Fast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",
      "Williams, a Compton kid like Kendrick, performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as the headliner prowled the stage.",
      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "Cowboy Carter is, obviously, the name of Beyonc\u00e9's latest album.",
      "But \"Chitlin' Circuit\" might raise some questions in your mind.",
      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",
      "Venues were considered safe and acceptable spaces for black musicians, comedians and audiences and gave many pioneering performers a platform to hone their craft.",
      "Almost every notable black musician of the time graced the circuit at some point, including stars such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown.",
      "The circuit was \"tremendously important to the development of black music\", says Mia Bay, Professor of American History at Cambridge University.",
      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",
      "\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.",
      "\"I also think she, in some ways, has a nostalgic reference, because it was such a communal circuit with a lot of performers,\" she says.",
      "The star's latest tour stops off at notable Chitlin' Circuit cities such as Houston and Chicago.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 fan and music history content creator Nat Brown feels that's not a coincidence.",
      "Unlike Renaissance, this tour is smaller with only eight cities being played in total globally, with six of those in the US.",
      "\"It's a very small tour,\" says Nat.",
      "\"Just like it historically was with the Chitlin' Circuit, where you only went to seven to 10 places.",
      "\"And if people were able to see you - great. But most often, people missed out because you blazed through town and went to the next spot.\"",

      "It's a dilemma for the medical staff, with 15-30% of patients at the Royal Free medically fit to be discharged but unable to go home, for a myriad of reasons.",
      "The hospital has its own discharge team - whose job it is to safely get patients out of the door, to free up beds for new admissions. Just under 14,000 people who are medically fit are still in English hospitals and can't go home, through no fault of their own.",
      "At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who don't need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20% of all the beds the trust has.",

The doctors and nurses on duty, professional as ever, head straight for her bed, at least six or seven people. They need to get her to the resuscitation area fast, to save her life.

      "The court heard the trust has an average turnover of \u00a3612m, and the judge said she was \"acutely aware\" that all its funds as a publicly-funded body were accounted for and that the trust was currently operating at a deficit of about \u00a3100m.",

    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Semina Halliwell, who said she was raped by an older boy, finds her death was \"unpreventable\".",
    "story": [
      "When 12-year-old Semina Halliwell was lying in hospital, she asked the consultant if she was going to die. Semina told him she had wanted \"go to sleep for a couple of days\".",
      "She was placed in an induced coma but died soon after, on 12 June 2021.",
      "Three days earlier, she had posted on social media: \"I may laugh and smile every day but I'm in so much pain.\" The same day, she went to her bedroom and swallowed her mother's prescription medication.",
      "An inquest, which concluded on Thursday, heard evidence about Semina's state of mind in the months leading up to her death.",
      "\"She went from being a bright and bubbly girl, to being depressed and withdrawn,\" Semina's mother, Rachel Halliwell, told the court. She spoke while clutching a portrait of her child and her daughter's favourite denim jacket.",
      "On Thursday, coroner Johanna Thompson recorded a short narrative conclusion.",
      "She said Semina had \"a complex social history\" and was \"exceptionally vulnerable\".",
      "\"Her death arose as a consequence of taking an overdose of her mother's prescription medication whilst in a state of distress and her intent at that time is unknown,\" she said.",
      "Rachel says Semina was a quirky child who loved watching TV, taking ballet and tap dancing lessons. She'd had the same two best friends since she was four years old, she told the BBC.",
      "\"She spent all of her childhood singing and dancing on her phone,\" Rachel says. \"She would pretend to be on a show where she was the host.\"",
      "But within months, she says a chain of events began that culminated in Semina's tragic death.",
      "During the summer of 2020, at the height of the Covid lockdown, an older boy began messaging her on Snapchat. Rachel believes he was grooming Semina.",
      "Semina then started secondary school that September. After, the change in her were \"very quick\", Rachel says.",
      "\"We'd gone from watching Barbie cartoons to becoming very withdrawn and moody,\" she says.",
      "Semina began self-harming and was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.",
      "\"Because her autism was sensory she struggled with clothes - the feel of them, the labels - she would go out in bare feet in the pouring rain and never feel the cold,\" her mum says.",
      "Semina also began wearing tights and gloves to hide self-harming scars, and was making herself sick after eating.",
      "The day before Mother's Day, in March 2021, Semina told her mum she had been sexually assaulted by an older boy in the woods a few months earlier. She said the older boy had been messaging her on Snapchat.",
      "\"She said she felt horrible, she hated herself, she felt dirty,\" Rachel says.",
      "When Semina told her mother, Rachel encouraged her to tell Merseyside Police. But the family insist officers didn't support Semina appropriately.",
      "They say the 12-year-old was told it would be a complicated case, that it could take 18 months to come to court, and that it could boil down to her word against the boy's.",
      "They left it to Semina to decide whether she wanted to pursue a prosecution.",
      "The family has since made 13 complaints to Merseyside Police about its handling of the allegation of rape made by Semina, as well as the abuse they received, both online and from the local community.",
      "The inquest concluded that none of the authorities who dealt with Semina could have prevented her death.",
      "The coroner concluded from the evidence that Semina was \"highly vulnerable\" but she did not agree with submissions from the family that Merseyside Police, Semina's school, health trusts and Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council had breached their operational duties.",
      "\"The evidence has not revealed to me any indication that a real and immediate risk to Semina's life was known to any of the state agencies at any relevant point in time which would have made her death preventable,\" she said at the end of the inquest.",
      "Merseyside Police reiterated the coroner's finding that there was no suggestion of any systemic breach on the part of the force and no evidence authorities could have prevented Semina's death.",
      "A police spokesperson told the BBC: \"We would like to express our thoughts and condolences to Semina's mum and family.\"",
      "After her family reported the incident, a campaign of bullying against Semina began - including on Snapchat - the inquest heard.",
      "She had sent a naked photograph of herself to the boy, which was circulated at school and online.",
      "So too were videos of Semina being \"jumped\" and attacked from behind by groups of girls on multiple occasions.",
      "\"She went downhill, she couldn't cope,\" Rachel says. \"The bullying was horrendous. 'The biggest slag in Year 7' - that's how she was referred to online.\"",
      "\"This case shows clear, systematic failures from Snapchat to proactively moderate its services,\" said Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, a charity set up after the death of Molly Russell.",
      "\"Just imagine the corrosive effect that that must have had on her well being and her mental health, to know that those videos were being shared, to know that you know every time that she was getting a ping on her phone that may well have been further abuse, further messages.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Snapchat described the case as tragic, saying \"our hearts go out to Semina's family\". The firm works \"in multiple ways to try to prevent and take action on this type of behaviour,\" they added.",
      "\"The only people that were helping her were myself and her mum, and we weren't qualified,\" Semina's aunt, Clare Halliwell, told the BBC. \"We'd never experienced this before, and we were begging everybody who was qualified to help, and they weren't listening.\"",
      "Before her death, Semina's social media posts and WhatsApp messages became increasingly concerning. In posts read out in court, she said she had \"no feeling\" and felt \"ruined as a person\". \"I am in such pain. I just want to be whole again,\" Semina wrote.",
      "The night she took the overdose, police were visiting Semina's house. When she said she \"had had enough\", her mother assumed she meant she was fed up with the police being there and of the wider situation.",
      "She poured a glass of juice and went upstairs to her bedroom, where she swallowed some of tablets from her mother's prescription medication.",
      "The legacy of that day weighs heavily on her loved ones.",
      "Semina and her best friend Lincoln O'Neill were \"inseparable\" from the age of four.",
      "\"She was amazing, she was funny, kind \u2013 she had a smile that could light up the whole room,\" he says, sitting in her memorial garden at the local Catholic primary school they both attended.",
      "He too noticed a big change in Semina when they moved up to secondary school.",
      "\"We started noticing her self-harming and it was scary to see.\" He says she had confided in him about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "\"You could see it took an effect on her. She started hanging out with new groups of people.\" He feels now that she started \"going down the wrong route\".",
      "In the aftermath of Semina's death, Lincoln has dropped out of school.",
      "\"It was just too much because every single day there were constant reminders that she's gone,\" he says.",
      "Rachel told the BBC that since Semina's death she has probably reported more than 100 incidents to police, including people threatening her other children, and kicking the door of their family home and shouting threats.",
      "She says within an hour of her daughter's death, trolls were posting cruel and taunting messages about her online.",
      "\"It was endless,\" Rachel says. \"They [the trolls] would put up pictures of a dead person in a coffin and add the name Semina.\" Rachel says somebody even offered a \u00a310,000 reward online to anyone who would trash her daughter's grave.",
      "\"Somebody came to the grave to visit her, and when they got there, it was just covered in dog faeces, all over the grave,\" she says.",
      "Today, Semina has a new black headstone engraved with a portrait of her wearing her favourite denim jacket. The inscription reads: \"Semina Mary Halliwell. Forever 12.\"",
      "Rachel told the BBC she wanted accountability for her daughter's death.",
      "\"Sometimes I don't think I've processed that she's gone,\" Rachel says. \"She didn't need to die.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:38:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",

      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",
      "Reeves says she won't let critics get her down",
      "MPs raise questions about Rachel Reeves's CV",
      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

    "summary": "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, official figures suggest.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",

      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",

      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

      "The tariffs, set to apply from 12 March, would mean any steel or aluminium coming into the US would be subject to an import tax worth 25% of its value.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This is because if other countries are no longer exporting to the US, they may look to offload their steel at a cheaper price, potentially leading to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Unite, the union representing UK steel workers, said Trump's announcement \"should be a wake-up call for this government\" as it called on it to buy more British steel in response.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "With Trump's tariffs looming - will countries scramble to cut deals?",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "UK ministers planned to meet the steel industry and unions on Tuesday and visit key steel companies later this week.",
      "Speaking in Parliament, Alexander said the US deadline on tariffs coming into force would give the government time to engage with steel firms and unions in the UK, and also with US trade officials.",
      "But shadow trade minister Harriett Baldwin said it was \"a moment of great peril for the UK steel industry because the UK has failed to engage with gusto with the new US administration\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged the government to show \"urgency\" in dealing with the issue and protecting jobs.",
      "The UK's direction of travel on tariffs in general appears to be a clear attempt to differentiate it from other G7 allies' attempts to project strength to the White House.",
      "Canada's industry minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has called the decision to impose tariffs \"totally unjustified\" and said its response would be \"clear and calibrated\".",
      "Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "\"We will take a considered approach to this. We will engage with the US on the detail, but the government is clear we will work in our national interest and this issue is no different to that,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Trump has announced and threatened a host of import taxes since taking office, particularly aimed at countries and trading blocs, such as the EU, which export more to the US than they import.",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies buying from overseas, not to the overseas companies selling to them.",
      "The importing company may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly or to absorb the cost themselves, or simply to reduce imports. Foreign exporters could also decide to cut their prices to protect sales.",
      "Trump introduced similar steel and aluminium tariffs in 2018 during his first term, but many countries, including the UK, were later able to work out exemptions.",
      "The US president has said he will not consider any exceptions this time round, although it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.",
      "Trump has also delayed previously announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting questions of whether the policies will all go ahead."

      "She accused the last Conservative government of failing to strengthen border enforcement as fast as European countries and focussing on \"failed gimmicks\".",
      "Her comments come as Labour's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which scraps the Tory Rwanda plan and boosts police powers against smugglers, cleared its first vote in the House of Commons.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the new plans as a \"border surrender Bill\" and claimed it creates a path to citizenship for illegal migrants.",
      "The debate came at the end of a heavily choreographed media push by the Home Office, which saw the department publish photos of illegal immigrants being deported for the first time.",
      "Earlier on Monday, the Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants. They made 609 arrests - a 73% increase on the previous January.",
      "Some Labour MPs, particularly on the left of the party, have argued the government should focus on talking about the benefits of immigration and push for creating safer immigration routes.",

      "Home Office Minister Dame Angela Eagle told the BBC the government's approach was compassionate, and it had only released arrest footage to send a message about the realities of working illegally.",
      "Labour has been pushing its immigration crackdown to the forefront at the same time as Reform UK has been rising in the polls.",
      "Reform MP Richard Tice, said immigration is \"the number one issue because it's out of control\".",

      "The Borders Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists, a promise they made repeatedly in the general election campaign.",

      "The bill also creates a new crime of endangering another person during an illegal crossing in the Channel. This is to stop those aboard a dinghy refusing assistance.",
      "Immigration enforcement teams would also get new powers to seize mobile phones.",
      "Some migrant rights groups criticise measures they say criminalise vulnerable people rather than people smugglers.",
      "Labour argues this will be a more effective way of clamping down on small boat crossings than the previous government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.",
      "The bill also repeals most of the Conservative's Illegal Migration Act 2023, which laid the legal groundwork for the Rwanda policy.",
      "Under Labour's plans, a new Border Security Command will gain more powers and a new head, who will oversee closer links between intelligence, police, and border agents.",
      "The bill passed its first vote in the House of Commons by 333 to 109 but still faces months of debate and obstacles before it can become law.",
      "Labour's large Commons majority all but guarantees the bulk of the measures will pass.",
      "MPs also rejected an attempt by the Conservatives to kill the bill, voting down their amendment by 354 to 115.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 11:43:55 GMT",
    "summary": "As Peter Mandelson takes up the role of ambassador to the US, No 10 is determined the UK builds a strong relationship with Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "When Labour lost the 2010 election, rising star Ed Miliband was asked whether Peter Mandelson, who had just published a headline-grabbing autobiography, could play a role in the party's future.",
      "\"All of us,\" Miliband drily replied, \"believe in dignity in retirement.\"",
      "Mandelson winced and smiled at that quip, he later wrote. But ignored the advice.",
      "Fifteen years later, at the age of 71, the political veteran who helped mastermind Labour's renewal in the 1980s and 1990s, and was twice forced to resign from Tony Blair's government, has staged yet another comeback.",
      "\"It's a whirlwind,\" admits a member of his new team in Washington. \"Because he's a whirlwind kind of guy.\"",
      "The first political appointee to the role of UK ambassador to the United States in 50 years arrived in DC with a lot on his plate. Even by American standards.",
      "But why did Sir Keir Starmer recruit him, what explains Mandelson's hunger for the job, and how does he plan to charm Team Trump?",
      "\"Peter is supremely political,\" explains a Downing Street source. \"And this is a very political White House. He is a brilliant operator.\"",
      "Lord Mandelson has already moved into the ambassador's vast official residence, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a3118.8m.",
      "His new life will involve more than Congressional meetings and cocktail parties. He now oversees 800 UK staff in the country many of whom are seconded to the Pentagon and defence bases.",
      "At the embassy, beneath a Warhol portrait of the late Queen, Mandelson has already hosted lunch for General Keith Kellogg, President Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "This was merely a warm up for the real challenge later this month: accompanying Keir Starmer to the Oval Office to meet President Trump.",
      "My criticism of Trump was wrong, says Mandelson",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "Peter Mandelson 'honoured' to be appointed US ambassador",
      "The new president may be erratic and impulsive yet No 10 officials are determined the two leaders will develop a strong relationship despite their differing personalities.",
      "\"The PM will be asking Peter: 'How on earth do I handle this crazy guy?',\" says a former colleague.",
      "\"As an ambassador in the court of Donald Trump you need someone who can tickle him under his chin. Peter will be the absolute fixer and bridge builder.\"",
      "Unlike the imminent turnover of leaders in continental Europe (Mandelson's long friendship with Emmanuel Macron is no longer so helpful), Starmer and Trump are likely to be in office and working together for the next four years.",
      "One official says part of the UK's pitch is about emphasising that both men are winners: \"Our message to him is we won big in July. You won big in November. Let's do business together.\"",
      "Mandelson has regularly provided advice to Keir Starmer in recent years and acted as an unofficial mentor to the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and director of communications Matthew Doyle.",
      "These relationships suggest Downing Street and the US embassy will have an unusually close and constant level of contact.",
      "In an administration where billionaire businessmen have unprecedented influence, Peter Mandelson's contacts from his time as EU trade commissioner, UK business secretary, and via his international lobbying firm Global Counsel is already being deployed. \"He's essentially been a businessman for the last 15 years,\" says a source.",
      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",
      "He is understood to already be planning how best to deploy his ultimate line manager with officials considering inviting the president on a second state visit to London.",
      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",
      "\"Peter's great mission in life\", they say, \"is to stay relevant.\"",

      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",

      "In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".",
      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"",
      "This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.",
      "In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.",
      "The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.",
      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",
      "Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".",
      "\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.",
      "\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"",
      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",
      "Some locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.",
      "They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.",
      "\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.",
      "\"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.",

      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",

      "The pair's heated exchanges were a symbol of global political jostling in the powerful AI arms race, but Fu Ying also expressed regret about the negative impact of current hostilities between the US and China on the progress of AI safety.",
      "\"At a time when the science is going in an upward trajectory,  the relationship is falling in the wrong direction and it is affecting unity and collaboration to manage risks,\" she said.",
      "\"It's very unfortunate.\"",
      "She gave a carefully-crafted glimpse behind the curtain of China's AI scene, describing an \"explosive period\" of innovation since the country first published its AI development plan in 2017, five years before ChatGPT became a viral sensation in the west.",
      "She added that \"when the pace [of development] is rapid, risky stuff occurs\" but did not elaborate on what might have taken place.",
      "\"The Chinese move faster [than the west] but it's full of problems,\" she said.",
      "Fu Ying argued that building AI tools on foundations which are open source, meaning everyone can see how they work and therefore contribute to improving them, was the most effective way to make sure the tech did not cause harm.",
      "Most of the US tech giants do not share the tech which drives their products.",
      "Open source offers humans \"better opportunities to detect and solve problems\",  she said, adding that \"the lack of transparency among the giants makes people nervous\".",
      "But Prof Bengio disagreed.",
      "His view was that open source also left the tech wide open for criminals to misuse.",
      "He did however concede that \"from a safety point of view\", it was easier to spot issues with the viral Chinese AI assistant DeepSeek, which was built using open source architecture, than ChatGPT, whose code has not been shared by its creator OpenAI.",
      "On Tuesday it is the turn of world leaders including French president Emmanuel Macron, India's PM Narendra Modi and US Vice President JD Vance to hold talks at the summit.",
      "Discussions will include how AI will impact the world of work and be used in the public interest, and how to mitigate its risks.",
      "A new $400m partnership between several countries has also been announced, aimed at supporting AI initiatives which serve the public interest, such as healthcare.",
      "In a BBC interview, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle said he thought it would be dangerous for the UK to fall behind in its adoption of the tech.",
      "Dr Laura Gilbert, who advises the government on AI, said she believed it was essential to maintain the NHS because of the efficiencies it promised. \"How are you going to fund the NHS without grabbing AI?\" she asked.",
      "Matt Clifford, who wrote the UK's AI Action Plan which the government has accepted in full, warned that the tech would be \"more radical\" than when typing was replaced with word processing, as computers first entered the workplace.",
      "\"The industrial revolution was the automation of physical labour; AI is the automation of cognitive labour,\" said Marc Warner, the boss of the AI firm Faculty. He added that he did not believe his two-year-old child would \"have a job as we know them today.\"",
      "What are the challenges facing the government's AI action plan?"

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "The four British families suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children have accused the tech giant of having \"no compassion\".",
      "In an exclusive group interview for BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the parents said they were taking the company to court to try to find out the truth about what happened to their children and seek accountability.",
      "The parents believe their children died after taking part in a viral trend that circulated on the video-sharing platform in 2022.",
      "TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content and challenges. It has blocked searches for videos and hashtags related to the particular challenge the children's parents say is linked to their deaths.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the US on Thursday, claims that Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney, 14, and Maia Walsh, 13, died while attempting the so-called \"blackout challenge\".",
      "The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of Archie's mother Hollie Dance, Isaac's mum Lisa Kenevan, Jools' mother Ellen Roome and Maia's dad Liam Walsh.",
      "In the interview, Ms Kenevan accused TikTok of breaching \"their own rules\". In the lawsuit, the families claim that the platform breached the rules in a number of ways,   including around not showing or promoting dangerous content that could cause significant physical harm.",
      "Ms Dance said that the bereaved families were brushed off with \"the same corporate statement\" showing \"no compassion at all - there's no meaning behind that statement for them\".",
      "Ms Roome has been campaigning for legislation that would allow parents to access the social media accounts of their children if they die. She has been trying to obtain data from TikTok that she thinks could provide clarity around his death.",
      "Ms Kenevan said they were going to court to pursue \"accountability - they need to look not just at us, but parents around the world, not just in England, it's the US and everywhere\".",
      "\"We want TikTok to be forthcoming, to help us - why hold back on giving us the data?\" Ms Kenevan continued. \"How can they sleep at night?\"",
      "'No faith' in government efforts",
      "Mr Walsh said he had \"no faith\" that the UK government's efforts to protect children online would be effective.",
      "The Online Safety Act is coming into force this spring. But Mr Walsh said, \"I don't have faith, and I'm about to find out if I'm right or wrong. Because I don't think it's baring its teeth enough. I would be forgiven for having no faith - two and a half years down the road and having no answers.\"",
      "Ms Roome said that she was grateful for the support she had from the other bereaved parents. \"You do have some days particularly bad - when it's very difficult to function,\" she said.",
      "The families' lawsuit against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance claims the deaths were \"the foreseeable result of ByteDance's engineered addiction-by-design and programming decisions\", which it says were \"aimed at pushing children into maximizing their engagement with TikTok by any means necessary\".",
      "And the lawsuit accuses ByteDance of having \"created harmful dependencies in each child\" through its design and \"flooded them with a seemingly endless stream of harms\".",
      "\"These were not harms the children searched for or wanted to see when their use of TikTok began,\" it claims.",
      "Searches for videos or hashtags related to the challenge on TikTok are blocked, a policy the company says has been in place since 2020.",
      "TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges on the platform, and directs those who search for hashtags or videos to its Safety Centre. The company told the BBC it proactively finds and removes 99% of content that breaks its rules before it is reported.",
      "TikTok says it has met with Ellen Roome to discuss her case. It says the law requires it to delete personal data, unless there is a valid request from law enforcement prior to the data being deleted."

      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",

      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",

People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",

      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:30:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC hears from the parents of four young women who were taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and held for 15 months.",
    "story": [
      "Parents of four young female Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza have told the BBC about how their daughters were abused, including being starved, intimidated and threatened by armed men, and forced to cook and clean.",
      "They recounted how the hostages were held in underground tunnels and buildings, witnessed physical abuse and were made to participate in Hamas propaganda videos, including, in one case, by faking her own death.",
      "They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary.",
      "None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk.",
      "Three of the four women whose parents spoke to the BBC were female soldiers kidnapped by Hamas from the Nahal Oz army base near Gaza on 7 October 2023.",
      "The hostages' access to food and their treatment by male guards varied over the 15 months they were held, their parents said. They were moved between locations, rarely seeing sunlight.",
      "\"It was very different between the places that she went - it could be a good tunnel, it could be a very bad tunnel. It could be a good house or a bad house,\" said the father of Agam Berger, 20, a soldier who had been at Nahal Oz.",
      "Some of the places had good food, some had \"very bad food... they just tried to survive,\" Shlomi Berger said.",
      "\"They [and their captors] had to run away from one place to another because they are in a war zone there. It was very dangerous to be there,\" said Orly Gilboa, whose daughter Daniella was also kidnapped from the base.",
      "When Daniella watched the release of three male hostages last week - who came out thin and emaciated - she told her mother: \"If I had been released two months ago I would have probably looked like them.\"",
      "\"She got thinner, she lost a lot of her weight through the captivity. But in the last two months they were given a lot of food to gain weight,\" Ms Gilboa says.",
      "Other parents have also reported significant weight loss. Meirav Leshem Gonen's daughter was taken by Hamas from the Nova music festival.",
      "Romi, 24, was released in the first week of the ceasefire in January - she had lost \"20% of her body weight\", says her mother.",
      "Ms Gilboa says the hardest thing she endured was seeing a video that suggested her daughter had been killed. Her captors poured powder on her so she looked like she was covered in plaster, as if she was killed in an Israeli military strike.",
      "\"I think everyone who saw it believed it, but I just kept telling myself that it can't be,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been destroyed or damaged, estimates the UN.",
      "So far, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been exchanged for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel under the ceasefire deal that began on 19 January.",
      "Mr Berger says his daughter, Agam, was threatened by her captors and witnessed physical abuse while in captivity.",
      "\"Sometimes they tortured other female hostages in front of her eyes,\" he says, referring specifically to an assault on Amit Soussana, a former hostage who was released in November 2023.",
      "Mr Berger says his daughter told him how they were constantly watched over by armed men, \"playing all the time with their guns and their hand grenades\".",
      "He says the male captors treated the women with \"big disrespect\", including forcing them to clean and prepare food.",
      "\"That was really bothering her. She's a girl that if she has something to say, she'll say it. She's not shy. And sometimes she told them what she was thinking about them and their behaviour,\" he says.",
      "He adds that in a small act of resistance, Agam had refused to perform any jobs on the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. The men detaining her accepted this.",
      "They were also not allowed to speak loudly.",
      "\"When Agam came [back to Israel] she wanted to speak all the time... After a day, she had no voice because she'd spoken so much,\" Mr Berger says.",
      "'We are tired of war': Israelis and Gazans fear ceasefire collapse",
      "Elderly hostage in Gaza was killed in 7 October attack, Israel says",
      "Stories of the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel",
      "Yoni Levy, whose daughter Naama, 20, was also taken from the army base, says she was sometimes held in locations where there was a TV or radio playing.",
      "Once, Naama saw her father talking on TV. \"It gave her a lot of hope and optimism... that nobody would forget her, and we'll do whatever is needed to take her out of this hell.\"",
      "He says for Naama, the Hamas attack on the army base was \"was much more traumatic than the captivity itself\".",
      "\"It may change but at this stage we think that this is the most tragic day that she's talked about,\" Mr Levy says.",
      "Footage of Naama that day shows her and other female soldiers in bloodstained clothing surrounded by armed men in a room at the base before being forced into a vehicle and taken to Gaza.",
      "The three female soldiers whose parents spoke to the BBC are among five from an all-women unarmed military unit at Nahal Oz freed in the first round of the ceasefire.",
      "Members of the unit, known in Hebrew as Tatzpitaniyot, are tasked with observing the Gaza border and looking for signs of anything suspicious. Survivors and relatives of some of those killed that day say that they had been warning for months that Hamas had been preparing for an attack.",
      "A few days before the 7 October attack, Daniella had been at home on a break from service. She had told her mother then: \"Mummy, when I go back to the army, there's going to be a war.\"",
      "\"I didn't think it was going to be such a war and of course that my daughter would be taken hostage,\" Ms Gilboa says.",
      "Ms Gilboa and the families of the two other observers who spoke to the BBC say they are joining calls for an inquiry into what happened.",
      "They say their daughters remain concerned about the conditions of those still in Gaza and have called for the ceasefire to continue.",
      "Meanwhile, Ms Leshem Gonen says she is still learning what happened to her daughter Romi.",
      "She was shot at the Nova music festival and her mother says she was not properly treated, leaving her with \"an open wound where she could see the bone\".",
      "\"This is something we can know and that she speaks about. The other things, I think it will take time.\"",
      "Ms Leshem Gonen says Romi described her release in the first week of the truce as \"intimidating\" and \"frightening\". She was surrounded by gunmen and crowds. But the moment of their reunion was \"so powerful\".",
      "The parents also described how their daughters had found ways to get through each day in captivity - through drawing, making notes or sharing stories with each other.",
      "\"They wrote as much as they could, every day - what was happening, where were they moving, who were the guards and things like that,\" says Mr Berger.",
      "While in captivity, the young women had dreamt about the things they wanted to do when they got home: getting a haircut and eating sushi.",
      "Daniella had drawn a butterfly with the word \"freedom\" while in captivity - she now has that tattooed on her arm.",
      "They are adapting to life back in Israel, and their families say they are taking the recovery step by step.",
      "The moment of reunion with his daughter Naama is still a blur, says Mr Levy, but he remembers the emotion.",
      "\"The feeling was that... I will take care of you now, and everything's going to be OK. Daddy's here. That's all. And then everything was quiet.\"",

      "Sassoon refused to drop the case, however, setting out her reasoning in a letter to Bove's boss, Attorney General Pam Bondi, on Thursday and saying she saw no \"good faith\" reason for dropping the case.",

      "The Senate is putting in late nights and early mornings as they hurry to round out the president's cabinet by confirming his remaining nominees. Lawmakers also approved Brooke Rollins as head of the Department of Agriculture by a vote of 72-28.",

      "During the hearings, lawmakers also grilled Kennedy on his promotion of health misinformation and knowledge of the US healthcare system.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",
      "But surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households.",
      "A recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats.",
      "\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".",

      "Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations.",
      "Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied.",
      "The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and \"let hell break out\" unless \"all of the hostages\" were returned by Saturday.",

      "However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend.",
      "Confusion clouds efforts to save Gaza ceasefire",
      "'We are tired of war': Israelis and Gazans fear ceasefire collapse",
      "What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were \"intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement\", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials.",

      "When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was \"crystal clear\".",
      "\"There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,\" David Mencer said. \"That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday.\"",
      "\"If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end.\"",
      "War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war.",
      "\"When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,\" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.",
      "\"I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall.\"",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza.",
      "So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal.",
      "The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named.",
      "Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the 43 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun.",
      "The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

      "Hostages' families and their supporters have been alarmed by the latest developments, as have war-weary Gazans.",
      "The fact that the Hamas leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, is leading a delegation to follow up on implementation in Cairo, shows that the armed group is also trying to get the ceasefire agreement back on track.",
      "Since 19 January, the deal has seen a total of 16 Israeli hostages brought home in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Five Thai farm workers were also released.",
      "At the same time, Israeli troops have withdrawn to just inside the perimeter of Gaza, including along the Egypt border.",
      "The relative calm has allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to their own neighbourhoods and brought in a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "However, the current impasse stems from Hamas's claim that Israel has not upheld its promises for the first phase of the truce.",
      "It says that this required Israeli authorities to allow about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans into Gaza.",
      "With so many people returning to the ruins of their homes - during cold, wet wintry weather - such shelters have been desperately needed.",
      "Fuel and generators are also said to be in short supply - especially in the north of Gaza - where they are urgently required, especially for water pumps and bakeries.",

      "The first phase of the deal is supposed to end in March, unless Hamas and Israel agree an extension. So far, negotiations on that have been put off.",
      "The Israeli prime minister delayed discussions on the next phase amid pressure from within his governing coalition and growing evidence during the ceasefire that - in contradiction to his war goals - Hamas remains a significant political and military force in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "European nations must provide the \"overwhelming\" share of funding for Ukraine, the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said, as he signalled a drastic shift in Washington's position on the war.",
      "Speaking at a defence summit in Brussels, Hegseth said the US would no longer \"tolerate an imbalanced relationship\" with its allies and called on Nato members to spend much more on defence.",
      "He also said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders and downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato.",
      "The comments came as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held a \"lengthy\" phone call in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the war.",
      "The new US defence secretary's remarks are the clearest indication yet of the Trump administration's position on the Ukraine war and what a peace plan to end the conflict could involve.",
      "The positions set out by Hegseth will be met with dismay in Ukraine - which has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal - and will be welcomed by Moscow.",
      "There will also be nervousness across the continent after Hegseth suggested the US would significantly scale back its support for Ukraine, insisting that European nations would now need to provide the \"overwhelming share\" of aid to Kyiv.",
      "Hegseth, who was appointed defence secretary after Trump returned to the US presidency in January, was speaking at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, a meeting of more than 40 countries allied to Ukraine.",
      "He said: \"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine.",
      "\"But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 and then backed pro-Russian separatists in an armed insurgency against Kyiv's forces in eastern Ukraine.",
      "Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the east and south.",
      "Hegseth said any durable peace must include \"robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again\".",
      "However, he said \"the United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement\".",
      "Instead, security guarantees should be backed by \"capable European and non-European troops\".",
      "\"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-Nato mission and they should not be covered under Article 5,\" he said, referring to the alliance's mutual defence clause.",

      "What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member?",

      "\"Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of Nato,\" Hegseth said. \"Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.\"",
      "The US has been Ukraine's biggest financial and military backer but Trump has been repeatedly critical of US aid spending and has said his priority is to end the war, which escalated in February 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "Hegseth echoed calls by Trump for Nato allies to increase their defence spending to 5% of their GDP, instead of the current 2% target - saying the latter is \"not enough\".",
      "The US currently spends roughly 3.4% of its GDP on defence, while the UK spends about 2.3%. Countries closer to Russia, like Poland and the Baltic states, spend the most proportionately at around 4%.",
      "It will be difficult for Ukraine to hold back Russia's advances without the same scale of support provided by Washington during Joe Biden's administration.",
      "While Russia is losing large numbers of troops in the conflict, the country's commanders are prepared to throw everything at Ukrainian front lines.",
      "Russia is also now spending more on defence than the whole of Europe combined, according to figures from The Military Balance, an annual comparison of the strengths of armed forces around the world.",

    "summary": "The leaders share a warm relationship, but both will have their own wish list when they meet this week.",
    "story": [
      "When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later on Thursday, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all.",
      "Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances. This time, they will also hold a joint press briefing, according to the White House.",
      "Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership.",
      "Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi.",
      "And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place.",
      "Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community.",
      "He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India.",
      "And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands.",
      "Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil.",
      "It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration.",
      "Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years.",
      "On Wednesday evening, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump planned to announce reciprocal tariffs on other countries before his meeting with Modi.",
      "But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides.",
      "In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.",
      "Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger.",
      "Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil.",
      "In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US.",
      "Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel.",
      "India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment.",
      "Technology will probably be discussed as well.",
      "This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it.",
      "Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will.",
      "Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.",
      "Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large.",
      "Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran, which hints at removing sanctions waivers for those conducting commercial activities in Chabahar. Modi may seek clarity on what this means for Delhi.",
      "Trump may also gauge Modi's position on a big foreign policy priority: ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Delhi has a strong interest in these wars winding down. Modi's position on the war in Ukraine - calling for an end to the conflict without criticising Putin or Russia - echoes that of Trump.",
      "India's special relationship with Russia and close ties with Israel may prompt Trump to see if Modi would want to play a third-party mediator role as well. Modi would probably be comfortable doing so only if the parties are receptive to outside mediation.",
      "But despite some potentially delicate discussions this week, both leaders will want to maintain a positive tone.",
      "In that regard, the Indo-Pacific Quad will be just what the doctor ordered.",
      "Trump strongly backs this group which consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia and focuses on countering Beijing.",
      "In his first term, Trump elevated the Quad's annual meetings to the foreign minister level and Biden elevated them further to the leaders' level.",
      "India is scheduled to host this year's Quad meeting and Modi may invite Trump to Delhi to attend this.",
      "Trump reportedly is not a big fan of international travel but India is a trip he will probably be keen to make - to deepen his personal relationship with Modi and to advance a multifaceted bilateral partnership that extends well beyond the transactionalism that will carry the day in Washington this week.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 20:42:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The far-right Freedom Party quits coalition talks, fuelling uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Austria's far-right populist Freedom Party says it has ended its attempts to form a coalition government with the conservative People's Party, \u00d6VP.",
      "The announcement follows several weeks of heated negotiations and marks the second time coalition talks have failed since September's election.",
      "The \u00d6VP first attempted to form a three-party coalition with the Social Democrats and the liberal NEOS, then a two-party coalition with the Social Democrats - but both efforts collapsed.",
      "With the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) unable to form a government, Austria is now in an unclear political situation.",
      "The leader of the Freedom Party, Herbert Kickl, has called for swift new elections and blamed \u00d6VP for the collapse, accusing the party of being unwilling to make compromises and playing \"power games\".",
      "\"Although we made concessions to the \u00d6VP on many points, they were not prepared to make decisive compromises. The \u00d6VP was concerned with power games and posturing - we, the Freedom Party, were concerned with security, prosperity and honesty.\"",
      "Earlier, Kickl told President Alexander Van der Bellen that he was giving up the mandate to form what would have been Austria's first far-right-led government since the FP\u00d6 was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s.",
      "The Russia-friendly and Eurosceptic Freedom Party made history in September's general election when it topped the polls for the first time with 28.8% of the vote, narrowly beating Chancellor Karl Nehammer's \u00d6VP, which got 26.3%.",
      "Despite this, in October, President Van der Bellen first gave Nehammer the mandate to form a government. However, those negotiations collapsed in early January, leading Nehammer to resign and paving the way for interim Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.",
      "On 6 January, Van der Bellen gave Kickl the mandate to form a government after other parties' efforts to create a coalition without the Freedom Party failed.",
      "Coalition negotiations in Austria usually remain secret, until a decision is reached. But over recent days, both parties issued statements about their demands, suggesting that the talks were in trouble.",
      "The Freedom Party wanted both the powerful finance ministry and the interior ministry, which was a major obstacle for the \u00d6VP. For its part, the \u00d6VP wanted confirmation of \"the absence of Russian influence in Austria,\" and Vienna remaining \"a reliable partner to the European Union\".",
      "Kickl said on Wednesday that he was giving up the mandate, writing in a statement that he did \"not take this step without regret\".",
      "He continued: \"The \u00d6VP insisted on clarifying the allocation of portfolios at the beginning of February. Although we made concessions to the \u00d6VP on many points in the subsequent talks, the negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful, much to our regret.\"",
      "The General Secretary of the \u00d6VP, Alexander Pr\u00f6ll, said the talks had failed because Kickl was on a \"power trip\" and had refused to compromise.",
      "\"Herbert Kickl himself was hardly involved in the government negotiations. In five weeks, Kickl sat at the negotiating table for a total of seven hours,\" he said.",
      "\"He did not fulfil his mandate to form\u2026 a centre-right government. Instead, he insisted on all his demands, developed fantasies of total power and ended the talks.\"",
      "Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC that there was \"no base of trust\" between the two parties.",
      "\"Kickl tried to adopt Trump's playbook of 'promises kept' but that's hard in a coalition environment.",
      "\"The \u00d6VP decided in the end that losing the two major ministries with a Chancellor Kickl who can't be controlled, and no base of trust was too risky,\" he said.",
      "The \u00d6VP was the only party that had been willing to negotiate with the Freedom Party.",
      "President Alexander Van der Bellen said Austria now had four options after the collapse of the coalition talks.",
      "These were new elections, a minority government, a government of experts or another attempt to form a government by the parliamentary parties, he said.",
      "He said he would hold talks with the political parties in Austria over the next few days to see which option was realistic.",

    "summary": "A wildfire has burnt through 55% of Amsterdam Island, a French foreign territory in the Indian Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly a month the French territory of Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean has been engulfed in flames.",
      "Located about halfway between Australia, Antarctica and Madagascar, the island has seen burning across more than 55% of its 54 sq km area.",
      "Amsterdam Island doesn't have a permanent population but researchers have been stationed there since the 1980s.",
      "Since the fires broke out, 31 people have been evacuated to R\u00e9union Island, closer to Madagascar. And last week French authorities launched a mission to control the wildfires and assess their impact.",
      "The most recent blaze was discovered on15 January by a scientist researching the atmosphere.",
      "According to a report from the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences (LCES),  it broke out near the Pointe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte observatory which monitors greenhouse gases, mercury, and aerosols in the atmosphere.",
      "Despite residents' best efforts, the fire spread towards the research base at Martin-de-Vivi\u00e8s. They were evacuated early the following day by a lobster fishing boat, the Austral, which was cruising nearby.",
      "R\u00e9mi Chazot, a computer scientist who was based on the island, told Le Monde newspaper the group was \"incredibly lucky\" that the boat was in the area.",
      "\"This boat should have left a week earlier, but it had not caught its lobster quota. Otherwise, things would have gotten complicated.\"",
      "The evacuees have since been transferred to Reunion, another French territory.",
      "The fire spread across Amsterdam Island due to dry conditions and strong winds. The island does not have a river and winds can reach up to 40 km/h (24 mph). It is thought to have partly spread via the island's network of peat bogs.",
      "Although the full scale of the damage has not yet been assessed, satellite imagery has shown the island's solar panels have been affected by the fire as well as its food and communication lines.",
      "Conservationists have also expressed concern about the impact on wildlife.",
      "Due to its unusual climate, the island is rich in biodiversity, serving as a breeding site for southern elephant and sub- Antarctic fur seals.",
      "It is home to several albatross species including the Amsterdam Albatross, which breed exclusively on the island, and 84% of the world's yellow-nosed albatross population. A colony of Southern rockhopper penguin also live on the island.",
      "Due to its remoteness and subsequent lack of pollution, the island is also used to research changes in the atmosphere and how this affects climate.",
      "The evacuation is the first time atmospheric research has been suspended on the island for 45 years.",
      "\"It will take time and money to return to normal and this pause will mean quite a lack of data acquisition for our research\", said Marc Delotte, the director of the LCES's mission to the Amsterdam Islands.",
      "\"This is, of course, not a good news for such a unique location.\"",
      "On the 7 February a reconnaissance mission set sail aboard a French navy vessel.",
      "According to France's Southern and Antarctic Territories department, the mission is made up of four firefighters from Reunion and seven technical staff, one of whom is a doctor.",
      "Rather than putting out the fire entirely, the mission intends to secure the settlement. They'll also aim to uncover the cause of the fire and how it spread, as well as re-establish the island's energy and water mains."

      "I last visited this area in 2023, when Ukraine launched a much-anticipated counter-offensive.",

    "story": [
      "America is under new management. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is joining a growing list of US allies who are finding that the world according to Donald Trump is a colder, more uncertain and potentially more dangerous place for them.",
      "It must have been bad enough for Zelensky to hear Trump's abrupt announcement that he had welcomed Russia's President Vladimir Putin back to international diplomacy with a 90-minute phone call, to be followed by a face-to-face meeting, perhaps in Saudi Arabia.",
      "After Putin, the White House dialled up Zelensky's number. Speaking to journalists in Ukraine the morning after, Zelensky accepted the fact that Putin received the first call, \"although to be honest, it's not very pleasant\".",
      "What stung Zelensky more was that Trump, who rang him after he spoke to Putin, seemed to regard him, at best, as a junior adjunct to any peace talks. One of Zelensky's many nightmares must be the prospect of Trump and Putin attempting to settle Ukraine's future without anyone else in the negotiation.",
      "He told the journalists that Ukraine \"will not be able to accept any agreements\" made without its involvement.",
      "It was vital, he said, that \"everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral\".",
      "President Zelensky is heading to the Munich security conference, starting on Friday, where he will attempt to rally Ukraine's allies. He faces a tough meeting with Trump's vice president, JD Vance, who was one of the sternest critics of Joe Biden's aid to Ukraine.",
      "The argument Zelensky will hear from the Americans is that Ukraine is losing and it needs to get real about what happens next. He will argue that Ukraine can win - with the right backing.",
      "The European Union is worried too. After meeting and praising the Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas posted that Europe must have a central role in any negotiation. \"Our priority now must be strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees,\" Kallas said.",
      "Zelensky is painfully aware that while his European allies are sounding much more steadfast than the Americans, the US remains the world's strongest military power. He told the Guardian last week that \"security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees\".",
      "Collectively, European allies have given Ukraine more money than the US. But the Americans have weapons and air defence systems - like the Patriot missile batteries that protect Kyiv - that Europeans simply cannot provide.",
      "Putin will be delighted that he is getting a much easier ride than he had from Biden. The former US president called Putin, among other things, a \"pure thug\", a \"brutal tyrant\" and a \"murderous dictator\" and cut off contact after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Just to drive home the point that everything had changed, Trump followed up yesterday's positive assessment of his talk with Putin with an upbeat early morning post on his platform, Truth Social, reflecting on \"great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday\". There was now a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!\"",
      "Putin is not just back in conversation with the most powerful country in the world. With Trump, he may now see himself as the arbiter of the endgame in the war he started when he broke international law with the all-out invasion of Ukraine almost exactly three years ago.",
      "At the White House, Trump seemed to suggest that the huge numbers of dead and wounded in the Russian military gave some kind of legitimacy to Putin's demand to keep the land captured and annexed by Russia.",
      "\"They took a lot of land and they fought for that land,\" Trump said. As for Ukraine, \"some of it will come back\".",
      "His defence secretary Pete Hegseth's remarks at a Nato meeting in Brussels were more direct. He wanted Ukraine to be \"sovereign and prosperous\". But \"we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective\".",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "Trump is still at the easy end of what could become an impossibly tough diplomatic challenge. Boasting that he has the key to ending the Russo-Ukraine war is one thing. Making that happen is something else.",
      "His declaration before any talks with Russia start that Ukraine will not join Nato nor get back all its occupied land has been widely criticised as a poor start by a man who claims to be the world's best dealmaker.",
      "The veteran Swedish diplomat and politician Carl Bildt posted an ironic rebuke on X.",
      "\"It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started. Not even Chamberlain went that low in 1938. That Munich ended very bad anyhow.\"",
      "Bildt posted a photo of Britain's then prime minister Neville Chamberlain on his return from Munich in 1938, waving the notorious and worthless agreement he had made with Adolf Hitler - the price of which was the capitulation and break-up of Czechoslovakia and a faster slide towards a second world war.",
      "After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Vladimir Putin was widely portrayed in the west as the new threat to European peace. Trump's approach to him is very different.",
      "He will have to try to bridge the gap between Putin and Zelensky's positions, which are polar opposites.",
      "Zelensky's declared objective is to regain Ukraine's lost territory, which amounts to around a fifth of its total land mass. He also wants Ukraine to become a full member of Nato.",
      "Putin insists that any peace deal would require Ukraine to give up the land Russia has captured, as well as areas it has not occupied, including the city of Zaporizhzhia which has a population of more than half a million. Ukraine would also become neutral, demilitarised and would never join Nato.",
      "Ukraine's demands will not be acceptable to Moscow, and Trump has indicated he doesn't like them either.",
      "But Russia's amount to an ultimatum, not a serious peace proposal. Trump, once a developer, likes deals that involve tangible real estate. But Putin wants more than land. He wants Ukraine to go back to the relationship it had with the Kremlin during the days when it was part of the Soviet Union. For that to happen, Ukraine would have to lose its independence and sovereignty.",
      "Biden offered Ukraine enough not to lose, because he took Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons if Nato intervened seriously. Trump must be aware of nuclear danger, but he also believes backing Ukraine indefinitely is a bad deal for the US, and he can do better.",
      "As for the Europeans, he might force them to face up to the gross disparity between their military promises to Ukraine and their military capabilities. Only Poland and the Baltic states are backing their public statements about the threat from Russia with qualitatively increased defence spending.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.",

      "Why Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "Productions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.",
      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "Many say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA.",
      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.",

They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",

      "It's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.",
      "On a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated.

      "\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.",
      "About a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.",
      "She laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.",

      "Officers said they were treating the incident as a suspected attack.",
      "Here's what we know about the attack so far.",
      "What happened?",
      "Munich police said the car, a Mini Cooper, accelerated and ploughed into the back of a rally by the Verdi trade union during a strike by public sector workers. It happened in Munich's city centre at the junction of Karlstrasse and Seidlstrasse at about 10:30 local time (11:30 GMT).",
      "Employees of day-care centres, hospitals, sanitation facilities and public swimming pools had joined the strike, calling for higher pay and longer holidays.",
      "At the time of the collision around 1,500 people were on their way to the rally's final location a short distance away.",
      "One shot was fired at the vehicle by police before the driver was detained at the scene.",
      "Emergency services had been in the area because of the rally allowing the suspect to be quickly arrested and for the injured to be treated, police said.",
      "It is unclear whether the suspect was injured.",
      "A police spokesman told local public broadcaster BR that police were checking whether there was a link between the demonstration and the incident.",
      "The crash happened hours before the US vice president and Ukrainian president were due to arrive in the city for the Munich Security Conference - but police say they don't believe it's related.",
      "How many were injured?",
      "At least 30 people were injured, including two seriously, German police said on Thursday.",
      "The local fire service said some of those hurt were in a \"life-threatening condition\".",
      "Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter said children were among those injured.",
      "According to Bavarian media, injured people were being treated at multiple hospitals around Munich, including a children's hospital and the Munich Red Cross Clinic.",
      "Some of the injured included employees of the Munich city administration, Munich's deputy mayor Dominik Krause said.",
      "Several participants at the trade union rally had brought their children with them, \"which makes the act even more heinous\", Krause said.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "The suspect, Farhad N, who we are not fully naming due to German privacy rules, is a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan.",
      "He resides in Munich, German police said, adding that his motive was unclear.",
      "\"It was probably an attack,\" Bavaria state premier Markus S\u00f6der told reporters.",
      "Bavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann said the suspect had his asylum application rejected, but he had not been forced to leave due to security concerns in Afghanistan.",
      "He later clarified that the suspect had a valid residence and work permit and that everything about him was legitimate.",
      "According to the the German Press Agency, the suspect came to Germany in 2016 as a minor.",
      "Herrmann said initially that the suspect had been known to police but later explained that he had previously worked as a store detective and had been a  witness in several cases of shoplifting.",
      "Bavarian state premier Markus S\u00f6der told German TV that counter-terrorism officials had taken over the inquiry but \"previous extremist backgrounds are not so easily recognisable at first glance\".",

      "Put simply, the current world security order \u2013 the catchily named International Rules-based Order \u2013 is in danger of crumbling. Some would argue this is already happening.",

Nato, the EU and the West in general reached an extraordinary level of unity in coming together to help Ukraine defend itself, without getting drawn into direct conflict with Russia.",
      "Barring some demurring from Slovakia and Hungary, there was a general consensus that Putin's invasion must be seen to fail or Nato itself would be critically weakened while Russia would eventually be tempted to invade another neighbouring country, such as Estonia. It was often said that Ukraine should be given whatever it took and for as long as it took in order to secure a lasting peace from a position of strength.",

      "President Trump has effectively pulled the rug out from Ukraine's negotiating position by conceding, via his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, that restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".",
      "The US has also dashed Kyiv's hopes of joining Nato, a key ambition of President Zelensky, and ruled out sending US troops to help protect its borders from the next time Russia decides to invade.",
      "An even greater shock has come with the news that President Trump held an apparently cordial 90-minute phone call with President Putin, thus abruptly ending the West's three-year freeze in talking to the Russian leader that has been in place since the time of the invasion.",
      "Over the next 72 hours we will be hearing in Munich from President Trump's team here in Munich what the details of their plan for Ukraine will be. Some of it is still to be worked out after his envoy, retired US Army General Keith Kellogg, travels to Kyiv next week.",
      "But for now, Nato's unity is badly dented as clearly there is a wide difference of opinion over Ukraine between Washington and Europe. One wants the war to end as quickly as possible, even if it means conceding to many of Moscow's demands.",
      "The other still believed, at least until this week, that with Russia losing around a thousand battlefield casualties a day and its economy facing dire long-term problems the best way to win a lasting peace would be to keep up the pressure on Moscow until it its army was exhausted and it agreed to peace terms more favourable to Ukraine.",

When Denmark's Prime Minister Frederiksson assured her population that \"Greenland is not for sale\" there followed what was called a \"horrendous\" phone call from Donald Trump who has not ruled out the use of force to take Greenland.",
      "The idea of one Nato country threatening to seize part of another Nato country's territory would have been unthinkable up until now. In Greenland's case there is no justification for it on security grounds since there are more US troops on Greenland than Danish and Copenhagen is happy to agree ways to boost mutual defence for the island.",
      "But even if nothing ever comes of this idea, and most of Scandinavia is dearly hoping that is the case, in some respects the damage has already been done. The message has gone out from the leader of the free world that its OK to threaten your neighbours by force if you want their territory.",
      "\"It may be,\" says Lord Kim Darroch, the former UK national security adviser and British Ambassador to Washington, \"that Trump's threat of economic measures against Nato ally Denmark, and his refusal to rule out military action against them, are just negotiating tactics.

And it will be interpreted in Moscow and Beijing as a message that they have a free hand in Ukraine and Taiwan respectively\".",

This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person.",
      "The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its \"thought process\" before delivering a response.",

      "Seated around a breakfast table in Erie, Pennsylvania, four veterans in their mid-80s - John, Jack, Bob and Don - gather to reminisce about their decades of friendship.",

      "Of the four, only Bob voted for Trump. But after seeing Elon Musk standing next to the Republican president in the Oval Office this week, defending his efforts to slash the size and spending of the federal government, he is already doubting his decision.",
      "\"I'm afraid of him,\" Bob says of Musk. \"I think he's trying to be president.\"",
      "Erie County was one of the key battlegrounds that helped swing the 2024 presidential election in Trump's favour. The Republican won 50.1% of the vote here just four years after his Democratic rival Joe Biden narrowly took the county.",
      "And part of Trump's winning platform was a clear promise to overhaul and upend the federal government, pledging on the campaign trail to deliver \"trillions\" in cuts if elected. Polls indicated that was popular with Republican voters, and that remains the case now.",
      "What was less clear to voters before the election was just how much of a frontline role Musk would play in this administration. The 53-year-old owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X now leads the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) which is dedicated to shrinking government and is routinely pictured alongside the president.",

    "story": [
      "A proposed law in Colombia's Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders.",
      "One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",

      "Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris.",
      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "summary": "The US president is ratcheting up pressure on South Africa over its domestic and foreign policy.",
    "story": [
      "South Africa appears to be at a crossroads in its waxing and waning relationship with the US following President Donald Trump's controversial decision last week to cut financial aid to the country.",
      "Trump said South Africa was pursuing what he called \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white minority Afrikaner community and by filing a genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.",
      "His move has sent shockwaves across South Africa, with experts fearing he may go on to use this opportunity to end preferential access to the US market through its special US-Africa trade programme known as the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).",
      "The two countries have generally had friendly relations since the end of white-minority rule in 1994 when anti-apartheid icon and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela was elected South Africa's first black president.",
      "Though it took the US another 14 years to remove Mandela from its \"terrorist watch list\" for his role in fighting the racist system of apartheid, which had been introduced by South Africa's then-Afrikaner rulers in1948.",
      "The latest tension flared up a few days after Trump's inauguration last month when South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Expropriation Bill, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.",
      "Trump's response came last week when he threatened to cut future funding over what he termed \"terrible things, horrible things\" the country's leadership was doing.",
      "The US president further accused South Africa, without any basis in fact, of \"confiscating land\" and \"doing things that are perhaps far worse than that\".",
      "He doubled down in the face of the South African government's vehement rebuttal and signed an executive order last Friday freezing aid.",
      "This adds up to nearly $440m (\u00a3353m) - the amount of aid reportedly allocated in 2023 - though the US embassy in South Africa has subsequently said that funding from Pepfar, an American programme countering the global spread of HIV, will not be affected, adding the caveat that \"not all Pepfar activities will resume\".",
      "South Africa is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Pepfar, which contributes about 17% to its HIV/Aids programme in which around 5.5 million people receive anti-retrovirals.",
      "In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of a \"shocking disregard of its citizens' rights\" and taking \"aggressive positions\" against the US and its ally Israel in its ICJ case.",
      "In addition to the aid freeze, Trump offered to help refugees from the Afrikaner community, who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers, to settle in the US.",
      "His stance has played into the hands of conservative Afrikaner lobby groups, including AfriForum and Solidarity, which want the government repeal what it calls \"race-based laws\" such as affirmative action and black economic empowerment.",
      "This chimes with views by Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who was born in South Africa. He questioned on X why Ramaphosa had \"openly racist ownership laws\".",
      "This is not the first time South Africa's land reform policy has drawn Trump's ire.",
      "In 2018, during his first presidency, he accused South African authorities of the \"large-scale killing of farmers\" and asked his then secretary of state to look into the matter of the government \"seizing land from white farmers\".",
      "While Trump's remarks sparked a backlash at the time, Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, told the BBC there had \"never been this kind of radical action taken to the point of an executive order being signed\".",
      "With their relationship now in a precarious state - both countries are weighing up their next move.",
      "On the trade front, Donald MacKay, CEO of Johannesburg-based trade consulting firm XA Global Trade Advisors, said that while the US was one of South Africa's biggest partners, it was not its \"closest trading partner\".",
      "South Africa exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese.",
      "It also the one of the largest exporters under Agoa, generating about $2.7bn in revenue in 2023, mostly from the sale of vehicles, jewellery and metals.",
      "\"Over the years, that relationship has waxed and waned. It's never been terribly strong [since white-minority rule ended in South Africa]. But at the same time, I think it also never deteriorated quite as much as it has in recent years and I don't think it's South Africa's fault,\" Mr MacKay told the BBC.",
      "But he admitted South Africa had done \"a lot\" in recent years to irritate the US.",
      "\"Those irritations get to accumulate and under President Trump\u2026 this is seen as an opportunity to put South Africa in its place.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden put the change in dynamics partly down to \"global shifts\" and \"new competition driving up against the US\" from the likes of China, India and Brazil.",
      "While experts spoke on the benefits of Agoa, which is coming up for review later this year, they agreed that the impact might not be as significant as some fear.",
      "Agoa was introduced in 2000 and it gives eligible sub-Saharan African countries duty-free access to the US for more than 1,800 products.",
      "Mr MacKay said he would be surprised if South Africa continued benefiting from this preferential agreement after the review.",
      "\"My instinct is, whatever the reason that Trump is upset with South Africa, at the moment Agoa would be the easiest mechanism to use to punish South Africa.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden added that even if agreement was not renewed, or South Africa ended up being excluded, those businesses currently benefiting from it would suffer short-term losses but would manage to bounce back in a few years.",
      "He said at the moment President Ramaphosa's government was opting for the diplomatic route - though the Trump administration's seeming lack of interest in diplomacy drastically reduced chances of success.",
      "This has probably not been helped by South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola blunt response on Wednesday to Trump's move, saying there was \"no chance\" that South Africa would withdraw its case against Israel at the ICJ.",
      "\"Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world, and the rule of law,\" Lamola told the Financial Times.",
      "South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, in his capacity as G20 president, has announced he will be sending a delegation around the world to clarify South Africa's domestic and foreign policies - with Washington being a key stop.",
      "South Africa assumed the presidency of the G20, a cohort of countries that meet to discuss global economic and political issues, in December last year, seeing it as an opportunity to bolster its international standing.",
      "But in a snub to South Africa, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he will not attend a G20 meeting of foreign ministers taking place next week in Johannesburg.",
      "\"My job is to advance America's national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism,\" he said.",
      "South Africa is part of Brics, and alliance of major developing countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China, that is attempting to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier nations of North America and Western Europe.",
      "Mr MacKay believes it will be difficult for South Africa and other nations to navigate relations with the US under \"the most unpredictable politician in the world\", suggesting that they will have to increasingly see Brics as an alternative partner.",
      "But significantly for South Africa, the European Union (EU), one of its largest trading partners, has reaffirmed its support for the country.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council - which sets the general political direction and priorities of the EU - posted on X on Monday that he had spoken to Ramaphosa by phone to highlight the \"EU's commitment to deepen ties with South Africa\".",
      "Should South Africa's charm offensive fail, Mr Van Heerden suggests the government could opt to \"negotiate hard\" and use the minerals it supplies to the US as a \"bargaining chip\".",
      "But he voices a warning: \"South Africa is going to have to think very carefully about how they play this chess game [where] the opening gambit has already been made by President Trump and Elon Musk.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 22:18:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite the high demand for domestic workers, they remain India's most vulnerable and exploited people.",
    "story": [
      "Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers.",
      "The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her.",
      "\"After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate,\" Smitha says.",
      "She was eventually paid \u2013 a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; \u00a39] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes \u2013 after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action.",
      "Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon.",
      "Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse.",
      "But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed.",
      "Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented.",
      "Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the \"most comprehensive policies for domestic workers\" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it.",
      "As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million.",
      "\"We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship,\" says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies.",
      "\"This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work.\"",
      "As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes.",
      "At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope.",
      "But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges.",
      "Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers.",
      "\"We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession,\" she says.",
      "That applies to employers too. \"They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility,\" Ms George says.",
      "The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not.",
      "Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. \"Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled,\" she adds.",
      "In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 \u2013 a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions.",
      "India has a \"moral obligation\" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work.",
      "Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict.",
      "Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo,\" she says. \"So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset.\"",

    "title": "Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "A judge accused the Trump administration of defying his orders, setting up a battle that could end up at the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "In the first weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump has wasted no time in flexing his political muscle. That much is clear.",
      "Since taking office in January, he has ordered the suspension of all new asylum claims, cancelled refugee resettlement, frozen government hiring and spending, gutted agencies established by Congress, moved to ban gender transition care for teenagers and offered a buyout deal for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "The whirlwind of unilateral action on his campaign promises has pushed the limits of presidential power \u2013 and prompted legal challenges from Democrats, unions and legal groups.",
      "So far the federal courts have been the only substantive roadblocks to Trump's agenda, as judges have temporarily suspended some of his most contentious actions, including a bid to end automatic citizenship for anyone born on US soil - a right established from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.",
      "But Trump is pressing on - and seems headed for a showdown with the judiciary that could eventually end in the highest court in the land. This week, a Rhode Island judge said the Trump administration was clearly and openly defying his court order to unfreeze billions in federal funds. The White House responded by saying that \"every action\" the president took was \"completely lawful\".",
      "Vance questions authority of US judges to challenge Trump",
      "Judge blocks Trump plan to put thousands of USAID staff on leave",
      "Judge blocks Trump's bid to restrict birthright citizenship",
      "If Trump's orders do reach the US Supreme Court, six of the nine justices there - including three appointed by Trump in his first term - are conservative. Just last term, the court issued a decision holding Trump, and all future presidents, largely immune from prosecution for official actions while in office.",
      "At the time, it was a landmark expansion of presidential authority. But some observers have suggested that Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his powers even further.",
      "Trump's move to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and dismantle the United States Agency for International Aid (USAID) could run afoul of the checks-and-balances system of US government.",
      "Congress, rather than the White House, holds the authority to control federal spending and taxation - what's known as \"the power of the purse\". Legislators also established USAID and lawsuits have been filed arguing that Trump has no legal authority to dismantle it and refuse to spend funds allocated by Congress.",
      "But if the high courts agree to uphold some of his sweeping executive actions, it could strengthen his ability to transform the government and enact policy changes without the help of Congress.",
      "And even if the courts rule against the president, says Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Manhattan Institute, those legal defeats might be politically advantageous.",
      "\"There could be political benefits to being challenged in court and then even losing in court because then you can run against judges and make political hay of it.\"",
      "There is another scenario, however. Trump could simply refuse to comply with any court that tries to stop his exercise of unfettered presidential power.",
      "In Oval Office comments on Tuesday, the president hinted that this might be an option, in his typically oblique way.",
      "\"We want to weed out the corruption,\" Trump said. \"And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that.\"",
      "\"Maybe we have to look at the judges,\" he continued. \"I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, was even more blunt.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he posted on the social media site X. That view was similar to one Vance expressed in a 2021 podcast, when he said that if Trump returned to power he should refuse to comply with any court order that prevented him from firing federal workers.",
      "Directly defying a court ruling, however, would cut against centuries of US history and amount to the opening skirmishes in a constitutional crisis that pits the president against the branch of government designed to establish and interpret the law of the land.",
      "\"My read is that President Trump is testing the outer boundaries of what he might be able to get away with, doing a lot of things that are blatantly against the law and maybe some things that are closer to the line,\" said Fred Smith, a professor at the Emory University School of Law.",
      "\"They are breaking a lot of norms,\" Mr Smith added of the nascent Trump administration. \"Why he is doing that, only he knows fully. But he is doing it.\"",
      "So far, Trump and his allies have made aggressive comments about unfavourable court decisions in the public and in legal filings, but have yet to be sanctioned for disobeying a court. When Trump was the target of multiple prosecutions over the past four years, he frequently questioned the legitimacy of the presiding judges, but his courtroom lawyers adhered to the law and legal procedures.",
      "The federal judge in Rhode Island, who had placed a temporary hold on another Trump order to freeze some federal spending, did warn in court filings Monday that the administration was violating his temporary restraining order but stopped short of finding them in contempt.",
      "Conservative legal scholar Ed Whelan wrote on X that it would be \"extremely grave\" for the Trump administration to defy a federal court order.",
      "\"I'm open to the argument that truly extraordinary circumstances (the makings of a wild hypothetical) might justify defiance,\" Mr Whelan wrote. \"But in our constitutional system there should be an overwhelming presumption in favour of executive-branch compliance with federal court orders.\"",
      "Should Trump disobey, and therefore delegitimise, the courts, the decision could come back to bite him when the time comes for the president to see his own lawful agenda enforced, some legal experts say. Democratic states like California, for instance, might be inclined to ignore White House directives and federal laws they don't like - and Trump would be hard pressed to use the courts to bring them to heel.",
      "\"If the executive decides it will obey some court orders but not others, it will find it won't get any court orders that it wishes to obey,\" said Philip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University Law School. \"I just don't think they thought that through.\"",
      "When Donald Trump redecorated the Oval Office to his liking in January, he reinstalled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson that had hung on the wall across from the Resolute Desk in his first term.",
      "The seventh US president is remembered for a critical moment of defiance against the United States Supreme Court. When the justices decided a dispute between the state of Georgia and Cherokee Indian governments in 1832, Jackson did not seem interested in following its direction.",
      "Jackson allegedly said of the Chief Justice's ruling, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"",
      "Nearly 200 years later, Trump himself has found himself on his own collision course with America's judiciary."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:31:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's plans for tariffs risk raising prices for items from cars to canned food.",
    "story": [
      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:44:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, remembers one cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Mathew. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",

    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "Pugilism has been a favored subject of artists and photographers since boxers first stepped into the ring. \"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\" an exhibit in West Palm Beach, Fla., captures this most combative of sports.",
    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",
      "... or Harry Benson's famous shot of a very young Muhammad Ali meeting the very young Beatles in a Miami gym on their first trip to the U.S., in 1964:",
      "Sherman said, \"Who would have thought that these five would be inside of this ring together, and this would become this iconic image of boxing and fame?\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 09:33:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:14:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Pertussis cases are on the rise again, after a dip following the winter holidays.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The National Institutes of Health says the cuts will save more than $4 billion a year, but critics say it puts potentially lifesaving research in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement. Collins said she called Kennedy \"to express my strong opposition to these arbitrary cuts in funding for vital research\" in the state.",
      "Cancer research, heart disease and more",
      "The vast majority of medical research in the U.S. is supported by NIH funding, which \"includes over 2,800 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions\" nationwide. Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",
      "The NIH justified the cutback as being similar to rates paid for these costs by other nonprofit foundations that subsidize medical research.",
      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "The former official said that artificially capping the rates below what they have negotiated with institutions ignores the work already done by health authorities to come up with current funding rates.",

    "summary": "The adult patient infected with bird flu has reported only conjunctivitis and no other symptoms.",
    "story": [
      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",
      "Owen Truesdell, a spokesperson for the health district, said there is currently no evidence of other dairy workers showing symptoms.",
      "\"Please note that this is an evolving situation and we will continue to communicate with reporters and the public when relevant new information is learned,\" Truesdell said in an email.",
      "Health officials have said for months that while the spread of the virus in animals warrants stepping up precautions for workers dealing with sick cows and birds, the risk to the general public remains low.",
      "\"This case involving cow-to-human spread of H5 in a person with higher-risk occupational exposure does not change CDC's risk assessment, which remains low for the public but is higher for people with occupational or recreational exposures,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Virologists have said that multiple key mutations would need to change in the virus before it could easily spread between humans, beyond the occasional dead-end spillovers seen so far from animals into humans.",
      "An analysis published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday found that one \"mammalian adaptation\" had been found in the virus from the D1.1-infected cows in Nevada last month, but said there was \"no evidence of onward transmission among humans.\"",
      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",

      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",
      "But there have also been three cases over the past year with an \"unknown\" exposure, where investigators were unable to track down a likely explanation for how people got sick.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",

      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",

      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",

      "Make a list of all your things",

    "summary": "The bird flu is still wiping out poultry flocks, leading to supply shortages. Here's when egg prices could come down, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's\u00a0five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",

      "On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.5%, versus economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase, according to FactSet. That's the biggest monthly jump since August 2023. It may be due to price increases set at the start of the year by many businesses, noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email.",

      "Recent sticky inflation data backs the Federal Reserve's decision last month to hit the brakes on additional rate cuts, economists say. On Feb. 11, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank does \"not need to be in a hurry\" to pare rates further.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Higher borrowing costs for longer: With the Fed pausing on additional rate cuts, consumers are likely to pay more for loans and other debt, ranging from credit cards to auto loans.",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If they succeed, CEOs and Wall Street will once again be free to trick, trap and cheat you,\" Warren stated in a videotaped post.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "summary": "A new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleges that Starbucks is unlawfully relying on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",

      "Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\" for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\"Maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn't scalable or sustainable,\" Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\"",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Google Maps: Gulf of America",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America's highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",

      "Google confirmed Monday that the Gulf of America name had gone into effect. Google Maps users in the U.S. now only see the Gulf of America name, whereas those in other countries see both names. Denali, however, still appears on both Google Maps and the GNIS.",
      "And the new names on Google Maps aren't the only change the company has made following recent actions from the Trump administration. Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives.

      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",

      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",

We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "Washington \u2014 A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with one seeking to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another aimed at stopping Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",
      "Over the weekend, Vought\u00a0ordered\u00a0the bureau's staff to halt almost all of their work, continuing the administration's ongoing blitz of the federal bureaucracy. Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",
      "\"CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have been directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any authorized type of leave,\" the NTEU said. \"It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to a purge of CFPB's workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency's statutory mission.\"",
      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles secured the championship in Sunday's Super Bowl 59, but there were also several winners \u2014 and plenty of losers \u2014 in the lineup of star-studded commercials that aired during the broadcast. The best Super Bowl LIX ads delivered strong messages, either through humor or drama, while the worst commercials left some viewers befuddled, experts said.",
      "There's a lot on the line for Super Bowl advertisers, with a few ad spots selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Last year, a 30-second spot\u00a0sold for about $7 million. Advertisers also spend additional millions on creating their ads, often hiring well-known actors or celebrities to appear in their spots.",
      "Super Bowl commercials that score can pay off for a company through new customers and a stronger brand image, but ads that fumble can tarnish a business's marketing message and even turn off consumers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who co-runs its annual Super Bowl ad ranking.",
      "The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\"That's the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn't the advertising you notice or remember.\"",
      "This year's crop of ads included some that dropped the ball, according to Northwestern marketing professor Derek Rucker, who co-runs the Kellogg ad review with Calkins.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Coffee Mate",
      "One of this year's worst ads was the spot from Coffee Mate, Kellogg's ad review found. That spot featured two men sitting on the couch when one of them puts Coffee Mate's cold foam on his drink. His tongue then leaps out of his mouth and dances along to music and fireworks.",
      "\"The brand showcased dancing tongues, which included jumping out of a person's mouth,\" Rucker told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The spot was distracting and the brand's message got lost as a result, he said.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Tubi",
      "Another commercial that was voted as one of this year's worst by the panel was the Tubi ad, Rucker said. That spot, for the Tubi streaming service, featured people with fleshy hat-like appendages, with the main character born with a cowboy-shaped head. The ad was \"good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,\" according to Collider.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: ChatGPT",
      "ChatGPT's ad was also a low-rated ad, according to Northwestern's ad panel. Its spot showed the evolution of human tech through black-and-white pixelated images, but the business school gave it poor marks because it didn't show viewers anything new. The ad cost $14 million to air in the first half, according to tech publication The Verge.",
      "\"It's understandable given that, with the amount of money invested in the spot, the audience really was given very little new information about ChatGPT. It's almost as if it simply showed up the party not knowing what to do,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Michelob Ultra",
      "This spot features actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara as they hustle younger players out of their Michelob Ultra beers by wagering that they can beat them at pickleball. \"Play you for an Ultra?\" O'Hara asks at the end of the commercial.",
      "\"Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara appeared together and showcased their hustle\u2014 and hustling\u2014 for Michelob Ultra. It's got just the right balance between brand and celebrity, and it resonated with our panel,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Google",
      "The Google ad featured a dad preparing for a job interview, who turns to Google's Gemini AI app to help him craft a description of the most challenging job he's had \u2014 being a dad.",

    "summary": "Organizations that receive funding from USAID and other agencies sued after they were cut off from federal funding for foreign assistance programs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while litigation moves forward, delivering yet another setback for the president as he seeks to make sweeping changes to the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali partially granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of organizations that receive funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and other agencies, but have since been cut off from federal dollars or had to suspend their work in the wake of Mr. Trump's executive action ordering a 90-day pause on foreign development aid.",
      "The nonprofit organizations argued that Mr. Trump's directive and a subsequent memorandum from Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued late last month, which temporarily stopped new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs and called for stop-work orders, was an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of executive power.",
      "They warned that the directive has \"created chaos in the funding and administration\" of USAID and other foreign assistance programs.",
      "\"One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\" lawyers for one group of challengers, led by the Global Health Council, wrote in a court filing.",
      "Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden, blocked top Trump administration officials from enforcing a pause on foreign assistance funded through the State Department or USAID without authorization and halting new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs pending a review. He also barred the administration from suspending contracts, grants or other foreign assistance awards that were in effect as of Jan. 19 and issuing stop-work orders in connection with foreign aid awards that were in existence before Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "The judge said at the current stage of litigation, the nonprofit organizations met their burden for temporary, emergency relief, but that their request was too broad. But Ali found the groups were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and made a \"strong preliminary showing that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm.\"",
      "\"Here, the stated purpose in implementing the suspension of all foreign aid is to provide the opportunity to review programs for their efficiency and consistency with priorities,\" Ali wrote. \"However, at least to date, Defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\"",
      "In a hearing held Wednesday, Stephen Wirth, a lawyer representing one group of seven nonprofits, said his clients have been \"devastated\" by Mr. Trump's executive order. He warned that as a result of the freeze on funding for foreign assistance programs, small businesses have been forced to shutter, food for starving populations abroad is rotting in ports and warehouses, and medical supplies are expiring.",
      "Additionally, at least one group, Democracy International, an international development company that conducts projects for USAID, has had to furlough all 95 of its U.S.-based workers and 93% of its employees working on USAID projects in overseas offices, Wirth said.",
      "The federal government, he said, is terminating contracts \"en masse.\"",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits said that organizations that receive foreign assistance grants have tried to draw down funding from USAID and the State Department, but have not been able to access their funds. In other instances, groups have had contracts terminated and pending invoices for completed work have not been paid, Wirth said.",
      "At least 230 USAID grants and contracts have been terminated or been subject to stop-work orders since Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers said in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its decision to issue the 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance allows it to ensure that the projects the U.S. is supporting align with the administration's foreign policy.",
      "Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general, said during the hearing that the issue is about how money that has been appropriated by Congress is being spent. He argued federal laws governing foreign assistance allow the president to determine how those funds should be used.",
      "He also noted that Rubio has approved a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance programs.",
      "The cases before Ali arose from recent efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul USAID, which was founded in 1961 and is an independent agency. Its operations have been in turmoil over the past few weeks amid the Trump administration's freeze on foreign assistance funding and stop-work orders for USAID contractors and agency partners. The administration also moved to shut down overseas USAID missions and recall thousands of employees living and working abroad. The administration last week\u00a0placed thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and closed the aid agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters to staff.",
      "But some of Mr. Trump's efforts have been stopped by another federal judge in Washington in a separate case brought by labor unions.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by Mr. Trump, temporarily prohibited the government from placing more than 2,000 employees on administrative leave. He also ordered the administration to reinstate employees already on leave and blocked expedited evacuations of USAID employees from their host countries.",

      "The House Budget Committee marked up its resolution on Thursday, one day after the Senate Budget Committee did the same. The House is pursuing one massive package, while the Senate plans to divide its work into two.",
      "But the chambers will have to approve identical budget resolutions to move forward with the reconciliation process, which allows them to avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. Going that route would allow Republicans to pass the legislation without any Democratic support. Under budget reconciliation, the package may only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit. And any new spending must be paid for.",
      "The Senate's resolution could come to the floor as early as next week. The House will be away on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when the lower chamber returns the following week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly insisted that the House take the lead on the reconciliation process, told reporters Thursday that \"there's a lot of discussion and debate and deliberation ahead of us.\" Still, he called the markup the \"necessary first start to get it going.\"",
      "\"We have a very diverse conference and we have to get everybody onboard,\" the Louisiana Republican said.",
      "What's in the House GOP proposal",
      "House Republicans have been at odds with their Senate colleagues, preferring to pass one major border and defense bill that also includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "The House resolution calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts and instructs more than a handful of committees to find ways to reduce the deficit, while increasing spending for several other issue areas.",
      "In a deal with conservatives, the House Budget Committee agreed to amend the budget resolution Thursday to secure the tax cut threshold. Under the agreement, if House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be lower than the proposed $4.5 trillion. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The panels tasked with finding the steepest cuts are the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is instructed to propose at least $880 billion in cuts; the Education and Workforce Committee, with at least $330 billion; and the Agriculture Committee, with a minimum of $230 billion.",
      "The resolution instructs the Judiciary Committee to propose up to $110 billion in additional spending, while the Armed Services Committee could propose $100 billion in new spending. The Homeland Security Committee would be allotted $90 billion.",
      "What's in the Senate GOP plan",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans have backed a two-bill strategy. The first is focused on border security, defense and energy priorities, while the second would include an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The Senate's first resolution would direct the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee to each propose no more than $175 billion in additional spending. The Armed Services Committee could propose $150 billion in new spending, while the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee would be allotted $20 billion and the Environment and Public Works Committee $1 billion.",
      "Several other committees would be instructed to find at least $1 billion in cuts.",
      "The resolution would increase annual spending by $85.5 billion, which would be paid for by the same amount in spending cuts, according to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who leads the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Graham said Wednesday during debate on the upper chamber's proposal that he's \"pulling for one big, beautiful bill, but there's a sense of urgency\" in approving immigration-related funding.",
      "\"I hope you will consider what we do if you cannot produce the one big, beautiful bill quickly,\" Graham said.",
      "House Freedom Caucus gets onboard",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction that has been a thorn in the side of Republican leaders, unveiled its own two-step plan on Monday as the House faced repeated delays in releasing its package. But Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday that with the amendment in place tying tax cuts to spending cuts, he expects members will support the budget resolution.",
      "GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Dakota and Chip Roy of Texas, two House Freedom Caucus members who were seen as potential roadblocks on the budget panel, came out in favor of the proposal during Thursday's hearing.",
      "\"This budget put forward by the chairman is a giant step forward to reduce spending,\" Roy said. \"I believe that it is responsible, and I believe it is a balance of what we're supposed to do.\"",
      "Harris outlined that the agreement will \"allow the flexibility to actually bring the tax cuts even higher\" if there's more spending cuts. In terms of where to find the cuts, Harris wouldn't point to specifics, deferring to the committees on where to find savings.",
      "The House GOP's estimates project an increase of $2.5 trillion in revenues due to economic growth sparked by the trillions in tax cuts. Harris called that a \"conservative\" estimate and said that \"when it all balances out, we believe that \u2026 it's actually going to result in deficit reduction.\"",
      "Asked whether the Freedom Caucus was still planning to release its own tax package, Harris said, \"No, this is it.\"",
      "\"We declare victory,\" Harris said, noting that the group was aiming for meaningful deficit reduction, and the ability to advance Mr. Trump's tax policy. \"We don't need another bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have hammered the Republican blueprints, questioning how the proposals will help everyday Americans struggling with the high cost of living.",
      "\"Republicans in the House and Senate have shown no interest in making life better for everyday Americans, because it's all about tax cuts for the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York told reporters Wednesday. \"The Republicans with their budget have betrayed the middle class.\"",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A lawsuit filed on Thursday by attorneys general from 14 states challenges the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access sensitive government data and exercise \"virtually unchecked power.\"",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues President Trump violated the appointments clause of the Constitution by creating a federal department without congressional approval.",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Mr. Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, before he departed, \u00a0saying they\u00a0aimed to cut about $500 billion\u00a0in annual expenditures.",
      "Musk's team has roamed from agency to agency, tapping into computer systems, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, while lawsuits pile up claiming Mr. Trump and DOGE are violating the law.",
      "The latest lawsuit details how, according to the state attorneys general, Musk has \"unraveled federal agencies, accessed sensitive data, and caused widespread disruption for state and local governments, federal employees, and the American people.\" It goes on to say DOGE \"endangers cybersecurity and erodes public trust.\"",
      "The New Mexico Department of Justice is leading the lawsuit with Arizona and Michigan as co-leads. Attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also joined the lawsuit.",
      "They asked the court to order Musk to identify ways that \"any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used,\" destroy \"such unauthorized access in his or DOGE's possession\" and bar Musk and DOGE from ordering changes in the disbursement of public funds, canceling government contracts, taking steps to dismantle agencies and more.",
      "On Thursday, Musk called for the U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" from the federal government as part of his push to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Democratic attorneys general say Musk's approach is generating profound concerns among their constituents about the secure handling of sensitive information at agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the IRS.",
      "\"Donald Trump seems to think a narrow electoral victory makes him into a king. He could not be more wrong,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. \"Worse still, Trump installed Elon Musk at the head of that agency without vetting and Senate confirmation, and Musk has proceeded to use that unconstitutional appointment to try to cut the federal government to the bone.\"",
      "New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said Mr. Trump is demonstrating \"weakness\" in deploying Musk rather than advancing his agenda through a Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "\"Move fast and breaking things may work in Silicon Valley for a tech company,\" Torrez said. \"It's not good governance and it's unconstitutional.\"",
      "The lawsuit seeks a court ruling declaring Musk's actions unconstitutional and wants his previous actions invalidated.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in New York temporarily\u00a0blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued the preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued Mr. Trump.",
      "Last month, a lawsuit from a public interest law firm called National Security Counselors accused DOGE of operating as a federal advisory committee, putting it in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",

He reiterated that point Thursday.",
      "\"Simply pointing out realism like the borders won't be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin,\" Hegseth said. \"It's a recognition of the hard power realities on the ground after a lot of investment and sacrifice.\"",

      "The U.S. has long had difficulty deporting migrants from Africa and Asia, due to the long distances involved in deportations to the Eastern Hemisphere and decisions by governments in those continents to limit or reject American deportations flights. The New York Times first reported Wednesday's deportation of Asian migrants.",
      "The flights also underscore how aggressively and quickly the Trump administration is moving to convince countries across the region to accept migrants who are difficult to deport, even though they are not citizens of their nations.",
      "The governments of El Salvador and Guatemala have already agreed to accept migrant deportees from the U.S. who are not from their countries. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has even offered to accept and detain suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who are expelled from the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed more deportation agreements, though it's unclear how many more arrangements will be agreed to. One plan that had been considered would have sent third-country nationals to the South American nation of Guyana, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Panama's willingness to accept the deportees also comes as Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in retaking control of the strategically important Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama in 1999. Panama's leaders have rejected the idea outright, and disputed claims by Mr. Trump and U.S. officials about China's influence on the canal's operations.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in his first international trip shortly after taking office, and the State Department said last week that the U.S. had reached a deal that would allow its military ships to transit the canal for free. Panama's president said no such deal had been reached and that the State Department's statement was \"based on a falsity.\"",
      "Representatives for the Departments of Homeland Security and State did not respond to requests to comment on the deportation flights to Panama.",
      "Like the U.S., Panama has faced significant migration challenges in recent years.",
      "The Dari\u00e9n Gap, a once-impenetrable roadless and mountainous jungle that divides Panama and Colombia, has become a busy transit route for migrants hoping to make their way through Central America and Mexico to enter the U.S.",
      "In 2023, more than half-a-million migrants, most of them from Venezuela, crossed the Dari\u00e9n jungle into Panama, a record. That number decreased to more than 300,000 in 2024, though that was still the second-highest annual tally recorded by Panamanian authorities.",

    "story": [
      "Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor resigned after attorneys in her office were directed to drop their criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, three sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Danielle Sassoon stepped down from her role as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York on Thursday, days after a top Justice Department official ordered her office to dismiss corruption charges against the mayor.",
      "On Monday, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the five-count indictment that was filed in September.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges,\" Bove wrote, adding that the department \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based,\" and \"in no way calls into question the integrity and efforts\" of the prosecutors who brought the case.",
      "Bove also cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies, and the case was to be dropped with prejudice, so the charges could be revived at a later time.",
      "In a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and reviewed by CBS News, Sassoon offered her resignation and said the request to drop Adams' case \"raises serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "Pushing back on Bove's directive to dismiss the mayor's case, Sassoon wrote she was \"baffled\" by the process and argued the basis behind the orders was not valid. And she alleged Adams was engaging in an \"an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.\"",
      "Sasson's letter to the attorney general alleged that during a meeting with Justice Department officials last month, Adams' attorneys \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. Bove and Adams' legal team both rejected this assertion.",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote. She also argued Bove's characterization of the timing of the indictment against Adams as politically motivated was wrong.",
      "\"The Department of Justice correctly concluded that bringing charges nine months before a primary election was entirely appropriate,\" Sasson wrote in her letter, which was sent on Wednesday. She added that \"dismissing the case will amplify, rather than abate, concerns about weaponization of the Department.\"",
      "Sassoon wrote that federal prosecutors proposed adding a new charge against Adams, accusing him of allegedly destroying evidence and providing false statements to the FBI. She said those charges were never filed.",
      "Bove sent a strongly worded response to Sassoon Thursday, which was also reviewed by CBS News. He rejected many of Sasson's allegations and accepted her resignation as acting U.S. attorney. He accused her of losing sight of her oath and said that under Sassoon's leadership, \"the office has demonstrated itself to be incapable of fairly and impartially reviewing the circumstances of this prosecution.\"",
      "Bove admonished Sassoon for not following the directive. \"The Justice Department will not tolerate the insubordination and apparent misconduct reflected in the approach that you and your office have taken in this matter.\" He said that he and Justice Department leadership stood by the decision to drop Adams' case and Sassoon's refusal to comply interfered with the \"interests of justice.\"",
      "\"As a result of the pending prosecution, Mayor Adams is unable to communicate directly and candidly with City officials he is responsible for managing, as well as federal agencies trying to protect the public from national security threats and violent crime,\" Bove wrote. \"My directive to you reflected a determination by the Justice Department that these public safety risks greatly outweigh any interest you have identified.\"",
      "The line prosecutors who worked on Adams' case have been placed on paid leave, pending investigations into Sassoon's conduct, Bove's letter also revealed.",
      "In response to Sassoon's new allegations against Adams and his legal team, Alex Spiro, an attorney for the mayor, told CBS News, \"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"",
      "\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" Spiro said.",
      "Bove also rejected Sassoon's claims of a quid pro quo, writing, \"You have also strained, unsuccessfully, to suggest that some kind of quid pro quo arises from my directive. This is false, as you acknowledged previously in writing. The Justice Department is charged with keeping people safe across the country. Your office's job is to help keep the City safe. But your actions have endangered it.\"",
      "The acting heads of the Justice Department's criminal and public integrity divisions, Kevin Driscoll and his deputy, John Keller, also recently resigned from their posts at Justice Department headquarters in Washington in the wake of the Adams case, according to three separate people familiar with the moves.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Bove also cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies. The case was to be dropped without prejudice until the mayoral election later this year, pending a review by the U.S. attorney's office. So it's possible the charges could be revived at a later time.",
      "Adams was set to go to trial on the charges \u2014 which included bribery and campaign finance violations \u2014 in April. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's order, federal prosecutors in Sassoon's office had not yet complied with the directive on Thursday, a signal of a potential conflict between the office that filed the charges against Adams and the Trump administration's new leadership.",
      "Driscoll and Keller's departures also point to a growing rift within the Justice Department over the handling of the case.",
      "During a press conference on Wednesday, when the Justice Department announced a civil lawsuit against New York State officials, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was unaware that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York had not yet complied with Bove's order.",
      "Sassoon was appointed interim head of the office while President Trump's pick to be Manhattan's U.S. attorney, Jay Clayton, makes his way through the Ssenate confirmation process.",
      "Sassons's departure came after a number of Biden-appointed U.S. attorneys from across the country were fired from their positions this week, multiple sources confirmed to CBS News. Changes in top federal prosecutor jobs are customary and expected around the time of presidential transitions.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland agreed Thursday to temporarily halt President Trump's executive action that restricts access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19, according to the groups challenging the move, delivering a setback to the Trump administration efforts targeting what it calls \"gender ideology\" while the legal proceedings move forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Brendan Hurson issued a temporary restraining order from the bench following a hearing on their bid to temporarily block enforcement of the restrictions.",
      "The challengers have argued that the Trump administration's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status. Hurson's order prevents federal agencies from conditioning or withholding funds based on the fact that a medical provider offers gender-affirming care to a young patient.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive action requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure came on the heels of other executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to \"promote gender ideology\" and declares U.S. policy as recognizing only \"two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "The young people who are part of the lawsuit include two 12-year-olds who identify as transgender, and five transgender teenagers. All were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to court filings. Joining them in the case are the organizations PFLAG, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ people, and the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights.",
      "In their bid for the court to halt Mr. Trump's action, the challengers noted that hospitals around the country have abruptly halted medical care for transgender young people. In the case of one of the plaintiffs, identified in court papers as 14-year-old Gabe Goe, he and his parents were told that Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., would no longer issue new prescriptions or process refills for treatments to address his gender dysphoria.",
      "\"The orders gravely threaten transgender people in the United States by pitting the health and wellbeing of that vulnerable minority population against the health and wellbeing of countless others and millions of dollars in federal funding,\" the plaintiffs wrote in a court filing.",

      "\"This well-established authority dooms plaintiffs' likelihood of succeeding on their claim that the president exceeded his presidential authority in issuing the EOs,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing. \"Plaintiffs also are unlikely to succeed on their constitutional and statutory discrimination claims: the EOs do not discriminate based on sex or any other protected class, and they bear a substantial relationship to important governmental objectives regarding the protection of children and adolescents from potentially dangerous and ineffective treatments such that they satisfy any possible standard of constitutional scrutiny anyway.\"",

As the only Senator to have worked at Planned Parenthood, Tina quickly became a leader in Washington in the fight to protect women's rights. Tina also bravely shared her own story as part of her work to strengthen mental health services for all Americans. Her quiet but effective governing style earned her the title the velvet hammer.

      "Matthew Platkin, attorney general of New Jersey, which is leading the case, cheered the decision and said the states' coalition delivered for children who could be impacted by Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"President Trump may believe that he is above the law, but today's preliminary injunction sends a clear message: He is not a king, and he cannot rewrite the Constitution with the stroke of a pen,\" Platkin said in a statement.",
      "At least eight lawsuits have been filed in courts from coast to coast that challenge Mr. Trump's directive. His executive order came as part of an immigration crackdown\u00a0that he promised on the campaign trail. It denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful residents.",
      "The decisions from the federal judges against the Trump administration rely on an 1898 Supreme Court decision, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the court held that a man born in the U.S. to Chinese immigrants was a citizen by virtue of the Constitution.",
      "Sorokin, too, pointed to that 127-year-old decision, writing in his opinion that it \"leaves no room\" for the Trump administration's proposed reading of the Constitution's Citizenship Clause.",
      "He noted that the administration can seek to revisit that case, but that would be a matter for the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The rule and reasoning from that decision were reiterated and applied in later decisions, adopted by Congress as a matter of federal statutory law in 1940, and followed consistently by the Executive Branch for the past 100 years, at least,\" Sorokin wrote.",
      "Sorokin was considering the two requests for preliminary injunctions brought by the states, the nonprofit organizations and a pregnant woman whose baby is due in March. The woman, identified in court filings as O. Doe, lives in Massachusetts and plans to be in the U.S. when she gives birth. The woman is in the country with temporary protected status and the baby's father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, according to court filings.",
      "Pointing to the nonprofits and expectant mother, Sorokin said that what is at stake \"is a bedrock constitutional guarantee and all of its attendant privileges. The loss of birthright citizenship \u2014 even if temporary, and later restored at the conclusion of litigation \u2014 has cascading effects that would cut across a young child's life (and the life of that child's family), very likely leaving permanent scars.\"",

      "President Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general during his first week in office \u2014 from departments as varied as the U.S. Small Business Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs.",
      "On Wednesday,\u00a0eight of those ousted inspectors general filed a lawsuit\u00a0against Mr. Trump's administration, saying the terminations were \"unlawful and unjustified.\" Inspectors general named in the lawsuit include those from the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education.",
      "Court documents filed in Washington, D.C., district court state those inspectors general conduct and facilitate oversight of more than $5 trillion of appropriated funds annually and more than 3.5 million federal employees.",
      "But what exactly is an inspector general and what do they do?",
      "What is an inspector general?",
      "On October 12, 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act, which established twelve Federal Offices of Inspector General tasked with rooting out fraud and waste and providing non-partisan recommendations at government agencies. There are now more than 70 statutory inspectors general\u00a0appointed either by the president or by agency heads.",
      "They are non-partisan public servants who serve during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Most federal agencies \u2014 ranging from the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education to other federal entities such as Amtrak, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Smithsonian Institution \u2014 have an Office of Inspector General, or OIG.",

      "Inspectors general are mandated to conduct independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections, according to the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The Inspector General Act specifically directs inspectors general to investigate and audit programmatic activities run by the organization to ensure funds are being directed correctly, foster efficiency and prevent \"fraud and abuse in the programs administered by each agency.\"",
      "Inspectors general are independent, and while they are under the general supervision of the agency, by law, they can not be prevented from conducting an audit or investigation. Inspectors general report to their agency head and Congress, allegations of misconduct by their office are referred to the integrity committee of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.",
      "How is an inspector general appointed and can they be fired?",
      "Federal inspectors general can be appointed either by the president or by the agency head. The president nominates all inspectors general at Cabinet-level departments and agencies which then go through Senate confirmation. These include departments such as the Department of Defense, Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Federal entities not at Cabinet level, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, National Endowment for the Arts and United States Postal Service,\u00a0can appoint their inspectors general.",
      "The Inspector General Act specifies all are appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely based on integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration or investigations.",
      "A federal law passed in 2022 requires the president to notify Congress 30 days before the removal of an inspector general, as well as requiring a \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons.\"",
      "The law also designates that a \"first assistant\" would automatically replace an inspector general in the event of a vacancy, and the president needs to communicate reasons for not making a formal nomination to fill a vacant position after a certain period of time.",
      "What does an inspector general do?",
      "Inspectors general act as independent watchdogs within their organizations.",
      "They conduct investigations to root out fraud, abuse and other allegations, after which they file public reports on their assigned agencies.

    "summary": "The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, following weeks of questions surrounding whether the controversial nominee would win the Senate's approval.",
      "Senators voted 52 to 48 to confirm Kennedy. The vote fell largely along party lines, with one Republican \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2014 joining Democrats in opposing him. McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio, said in a statement that Kennedy \"failed to prove he is the best possible person\" for the post, while citing his record on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy was sworn in to the role by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during a ceremony at the White House later in the day.",
      "Kennedy, 71, is a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist whose family has mythic status in Democratic politics. The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy launched his own White House bid in 2023. And although he initially sought the Democratic nomination, Kennedy changed his bid to independent, before dropping out to endorse President Trump in August.",
      "Before entering politics, Kennedy worked for two decades as president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a nonprofit. He also founded Children's Health Defense, which has launched legal challenges against vaccine requirements and approvals, and served as its chairman beginning in 2016. Kennedy is married to actor Cheryl Hines. He has six children.",
      "With his confirmation, Kennedy will be at the helm of the sprawling HHS department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "RFK Jr.'s path to confirmation",
      "After Mr. Trump picked Kennedy for HHS secretary, pledging on the campaign trail to let him \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine, Kennedy's confirmation initially appeared to be on shaky ground. With controversial stances on vaccines and abortion, Kennedy garnered opposition from both sides of the aisle. Then, a pair of\u00a0confirmation hearings featuring tense exchanges with several senators did little to quiet concerns about his path to confirmation, with little wiggle room among Republicans to advance his nomination out of committee.",
      "As it became clear Kennedy would not find support among Democrats on the committee, the vote to advance his nomination came down to a single Republican \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 whose vote would tip the scale in either direction. Cassidy, a medical doctor, had expressed consternation over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "In a surprise move moments ahead of the committee vote, however, Cassidy said he would support Kennedy, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed \"that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship,\" speaking multiple times a month.",
      "\"He will be the secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner,\" Cassidy said.",
      "After Kennedy's nomination advanced out of committee, Republican opposition in the full Senate also appeared to dissipate. Two senators who are among the few Republicans who have voted to oppose any of the president's nominees, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, announced they would support Kennedy's confirmation this week. And on Wednesday, all Republicans voted to advance his nomination in a procedural vote that fell along party lines.",
      "The final vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary came after weeks of pushback by Democrats, who warned of the widespread impact Kennedy could have on the health system. Senate Democrats spent hours on the Senate floor vocalizing their opposition to his confirmation Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which was the committee that voted on advancing Kennedy's nomination, called him an \"anti-vaccine crusader\" and the \"least qualified nominee to ever be nominated for a position of this importance.\"",
      "\"Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle still have an opportunity to turn away from a dangerous path,\" Wyden said on Wednesday. \"If they do not, my view is their legacy will be tarnished by setbacks in science that will echo in America for decades.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote Thursday morning that he's \"proud\" that every Democrat will oppose Kennedy's nomination, arguing that if the Senate held a vote on Kennedy under a secret ballot, \"Mr. Kennedy would never come close to becoming confirmed.\"",
      "\"Many if not most Republicans would vote against him,\" Schumer continued. \"But sadly and unfortunately for America, Republicans are being strong-armed by Donald Trump and will end up holding their nose and voting to confirm Mr. Kennedy.\"",
      "In his statement explaining why he voted against Kennedy, McConnell cited his history with polio, saying that in his lifetime he's \"watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world.\" The former GOP leader added that he \"will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures.\"",
      "\"Individuals, parents, and families have a right to push for a healthier nation and demand the best possible scientific guidance on preventing and treating illness,\" McConnell said. \"But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts.\"",
      "During his opening statement to the Senate Finance Committee last month, Kennedy said that \"Americans' overall health is in a grievous condition,\" citing high obesity, diabetes and cancer rates, among other conditions on the rise, while pledging to deliver on his and Mr. Trump's promise to \"make America healthy again.\"",
      "\"I promised President Trump that if confirmed I will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\" Kennedy said.",

      "Musk offered a wide-ranging survey via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, of what he described as the priorities of the Trump administration interspersed with multiple references to \"thermonuclear warfare\" and the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "In remarks similar to ones he made in the Oval Office Tuesday\u00a0with the president looking on, Musk said, \"We really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\" Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \"Tech Support.\" He also joked that he was the \"White House's tech support,\" borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",

      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Mr. Trump's blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That's included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role gave his comments more weight beyond being the world's wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\"A lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\" Musk said, referring to Mr. Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \"There's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I'm like, 'O.K. Well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?'\"",
      "He added that the U.S. under Mr. Trump is \"less interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\"",
      "There are \"times the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\" Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\" he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\"If hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there's too many men in power and execute them,\" Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \"kind of scary.\" He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\"",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \"Dubai Loop\" project in line with his work in the Boring Company - which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit. However, he and the Emirati government official speaking with him offered no immediate details of the plan.",

    "story": [
      "A top-ranking scientist at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Lawrence Tabak, was forced to retire this week, multiple people familiar with the move say, marking the highest-profile departure of a health official under the Trump administration so far this year.",
      "Tabak's retirement, which he told colleagues was effective Tuesday, ends a decades-long tenure serving at the federal medical research agency, including multiple years as the acting director of the NIH during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also served as the agency's top ethics official.",
      "An email circulated among NIH staff from Tabak did not explain why he was abruptly stepping down, which multiple people familiar with the decision said came earlier than he was planning. One person said he did not plan to retire until at least the fall.",
      "Tabak told one federal researcher that he said he \"found it necessary to retire today from federal service.\" A former colleague said Tabak, who should have been the second-in-command at the agency, had been excluded from key meetings.",
      "Tabak and spokespeople for the National Institutes of Health did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "\"He has helped shape important policy decisions at NIH over four administrations. He has guided NIH through complex issues and will be sorely missed,\" acting NIH Director Dr. Matthew Memoli said in an email Wednesday afternoon to NIH staff announcing the retirement.",
      "The departure follows years of intense scrutiny of Tabak from Republican lawmakers at multiple congressional hearings, when he faced questioning over issues like the agency's oversight of \"gain-of-function\" research on viruses, which can make them more dangerous and is supposed to be tightly controlled, as well as grants to the EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services found in a review of grants dating back to 2014 that the NIH missed opportunities to avoid paying for $89,171 in costs to the groups that should not have been allowed, like vague employee bonuses. It also faulted the NIH for not doing more to ensure its funds did not go towards gain-of-function research.",
      "Tabak's retirement also comes amid ongoing court battles over a decision last week to make steep cuts to the amount of money for facilities and administration costs that the federal government has agreed to pay for in medical research.",
      "A federal judge has for now temporarily blocked those cuts nationwide, pending further arguments in lawsuits brought by medical colleges, universities and state attorneys general.",
      "Several scientists have come out to praise Tabak, who was often tasked as the agency's principal deputy director to handle difficult problems at the NIH.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:57:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:44:00 -0500",
    "summary": "By switching the next space station crew to a different ferry ship, the Starliner astronauts will get home a bit earlier than planned.",
    "story": [
      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",
      "But the Biden administration had no known influence on NASA's decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission, a plan that has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 spacecraft was launched with a two-man crew and two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "And in any case, there was no need to \"go get\" the astronauts given the Crew 9 spacecraft, the Starliner crew's ride home, has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov now plan to blast off around 7:48 p.m. EDT on March 12.",
      "The launch date depends on a variety of factors, including an on-schedule launch of a commercial moon lander from the same pad on Feb. 26 and, of course, the weather.",

    "summary": "Endangered Mexican long-nosed bats are now being tracked via \"eDNA\" using their saliva.",
    "story": [
      "Flagstaff, Arizona \u2014 Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive.",
      "Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders.",
      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:57:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",

      "Time to prepare",

Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",

      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:44:00 -0500",
    "summary": "By switching the next space station crew to a different ferry ship, the Starliner astronauts will get home a bit earlier than planned.",
    "story": [
      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",
      "But the Biden administration had no known influence on NASA's decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission, a plan that has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 spacecraft was launched with a two-man crew and two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "And in any case, there was no need to \"go get\" the astronauts given the Crew 9 spacecraft, the Starliner crew's ride home, has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov now plan to blast off around 7:48 p.m. EDT on March 12.",

    "summary": "Organizations that receive funding from USAID and other agencies sued after they were cut off from federal funding for foreign assistance programs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while litigation moves forward, delivering yet another setback for the president as he seeks to make sweeping changes to the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali partially granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of organizations that receive funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and other agencies, but have since been cut off from federal dollars or had to suspend their work in the wake of Mr. Trump's executive action ordering a 90-day pause on foreign development aid.",
      "The nonprofit organizations argued that Mr. Trump's directive and a subsequent memorandum from Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued late last month, which temporarily stopped new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs and called for stop-work orders, was an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of executive power.",
      "They warned that the directive has \"created chaos in the funding and administration\" of USAID and other foreign assistance programs.",
      "\"One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\" lawyers for one group of challengers, led by the Global Health Council, wrote in a court filing.",
      "Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden, blocked top Trump administration officials from enforcing a pause on foreign assistance funded through the State Department or USAID without authorization and halting new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs pending a review. He also barred the administration from suspending contracts, grants or other foreign assistance awards that were in effect as of Jan. 19 and issuing stop-work orders in connection with foreign aid awards that were in existence before Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "The judge said at the current stage of litigation, the nonprofit organizations met their burden for temporary, emergency relief, but that their request was too broad. But Ali found the groups were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and made a \"strong preliminary showing that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm.\"",
      "\"Here, the stated purpose in implementing the suspension of all foreign aid is to provide the opportunity to review programs for their efficiency and consistency with priorities,\" Ali wrote. \"However, at least to date, Defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\"",
      "In a hearing held Wednesday, Stephen Wirth, a lawyer representing one group of seven nonprofits, said his clients have been \"devastated\" by Mr. Trump's executive order. He warned that as a result of the freeze on funding for foreign assistance programs, small businesses have been forced to shutter, food for starving populations abroad is rotting in ports and warehouses, and medical supplies are expiring.",
      "Additionally, at least one group, Democracy International, an international development company that conducts projects for USAID, has had to furlough all 95 of its U.S.-based workers and 93% of its employees working on USAID projects in overseas offices, Wirth said.",
      "The federal government, he said, is terminating contracts \"en masse.\"",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits said that organizations that receive foreign assistance grants have tried to draw down funding from USAID and the State Department, but have not been able to access their funds. In other instances, groups have had contracts terminated and pending invoices for completed work have not been paid, Wirth said.",
      "At least 230 USAID grants and contracts have been terminated or been subject to stop-work orders since Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers said in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its decision to issue the 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance allows it to ensure that the projects the U.S. is supporting align with the administration's foreign policy.",
      "Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general, said during the hearing that the issue is about how money that has been appropriated by Congress is being spent. He argued federal laws governing foreign assistance allow the president to determine how those funds should be used.",
      "He also noted that Rubio has approved a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance programs.",
      "The cases before Ali arose from recent efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul USAID, which was founded in 1961 and is an independent agency. Its operations have been in turmoil over the past few weeks amid the Trump administration's freeze on foreign assistance funding and stop-work orders for USAID contractors and agency partners. The administration also moved to shut down overseas USAID missions and recall thousands of employees living and working abroad. The administration last week\u00a0placed thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and closed the aid agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters to staff.",
      "But some of Mr. Trump's efforts have been stopped by another federal judge in Washington in a separate case brought by labor unions.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by Mr. Trump, temporarily prohibited the government from placing more than 2,000 employees on administrative leave. He also ordered the administration to reinstate employees already on leave and blocked expedited evacuations of USAID employees from their host countries.",

      "Washington \u2014 House and Senate Republicans are racing to keep pace on competing budget proposals to enact President Trump's top priorities, with committees in both chambers voting to advance their respective plans this week.",
      "The House Budget Committee marked up its resolution on Thursday, one day after the Senate Budget Committee did the same. The House is pursuing one massive package, while the Senate plans to divide its work into two.",
      "But the chambers will have to approve identical budget resolutions to move forward with the reconciliation process, which allows them to avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. Going that route would allow Republicans to pass the legislation without any Democratic support. Under budget reconciliation, the package may only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit. And any new spending must be paid for.",
      "The Senate's resolution could come to the floor as early as next week. The House will be away on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when the lower chamber returns the following week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly insisted that the House take the lead on the reconciliation process, told reporters Thursday that \"there's a lot of discussion and debate and deliberation ahead of us.\" Still, he called the markup the \"necessary first start to get it going.\"",
      "\"We have a very diverse conference and we have to get everybody onboard,\" the Louisiana Republican said.",
      "What's in the House GOP proposal",
      "House Republicans have been at odds with their Senate colleagues, preferring to pass one major border and defense bill that also includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "The House resolution calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts and instructs more than a handful of committees to find ways to reduce the deficit, while increasing spending for several other issue areas.",
      "In a deal with conservatives, the House Budget Committee agreed to amend the budget resolution Thursday to secure the tax cut threshold. Under the agreement, if House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be lower than the proposed $4.5 trillion. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The panels tasked with finding the steepest cuts are the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is instructed to propose at least $880 billion in cuts; the Education and Workforce Committee, with at least $330 billion; and the Agriculture Committee, with a minimum of $230 billion.",
      "The resolution instructs the Judiciary Committee to propose up to $110 billion in additional spending, while the Armed Services Committee could propose $100 billion in new spending. The Homeland Security Committee would be allotted $90 billion.",
      "What's in the Senate GOP plan",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans have backed a two-bill strategy. The first is focused on border security, defense and energy priorities, while the second would include an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The Senate's first resolution would direct the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee to each propose no more than $175 billion in additional spending. The Armed Services Committee could propose $150 billion in new spending, while the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee would be allotted $20 billion and the Environment and Public Works Committee $1 billion.",
      "Several other committees would be instructed to find at least $1 billion in cuts.",
      "The resolution would increase annual spending by $85.5 billion, which would be paid for by the same amount in spending cuts, according to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who leads the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Graham said Wednesday during debate on the upper chamber's proposal that he's \"pulling for one big, beautiful bill, but there's a sense of urgency\" in approving immigration-related funding.",
      "\"I hope you will consider what we do if you cannot produce the one big, beautiful bill quickly,\" Graham said.",
      "House Freedom Caucus gets onboard",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction that has been a thorn in the side of Republican leaders, unveiled its own two-step plan on Monday as the House faced repeated delays in releasing its package. But Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday that with the amendment in place tying tax cuts to spending cuts, he expects members will support the budget resolution.",
      "GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Dakota and Chip Roy of Texas, two House Freedom Caucus members who were seen as potential roadblocks on the budget panel, came out in favor of the proposal during Thursday's hearing.",
      "\"This budget put forward by the chairman is a giant step forward to reduce spending,\" Roy said. \"I believe that it is responsible, and I believe it is a balance of what we're supposed to do.\"",
      "Harris outlined that the agreement will \"allow the flexibility to actually bring the tax cuts even higher\" if there's more spending cuts. In terms of where to find the cuts, Harris wouldn't point to specifics, deferring to the committees on where to find savings.",
      "The House GOP's estimates project an increase of $2.5 trillion in revenues due to economic growth sparked by the trillions in tax cuts. Harris called that a \"conservative\" estimate and said that \"when it all balances out, we believe that \u2026 it's actually going to result in deficit reduction.\"",
      "Asked whether the Freedom Caucus was still planning to release its own tax package, Harris said, \"No, this is it.\"",
      "\"We declare victory,\" Harris said, noting that the group was aiming for meaningful deficit reduction, and the ability to advance Mr. Trump's tax policy. \"We don't need another bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have hammered the Republican blueprints, questioning how the proposals will help everyday Americans struggling with the high cost of living.",
      "\"Republicans in the House and Senate have shown no interest in making life better for everyday Americans, because it's all about tax cuts for the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York told reporters Wednesday. \"The Republicans with their budget have betrayed the middle class.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Texas man who killed his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled onto death row to threaten a lawmaker, was executed Thursday night.",
      "Richard Lee Tabler, 46, was given a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. The time of death was 6:38 p.m. CST, 15 minutes after a lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital was administered in his arms.",
      "\"There is not a day that goes by that I don't regret my actions,\" Tabler said, strapped to the death chamber gurney, looking at relatives of his victims who watched through a window a few feet away.",
      "\"I had no right to take your loved ones from you, and I ask and pray, hope and pray, that one day you find it in your hearts to forgive me for those actions,\" Tabler said. \"No amount of my apologies will ever return them to you.\"",

      "After apologizing several more times and saying this was the beginning of a new life for him in heaven, he told the warden: \"I am finished.\"",
      "As the drugs began, he mouthed once again, \"I'm sorry,\" then began breathing quickly. After about a dozen breaths, all movement stopped.",
      "Tabler \u2014 the second person executed in Texas in a little over a week, with two more scheduled by the end of April \u2014 was condemned for the Thanksgiving 2004 shooting deaths of Mohammed-Amine Rahmouni, 28, and Haitham Zayed, 25, in a remote area near Killeen in Central Texas.",
      "Rahmouni was the manager of a strip club where Tabler worked until he was banned from the place. Zayed was a friend of Rahmouni, and police said both men were killed in a late-night meeting to buy some stolen stereo equipment that was actually a planned ambush.",
      "Tabler also confessed to killing two teenage girls who worked at the club, Tiffany Dotson, 18, and Amanda Benefield, 16. He was indicted but never tried in their killings.",
      "Dotson's father, George, was among the witnesses. He declined to comment on Tabler's apologies, saying he needed time to process what he had just seen but was glad to have seen it.",
      "\"I couldn't wait,\" he said. \"It took me 20 years to get here.\"",
      "\"Today is for Tiffany,\" said her godfather, Tom Newton. \"And this is justice.\"",
      "Tabler had repeatedly asked the courts that his appeals be dropped and that he be put to death. He also has changed his mind on that point several times, and his attorneys have questioned whether he is mentally competent to make that decision. Tabler's prison record includes at least two instances of attempted suicide, and he was previously granted a stay of execution in 2010.",
      "\"Petitioner has spent the last twenty years in the Courts, and see's no point in wasting this Courts time, nor anyone else's,\" Tabler wrote to the state Court of Criminal Appeals on Dec. 9, 2024 after his current execution date was set.",
      "Tabler's death row phone calls in 2008 to state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston, prompted an unprecedented lockdown of more than 150,000 inmates in the the nation's second-largest prison system. Some were confined to their cells for weeks while officers swept more than 100 prisons to seize hundreds of items of contraband, including cellphones.",
      "Whitmire led a Senate committee with oversight of state prisons, and said at the time that Tabler warned him that he knew the names of his children and where they lived. Whitmire, through a spokesperson at the mayor's office, declined to comment on Tabler's pending execution.",
      "The ACLU appealed Tabler's case to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, claiming he was denied adequate legal representation during his lower court appeals by attorneys who refused to participate in hearings at what they said was his request.",
      "The ACLU appeal argued that Tabler's attorneys ignored a psychological exam that determined he had a \"deep and severe constellation of mental illnesses \" that had been ignored since childhood. The court refused to halt his execution.",
      "The club Tabler worked at was called TeaZers. Investigators said he had a conflict with his boss, Rahmouni, who allegedly said he could have Tabler's family \"wiped out\" for $10.",
      "Tabler recruited a friend, Timothy Payne, a soldier at nearby Fort Cavazos, and lured Rahmouni and Zayed to a meeting under the guise of buying the stolen stereo equipment. Tabler shot them both in their car, then pulled Rahmouni out and had Payne video him shooting Rahmouni again.",
      "Tabler later confessed to the killings. During the sentencing phase of his trial, prosecutors introduced Tabler's written and videotaped statements saying he also killed Dotson and Benefield days later because he was worried they would tell people he killed the men.",

      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again.

      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",

      "\"That's something that was stated as part of my remarks here as part of a coordination with how we're executing these ongoing negotiations, which are led by President Trump. All of that said, these negotiations are led by President Trump. Everything is on the table.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Hegseth, in addition to casting doubt on Ukraine's ability to join NATO, also said that a return to its pre-2014 borders \u2014 before Russia's first invasion resulting in the annexation of Crimea \u2014 was not a realistic goal for any negotiated settlement. He reiterated that point Thursday.",
      "\"Simply pointing out realism like the borders won't be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin,\" Hegseth said. \"It's a recognition of the hard power realities on the ground after a lot of investment and sacrifice.\"",
      "Biden administration officials, too, had cautioned against hopes for a full restoration of Ukraine's territory. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said at the beginning of 2023 that \"for this year it would be very, very difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces from all \u2014 every inch of Ukraine and occupied \u2014 or Russian-occupied Ukraine.\"",
      "Russia today controls about 20% of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. The U.S. and most of the world do not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea.",
      "There have been hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides of the war that will soon enter its third year, and the past few months have favored Russia's ability to keep expending large numbers of troops on the front lines to make slow and steady gains in eastern Ukraine.",
      "The Biden administration contributed about $66 billion in military weapons and equipment to Ukraine, and the U.S. government still has about $3.8 billion in presidential drawdown authority to commit more weapons from current Defense Department stocks to Ukraine.",
      "Hegseth said Thursday that any future assistance to Ukraine, \"either less or more, could be on the table in, in negotiations as well.\"",
      "\"I'm not going to I'm not going to be involved in those intimate diplomatic negotiations,\" Hegseth said. \"That's for the pros atop the Trump administration who do diplomacy and negotiations.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr. Trump said of Ukraine that aid could depend on a trade deal giving the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" he said. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",

The two also fielded questions on Mr. Trump's deportation program, tariffs and ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
      "Mr. Trump declined to say what Russia should give up in negotiations to end its war in Ukraine, nearly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "\"Maybe Russia will give up a lot. Maybe they won't,\" he said. \"The negotiation really hasn't started.\" He reiterated that he did not believe that Ukraine could be a member of NATO, suggesting that Ukraine provoked Russia by trying to join the military alliance.",
      "The president also revealed that he expects China to catch up to Russia and the U.S. as a nuclear power \"soon.\"",
      "\"He's building a very strong nuclear power,\" Mr. Trump said of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \"He's not very close to Russia and the United States right now, but he will be soon. He'll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to meet with Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the future to talk about denuclearization.",
      "\"The whole world is on fire. I have to put out the fires,\" he said. \"But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China, I'm going to meet with Russia, and we're going to see if we can deescalate it, we can bring it down military, especially as it pertains to nuclear.\"",
      "in his opening remarks, Mr. Trump said, \"There is truly a special bond between the United States and India, the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy.\"",
      "He also announced that the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries \"will be working together like never before to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.\"",
      "He also said they had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. the leading supplier to India.

      "Trump, Modi stress united front, even as Trump announces new reciprocal tariffs",
      "Trade and tariffs were expected to top the agenda during Modi's visit, and the Indian prime minister is hoping to avoid the brunt of the president's new tariffs. Mr. Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are scheduled to go into effect next month. Ahead of Modi's visit, Mr. Trump said there would be no exceptions or exemptions.",
      "With tariffs looming, Mr. Trump said it was \"very important that we remain united as countries.\"",
      "\"We're friends and we're going to stay that way,\" he said alongside Modi in the Oval Office.",
      "For his part, Modi congratulated the president on his election victory, and expressed hope that the partnership between the two countries would continue to strengthen.",

      "\"They charge more tariffs than any other country,\" Mr. Trump said of India on Thursday, adding that whatever tariffs India imposes on the U.S., the U.S. will impose on India.",
      "Last year, Mr. Trump called India, the most populous country in the world, a \"big tariff abuser.\"",

      "During his first term, Mr. Trump had a strong relationship with Modi and received a warm welcome from the Indian people when he visited in 2020. Whether the president plans to make exceptions to any tariffs for India could show the strength of where their relationship stands now.",

They included adults and families with children from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran and Uzbekistan, according to the documents.",
      "Another U.S. military flight to Panama planned for Thursday is expected to deport more Asian migrants, in addition to some African deportees. The documents show they include migrants from Cameroon.",
      "In a statement Thursday, Panama's foreign ministry confirmed it received on Wednesday the first flight under an agreement with the Trump administration that allows the U.S. to deport non-Panamanians to the Central American country.",
      "The ministry said Wednesday's deportation flight included 119 deportees from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The costs of the deportations under the agreement will be covered by the U.S., the ministry added.",
      "The deportations to the Central American country, a corridor for the mass migration that has gripped the region in recent years, represent a significant diplomatic win for President Trump and his government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The U.S. has long had difficulty deporting migrants from Africa and Asia, due to the long distances involved in deportations to the Eastern Hemisphere and decisions by governments in those continents to limit or reject American deportations flights. The New York Times first reported Wednesday's deportation of Asian migrants.",
      "The flights also underscore how aggressively and quickly the Trump administration is moving to convince countries across the region to accept migrants who are difficult to deport, even though they are not citizens of their nations.",
      "The governments of El Salvador and Guatemala have already agreed to accept migrant deportees from the U.S. who are not from their countries. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has even offered to accept and detain suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who are expelled from the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed more deportation agreements, though it's unclear how many more arrangements will be agreed to. One plan that had been considered would have sent third-country nationals to the South American nation of Guyana, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Panama's willingness to accept the deportees also comes as Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in retaking control of the strategically important Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama in 1999. Panama's leaders have rejected the idea outright, and disputed claims by Mr. Trump and U.S. officials about China's influence on the canal's operations.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in his first international trip shortly after taking office, and the State Department said last week that the U.S. had reached a deal that would allow its military ships to transit the canal for free. Panama's president said no such deal had been reached and that the State Department's statement was \"based on a falsity.\"",

      "The couple's 22-month-old daughter witnessed the killings while strapped in a seat in the family's open pickup truck. She survived an 18-hour ordeal before workers came upon the scene and found the girl covered in her mother's blood and suffering from numerous insect bites, according to investigators.",

      "First state execution in 2025",
      "Ford's execution was the first in Florida in 2025. One person was put to death in 2024, down from six in 2023, when Gov. Ron DeSantis was campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination. During the previous three years, the governor didn't sign off on any executions. He signed Ford's death warrant in January.",

Kimberly Malnory was beaten, raped and then shot with the same rifle, authorities had said.",
      "Ford initially told investigators that the Malnorys were alive when he left them to go hunting, suggesting someone else killed them. Prosecutors said in a court filing that there was \"overwhelming proof that Ford was responsible for the murders and the rape.\"",
      "The rifle was found later in a ditch near where Ford's truck had run out of gas and prosecutors presented DNA evidence at his trial connecting him to both slayings. The jury voted 11-1 to recommend the death penalty in the killings, to which the trial judge agreed.",

    "summary": "The former acting New York U.S. attorney said Adams' attorneys had offered \"what amounted to a quid pro quo\" \u2014 helping the U.S. with immigration enforcement \"in exchange for dismissal of his case.\"",
    "story": [
      "Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor resigned after attorneys in her office were directed to drop their criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, three sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Danielle Sassoon stepped down from her role as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York on Thursday, days after a top Justice Department official ordered her office to dismiss corruption charges against the mayor.",
      "On Monday, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the five-count indictment that was filed in September.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges,\" Bove wrote, adding that the department \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based,\" and \"in no way calls into question the integrity and efforts\" of the prosecutors who brought the case.",
      "Bove also cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies, and the case was to be dropped with prejudice, so the charges could be revived at a later time.",
      "In a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and reviewed by CBS News, Sassoon offered her resignation and said the request to drop Adams' case \"raises serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "Pushing back on Bove's directive to dismiss the mayor's case, Sassoon wrote she was \"baffled\" by the process and argued the basis behind the orders was not valid. And she alleged Adams was engaging in an \"an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.\"",
      "Sasson's letter to the attorney general alleged that during a meeting with Justice Department officials last month, Adams' attorneys \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. Bove and Adams' legal team both rejected this assertion.",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote. She also argued Bove's characterization of the timing of the indictment against Adams as politically motivated was wrong.",
      "\"The Department of Justice correctly concluded that bringing charges nine months before a primary election was entirely appropriate,\" Sasson wrote in her letter, which was sent on Wednesday. She added that \"dismissing the case will amplify, rather than abate, concerns about weaponization of the Department.\"",
      "Sassoon wrote that federal prosecutors proposed adding a new charge against Adams, accusing him of allegedly destroying evidence and providing false statements to the FBI. She said those charges were never filed.",
      "Bove sent a strongly worded response to Sassoon Thursday, which was also reviewed by CBS News. He rejected many of Sasson's allegations and accepted her resignation as acting U.S. attorney. He accused her of losing sight of her oath and said that under Sassoon's leadership, \"the office has demonstrated itself to be incapable of fairly and impartially reviewing the circumstances of this prosecution.\"",
      "Bove admonished Sassoon for not following the directive. \"The Justice Department will not tolerate the insubordination and apparent misconduct reflected in the approach that you and your office have taken in this matter.\" He said that he and Justice Department leadership stood by the decision to drop Adams' case and Sassoon's refusal to comply interfered with the \"interests of justice.\"",
      "\"As a result of the pending prosecution, Mayor Adams is unable to communicate directly and candidly with City officials he is responsible for managing, as well as federal agencies trying to protect the public from national security threats and violent crime,\" Bove wrote. \"My directive to you reflected a determination by the Justice Department that these public safety risks greatly outweigh any interest you have identified.\"",
      "The line prosecutors who worked on Adams' case have been placed on paid leave, pending investigations into Sassoon's conduct, Bove's letter also revealed.",
      "In response to Sassoon's new allegations against Adams and his legal team, Alex Spiro, an attorney for the mayor, told CBS News, \"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"",
      "\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" Spiro said.",
      "Bove also rejected Sassoon's claims of a quid pro quo, writing, \"You have also strained, unsuccessfully, to suggest that some kind of quid pro quo arises from my directive. This is false, as you acknowledged previously in writing. The Justice Department is charged with keeping people safe across the country. Your office's job is to help keep the City safe. But your actions have endangered it.\"",
      "The acting heads of the Justice Department's criminal and public integrity divisions, Kevin Driscoll and his deputy, John Keller, also recently resigned from their posts at Justice Department headquarters in Washington in the wake of the Adams case, according to three separate people familiar with the moves.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Bove also cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies. The case was to be dropped without prejudice until the mayoral election later this year, pending a review by the U.S. attorney's office. So it's possible the charges could be revived at a later time.",
      "Adams was set to go to trial on the charges \u2014 which included bribery and campaign finance violations \u2014 in April. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's order, federal prosecutors in Sassoon's office had not yet complied with the directive on Thursday, a signal of a potential conflict between the office that filed the charges against Adams and the Trump administration's new leadership.",
      "Driscoll and Keller's departures also point to a growing rift within the Justice Department over the handling of the case.",

    "summary": "As many as three-quarters of U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, a significant risk as weather disasters intensify.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of Californians who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires last month are now grappling with insurance claims. And with research showing that extreme weather today\u00a0poses a threat to nearly half of all U.S. homes, it's important to know exactly how much coverage you have so that when disaster strikes, you're not left standing in the rubble.",
      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",
      "Your home insurance policy should also cover possessions, also known as contents insurance. To be sure you're fully covered, make a list of all of your belongings, along with their estimated value. Update the list every year and let your agent know about any large purchases, from jewelry to cars.",
      "\"Most people don't even know they have contents insurance as part of their insurance policy,\" Thompson said. \"See how much it is.\"",
      "When to call Fema",
      "If you find yourself in the middle of a crisis while underinsured, you can contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 800-621-3362 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific time seven days a week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also may be able to provide assistance and negotiate with your insurance company.",
      "What if you think you're underinsured?",
      "If after reading your policy and calculating your coverage you determine you're underinsured, but your insurance provider insists that you're fine, Thompson suggests having them put that in writing.",
      "\"Ask them to actually put it in writing \u2014 an email or something back to you that is official saying that you are adequately insured,\" she said. \"You must have it in writing and in some way that you can easily access it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland agreed Thursday to temporarily halt President Trump's executive action that restricts access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19, according to the groups challenging the move, delivering a setback to the Trump administration efforts targeting what it calls \"gender ideology\" while the legal proceedings move forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Brendan Hurson issued a temporary restraining order from the bench following a hearing on their bid to temporarily block enforcement of the restrictions.",
      "The challengers have argued that the Trump administration's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status. Hurson's order prevents federal agencies from conditioning or withholding funds based on the fact that a medical provider offers gender-affirming care to a young patient.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive action requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure came on the heels of other executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to \"promote gender ideology\" and declares U.S. policy as recognizing only \"two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "The young people who are part of the lawsuit include two 12-year-olds who identify as transgender, and five transgender teenagers. All were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to court filings. Joining them in the case are the organizations PFLAG, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ people, and the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights.",
      "In their bid for the court to halt Mr. Trump's action, the challengers noted that hospitals around the country have abruptly halted medical care for transgender young people. In the case of one of the plaintiffs, identified in court papers as 14-year-old Gabe Goe, he and his parents were told that Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., would no longer issue new prescriptions or process refills for treatments to address his gender dysphoria.",
      "\"The orders gravely threaten transgender people in the United States by pitting the health and wellbeing of that vulnerable minority population against the health and wellbeing of countless others and millions of dollars in federal funding,\" the plaintiffs wrote in a court filing.",
      "In arguing that the president's orders are unlawful and unconstitutional, the plaintiffs said Mr. Trump does not have the power to unilaterally withhold funds that have been authorized by Congress and signed into law.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, said the president has the authority to direct agencies to implement his agenda.",
      "\"This well-established authority dooms plaintiffs' likelihood of succeeding on their claim that the president exceeded his presidential authority in issuing the EOs,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing. \"Plaintiffs also are unlikely to succeed on their constitutional and statutory discrimination claims: the EOs do not discriminate based on sex or any other protected class, and they bear a substantial relationship to important governmental objectives regarding the protection of children and adolescents from potentially dangerous and ineffective treatments such that they satisfy any possible standard of constitutional scrutiny anyway.\"",

The challengers have argued that Mr. Trump's executive order, issued on his first day in office, violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"The Constitution confers birthright citizenship broadly, including to persons within the categories described in the EO,\" Sorokin, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote in a 31-page decision.",
      "Sorokin joins federal judges in Maryland, Washington and New Hampshire that have issued preliminary injunctions blocking the Trump administration from enforcing the birthright citizenship executive order. The Justice Department has appealed two of those decisions to federal appeals courts in San Francisco and Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Matthew Platkin, attorney general of New Jersey, which is leading the case, cheered the decision and said the states' coalition delivered for children who could be impacted by Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"President Trump may believe that he is above the law, but today's preliminary injunction sends a clear message: He is not a king, and he cannot rewrite the Constitution with the stroke of a pen,\" Platkin said in a statement.",
      "At least eight lawsuits have been filed in courts from coast to coast that challenge Mr. Trump's directive. His executive order came as part of an immigration crackdown\u00a0that he promised on the campaign trail. It denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful residents.",
      "The decisions from the federal judges against the Trump administration rely on an 1898 Supreme Court decision, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the court held that a man born in the U.S. to Chinese immigrants was a citizen by virtue of the Constitution.",
      "Sorokin, too, pointed to that 127-year-old decision, writing in his opinion that it \"leaves no room\" for the Trump administration's proposed reading of the Constitution's Citizenship Clause.",
      "He noted that the administration can seek to revisit that case, but that would be a matter for the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The rule and reasoning from that decision were reiterated and applied in later decisions, adopted by Congress as a matter of federal statutory law in 1940, and followed consistently by the Executive Branch for the past 100 years, at least,\" Sorokin wrote.",
      "Sorokin was considering the two requests for preliminary injunctions brought by the states, the nonprofit organizations and a pregnant woman whose baby is due in March. The woman, identified in court filings as O. Doe, lives in Massachusetts and plans to be in the U.S. when she gives birth. The woman is in the country with temporary protected status and the baby's father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, according to court filings.",
      "Pointing to the nonprofits and expectant mother, Sorokin said that what is at stake \"is a bedrock constitutional guarantee and all of its attendant privileges. The loss of birthright citizenship \u2014 even if temporary, and later restored at the conclusion of litigation \u2014 has cascading effects that would cut across a young child's life (and the life of that child's family), very likely leaving permanent scars.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general during his first week in office.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general during his first week in office \u2014 from departments as varied as the U.S. Small Business Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs.",
      "On Wednesday,\u00a0eight of those ousted inspectors general filed a lawsuit\u00a0against Mr. Trump's administration, saying the terminations were \"unlawful and unjustified.\" Inspectors general named in the lawsuit include those from the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education.",
      "Court documents filed in Washington, D.C., district court state those inspectors general conduct and facilitate oversight of more than $5 trillion of appropriated funds annually and more than 3.5 million federal employees.",
      "But what exactly is an inspector general and what do they do?",
      "What is an inspector general?",
      "On October 12, 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act, which established twelve Federal Offices of Inspector General tasked with rooting out fraud and waste and providing non-partisan recommendations at government agencies. There are now more than 70 statutory inspectors general\u00a0appointed either by the president or by agency heads.",
      "They are non-partisan public servants who serve during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Most federal agencies \u2014 ranging from the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education to other federal entities such as Amtrak, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Smithsonian Institution \u2014 have an Office of Inspector General, or OIG.",
      "The Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, an independent entity in the executive branch tasked with improving and increasing professionalism in OIGs, keeps an updated list of OIGs, which also indicates if an office is vacant.",
      "Inspectors general are mandated to conduct independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections, according to the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The Inspector General Act specifically directs inspectors general to investigate and audit programmatic activities run by the organization to ensure funds are being directed correctly, foster efficiency and prevent \"fraud and abuse in the programs administered by each agency.\"",
      "Inspectors general are independent, and while they are under the general supervision of the agency, by law, they can not be prevented from conducting an audit or investigation. Inspectors general report to their agency head and Congress, allegations of misconduct by their office are referred to the integrity committee of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.",
      "How is an inspector general appointed and can they be fired?",
      "Federal inspectors general can be appointed either by the president or by the agency head. The president nominates all inspectors general at Cabinet-level departments and agencies which then go through Senate confirmation. These include departments such as the Department of Defense, Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Federal entities not at Cabinet level, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, National Endowment for the Arts and United States Postal Service,\u00a0can appoint their inspectors general.",
      "The Inspector General Act specifies all are appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely based on integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration or investigations.",
      "A federal law passed in 2022 requires the president to notify Congress 30 days before the removal of an inspector general, as well as requiring a \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons.\"",
      "The law also designates that a \"first assistant\" would automatically replace an inspector general in the event of a vacancy, and the president needs to communicate reasons for not making a formal nomination to fill a vacant position after a certain period of time.",
      "What does an inspector general do?",
      "Inspectors general act as independent watchdogs within their organizations.",
      "They conduct investigations to root out fraud, abuse and other allegations, after which they file public reports on their assigned agencies. Paul Martin, the former USAID inspector general, filed a report detailing the impact of the Trump administration's cuts to the agency \u2014 finding nearly $500 million in food aid was at risk of spoiling as it sat in ports, ships and warehouses after the funding cuts.",

    "summary": "The lawsuit claims that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the hippo attack his wife, the tour guides walked away without helping the couple.  The company denies the lawsuit's allegations.",
    "story": [
      "A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.",
      "Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides \u2014 including at least one armed with a rifle \u2014 walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"We're doing this because this should never have happened,\" said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. \"There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating.\"",
      "Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews.",
      "The Manders, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter.",
      "Phone and email messages were left for African Portfolio.",
      "The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.",
      "\"It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful,\" Gould said. \"I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.\"",
      "He added, \"My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components.\"",
      "Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manders signed for the trip.",
      "Email messages were left for Chiawa and its attorney.",
      "The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are \"inherently dangerous activities\" because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe.",
      "The suit alleges that African Portfolio \"encouraged and/or permitted\" the Manders to be exposed to an \"avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.\" It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience.",
      "African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manders before and during the attack, the suit alleges.",
      "Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 11 feet long and about 5 feet tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 7,000 pounds.",
      "Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.",
      "In 2018, a Chinese tourist and a local fisherman were killed in hippo attacks on the same day in Kenya.",
      "Lisa Manders suffered \"significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish\" before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness.",
      "\"He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life,\" Slager said. \"And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable.\"",
      "Last year, two American women were also killed by elephants in Zambia. In June 2024, officials said\u00a0Juliana Gle Tourneau, 64, of New Mexico, was killed when an elephant that was part of a herd the tourists were watching attacked their vehicle in the Zambian city of Livingstone.",
      "In March 2024, Gail Mattson, a 79-year-old Minnesotan,\u00a0was killed during a game drive in Zambia's Kafue National Park. In that incident, an elephant charged a truck, flipped it over, killed the tourist, and injured five others.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 10:58:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Archaeologists say the remnants of an ancient Roman basilica unearthed in the heart of London are \"one of the most significant discoveries\" in years.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of London's earliest-known ancient Roman basilica on the site of a planned 32-story skyscraper, right in the heart of what was once known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished to make way for the the new tower at 85 Gracechurch Street uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations over three feet wide, 13 feet deep and almost two millennia old.",
      "Sophie Jackson of the Museum of London Archaeology called it \"one of the most significant discoveries\" in years in British capital's oldest quarter, the City of London \u2014 the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and much earlier structures.",
      "The scientists say they have uncovered the foundations of a two-story building that was almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded the British isles and roughly 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.",
      "The basilica was part of the forum, the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London, or Londinium, as it was called, where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance.",
      "\"We're talking about the early stages of London here,\" said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. \"But it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy.\"",
      "Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center.",
      "Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the \"absolutely massive\" foundations discovered in several test pits dug by archaeologists suggests an \"extraordinary\" level of preservation of the building ruins.",
      "Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses \u2014 even ancient trash \u2014 could offer glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners.",
      "Property developers in Britain routinely have to bring in archaeologists as consultants as part of the construction planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Anglo-Saxon jewelry and remains and medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims.",
      "The latest discovery adds to the traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of the ancient wall that once surrounded Londinium, a portion of an amphitheater and a temple to the god Mithras that lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg.",
      "\"We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,\" Henderson-Schwartz said. \"But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.\"",
      "Elsewhere in England, archaeologists have recently discovered a \"mysterious lump\" of a purple substance that in Roman times would have been worth more than gold, and a stash of coins worth over $125,000 dating back to the reign of Emperor Nero.",

      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Elon Musk called Thursday to \"delete entire agencies\" from the U.S. government as part of his push under President Trump to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Musk offered a wide-ranging survey via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, of what he described as the priorities of the Trump administration interspersed with multiple references to \"thermonuclear warfare\" and the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "In remarks similar to ones he made in the Oval Office Tuesday\u00a0with the president looking on, Musk said, \"We really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\" Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \"Tech Support.\" He also joked that he was the \"White House's tech support,\" borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Mr. Trump's blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That's included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role gave his comments more weight beyond being the world's wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\"A lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\" Musk said, referring to Mr. Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \"There's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I'm like, 'O.K. Well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?'\"",
      "He added that the U.S. under Mr. Trump is \"less interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\"",
      "There are \"times the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\" Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\" he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\"If hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there's too many men in power and execute them,\" Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \"kind of scary.\" He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\"",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \"Dubai Loop\" project in line with his work in the Boring Company - which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit. However, he and the Emirati government official speaking with him offered no immediate details of the plan.",
      "\"It's going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\"",

    "summary": "Of the 124 journalists and media workers who were killed in 2024, 82 were killed in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.",
    "story": [
      "A record number of journalists were killed in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said\u00a0in a report released Wednesday. At least 124 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide, and about two-thirds of them were Palestinians who were killed by Israel during its war against Hamas in Gaza, the CPJ said.",
      "The previous record was 113 journalists killed, in 2007, during the Iraq War.",
      "Other countries including Sudan, Pakistan, Mexico and Syria also had multiple cases of journalists killed last year, the report found.",
      "The CPJ considers a journalist or media worker someone who covered news or commented on public affairs, in any medium. To be included on its list, the person's death must have been work-related. The deaths can be deliberate or accidental, such as if a journalist is killed in a conflict zone. A journalist's death would not be included if there is evidence they were \"inciting violence with imminent effect or directly participating as\u00a0combatants\u00a0in armed conflict at the time of their deaths,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ says it only includes confirmed cases in its report, meaning it found evidence indicating the journalist was killed in connection with their work; it says it considers all war-zone cases as confirmed.",
      "Increased global conflict leads to record deaths",
      "Of the 124 journalists who were killed in 2024, the CPJ report said 82 were killed amid the war in Gaza\u00a0and three were\u00a0killed in Lebanon, where Israel was fighting Hezbollah. In at least 10 cases, CPJ says its investigation determined they were \"deliberately targeted.\" The group says it continues investigating whether at least 20 other cases may have been deliberate.",
      "Thirty-one of the journalists killed in Gaza were Palestinian freelancers who the CPJ said \"stepped in to fill the information void after many news outlets ceased to operate\" in the territory.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, the Israel Defense Forces said it \"takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists\" and that it \"has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.\"",
      "The IDF sent a list of about half of a dozen \"so-called journalists named in CPJ's reports who've been found to have actively participated in and led terror efforts against Israel,\" including at least two whom it accused of directly participating \"in the October 7th massacre\" orchestrated by Hamas.",
      "Israel's military has frequently alleged that \"terror operatives\" in Gaza have doubled as journalists and could therefore be \"legitimate military targets,\" including some who've worked for Al Jazeera. The Qatari network has strongly denied this allegation.",
      "The uptick in journalist deaths comes amid a rising number of conflicts globally, the CPJ said. The other journalist killings in 2024 occurred in over a dozen countries, including Sudan, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "Sudan and Pakistan saw six journalist killings each, while Mexico had five. Four journalists were killed in Syria. Three died in Myanmar, where underground reporters are \"increasingly treated as enemy combatants,\" according to the CPJ. Another three journalist deaths were recorded in Iraq, marking the first journalist deaths there since 2020. Two journalists were killed in Haiti, where \"gangs now openly claim responsibility for journalist killings,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ said that it found countries where journalists are deliberately killed often try to \"bury evidence of killings, shift blame, and avoid accountability.\" Such actions put surviving journalists in even more danger, the group said, and remove \"the possibility of justice\" for those who have died.",
      "Around the world, journalists have also been intimidated, censored and arrested or assaulted. Such incidents were reported in Cameroon, Somalia and Afghanistan, even though there were no journalists killed in those countries. There were also no journalist deaths in the war between Ukraine and Russia, though several possibly targeted attacks left reporters injured, the CPJ said. A\u00a0Ukrainian journalist who was detained in August 2023 died in Russian custody last year.",

    "summary": "The number of shark attacks, including deadly bites, dropped substantially worldwide in 2024, according to a new report.",
    "story": [
      "Shark attacks \u2014 particularly deadly ones \u2014 dropped substantially last year around the world, a new report shows.",
      "The latest iteration of the\u00a0International Shark Attack File, a database run by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida, showed that shark attacks decreased dramatically in 2024 and was far below the annual average.",
      "\"Unprovoked shark bites plummeted in 2024,\" reads the headline of the report, which characterized the year as \"exceptionally calm\" for shark bites.",
      "Of 88 alleged shark-human interactions that researchers say they investigated last year, 71 bites were confirmed. The report segmented those incidents into unprovoked and provokes bites, of which there were 47 and 24, respectively. Seven of the attacks were fatal, including four unprovoked attacks, according to the research.",
      "Those figures did not account for instances where sharks attacked a boat or bit a human who was already dead. Several additional incidents where a person's injuries could not be indisputably attributed to a shark, over another predatory marine creature, were categorized as \"unconfirmed\" in the report.",
      "Confirmed attacks in 2024 dwarfed numbers reported in the previous year's International Shark Attack File, which recognized 91 global incidents, including 69 unprovoked bites and 22 provoked bites. Ten people died in shark attacks in 2023, with six killed in unprovoked attacks, researchers said at the time.",
      "The number of attacks last year was \"well below\" the 10-year average, of about 70 unprovoked shark bites recorded annually, the new report notes. It also calls the four unprovoked attacks a \"significant reduction\" compared with previous years.",
      "Our annual shark bite report for 2024 is now available online. There were only 47 unprovoked attacks, down 21 from the previous year and well below the 10-year average of 70.\ud83d\udcc9 Full story and data: https://t.co/yTWdm0F4GLSummary report: https://t.co/K18ueW2TLg pic.twitter.com/5QMBsXNdlr",
      "The International Shark Attack File considers attacks on a living human in the shark's natural habitat, who did not bother the animal prior to being bitten, \"unprovoked.\" It considers attacks that occur after a human has initiated some sort of contact with the shark \"provoked.\"",
      "Divers suffering bites after trying to touch or otherwise harass sharks, attacks on spearfishermen, bites on people who attempted to feed sharks, and bites that happen while a shark is being unhooked or removed from a fishing net, are some examples of scenarios that would meet criteria for a \"provoked\" attack.",
      "Unprovoked bites are of particular interest to the researchers studying shark attack patterns.",
      "\"We're interested in the natural patterns of shark behavior so that we can understand why people occasionally get bitten by these animals,\" said Gavin Naylor, the director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, in a statement. \"Any cue or attribute that modifies an animal's natural behavior is something that, we as scientists, want to exclude.\"",
      "Places with the most unprovoked shark attacks",
      "Most of 2024's unprovoked shark attacks happened in the United States, which follows a longstanding pattern, the new report notes. Last year, there were 28 confirmed shark bites in U.S. waters, accounting for 60% of the worldwide total despite being lower than the 36 unprovoked incidents confirmed in 2023.",
      "Half of U.S. attacks took place in Florida in 2024, which is also common for the state often known to experience the highest concentrations of shark bites of anywhere in the world. Like the national total, unprovoked shark bites were down in Florida, where the five-year average is 19 unprovoked attacks.",
      "Australia trailed the U.S. total with nine unprovoked bites, a sizable decrease from the country's five-year average of 15. Egypt, the Maldives, Western Sahara, the Turks and Caicos Islands, French Polynesia, Mozambique, India, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Belize each reported one unprovoked shark attack.",
      "The fatal attacks occurred in the U.S., Egypt, the Maldives and Western Sahara, with one death confirmed in each place, according to the Shark Attack File. Despite Florida's tally of unprovoked bites, the only U.S. death in a shark attack last year happened in Hawaii when surfer Tamayo Perry was killed off the island of Oahu. The species of shark involved in that attack is unknown, researchers said.",

    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

      "\"But a voice is not just a sound. And I\u2019d like to think that no matter how much an AI version of Moe or Snake or Chief Wiggum will sound like my voice, something will still be missing \u2014 the humanness.

      "AI expert Marva Bailer told Fox News Digital, \"When we look at animated characters, there is a person behind that character and there's also a person behind the voice, because we identify the character with the image, but also that unique voice and voices aren't just reading a script. A voice has a personality to it and emotion and a connection. And so his point that he's trying to make is he's actually developing these characters over time, and he's developing them through his life experience.\"",

      "\"Something that AI does for us is if we have an idea or creativity, and we want to know what something sounds like or thinks like or looks like, and maybe we don't have it in our repertoire or our community, it can give us those inspirations,\" Bailer said. \"And that's really what Hank is bringing to the picture.\"",

This is not just a publicity stunt \u2014 it is transparent retaliation in response to allegations contained within a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint that Ms. Lively filed with the California Civil Rights Department. While this lawsuit will be dismissed, we are pleased that Mr. Wallace has finally emerged from the shadows, and that he too will be held accountable in federal court.\"",

      "Justin Baldoni alleges Blake Lively's intentions in filing a civil rights complaint instead of a lawsuit \"were deliberate.\"",
      "Lively, 37, initially filed a complaint against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department Dec. 21, accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment while working on \"It Ends With Us.\" She also claimed that after raising concerns, he, along with a crisis PR team, orchestrated a retaliation campaign aimed at ruining her career.",
      "Baldoni, 41, launched a website that included an amended version of his $400 million defamation lawsuit against his co-star and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, which included an updated suit and timeline of events to counter claims she was sexually harassed on set of the drama for which he served as director.",

By the time Lively actually filed a lawsuit against the Wayfarer Parties, the damage to the Wayfarer Parties was done by virtue of Lively\u2019s months of colluding with the New York Times on a false and malicious narrative unshielded by any privilege. Make no mistake: these actions were deliberate.\"",
      "Celebrity attorney Christopher C. Melcher exclusively told Fox News Digital Baldoni had \"a very good reason\" to make the claim that Lively's actions were intentional.",
      "\"Because it was just a request for the government to investigate and not a lawsuit against Baldoni, he had no right to subpoena witnesses or force Blake or Ryan to sit for a deposition,\" Melcher said. \"The suspicion is that she leaked this request for investigation to the media with all of these text messages on there so that she could garner public sympathy but not be exposed to any scrutiny for her allegations.\"",

      "Melcher specified the importance of Baldoni stating Lively \"never intended to file a civil lawsuit\" in his amended lawsuit shared online.",
      "\"Ordinarily, if somebody makes a false statement against somebody, it's defamation, and you can get sued,\" Melcher said. \"But if the statement is made in a lawsuit or in contemplation of an immediate suit being filed, it is protected under the litigation privilege \u2013 that's Civil Code, Section 47.",
      "\"So, California Civil Code, Section 47 says statements made by a party in the course of a lawsuit are not defamatory, they're not actionable. You can't sue for defamation. And that's been interpreted to mean, 'OK, well, literally, if you're filing tomorrow, and you're maybe given a press release or demand letter, you can be covered under that umbrella that has to be immediately contemplated.'",
      "\"So, this \u2018never intended\u2019 is the code word for him saying that the leaks to the press are not covered by this litigation privilege because they were not made in the context of a lawsuit, and so that's what gives him the right to sue. Otherwise, he would be blocked.\"",

      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",

      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

This includes your phone number, email and other contact details that allow them to reach you, as well as information like the celebrities you follow, your family members and even the type of content you engage with online to tailor the perfect attack. As scams become more sophisticated and reliant on loads of data, it\u2019s more important than ever to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal information.",
      "1. Vigilance in online dating: In the digital world, not everyone is who they claim to be. Be wary of potential romantic interests who ask for money or gifts or those who want to move the relationship along too quickly. Keep your personal and financial information private and never share it with someone you haven't met in person.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Verify the identity: Request additional information or proof to verify their identity, such as video chatting or meeting in person if possible. Exercise caution before getting emotionally invested in someone you haven't met in real life.",
      "3. Research and verify: Conduct an online search using the person's name, email address or phone number to see if any suspicious or fraudulent activities are associated with them.\u00a0Reverse image search their profile pictures to check if they are stolen from elsewhere on the internet. You can also reverse-search their phone number for free by following the instructions found\u00a0here.",
      "4. Privacy settings: Keep your social media profiles private so only those you trust can see what\u2019s going on in your life.",

      "6. Use reputable dating platforms: Stick to well-known and reputable dating websites or apps with security measures to help protect their users from scams. These platforms often have guidelines for safe online dating and report suspicious users.",
      "7. Invest in personal information removal services:\u00a0I highly recommend you remove your personal information that can be found on various people search sites across the web.

    "story": [
      "SpaceX's Starship exploded during an unmanned test flight. Debris from the explosion streaked through the sky, leaving people on the ground amazed and confused. (Greg Munch /TMX)",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",
      "Euclid blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on July 1, 2023, to begin a six-year mission to explore the dark universe.",
      "GIANT STELLAR NURSERY REVEALED IN NEW IMAGES FROM ESA'S SPACE TELESCOPE",
      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",
      "For most of the population out there, an Einstein Ring is an \"extremely rare phenomenon,\" the ESA said.",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE SPIES SPECTACULAR STAR BIRTH CLUSTER BEYOND THE MILKY WAY",

They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE CAPTURES PHOTOS OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPERNOVA EVER SEEN",
      "The text paragraph explains the principle behind the Einstein rings. (ESA)",
      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",
      "Over the course of the mission, scientists expect Euclid will reveal more about the role of gravity in the Universe, as well as the nature of dark energy and dark matter.",

      "Euclid will map over a third of the sky and observe billions of galaxies as far as 10 billion light-years away, ESA said. In doing so, scientists expect Euclid to find around 100,000 more strong lenses, though finding one so cosmically close to home and so spectacular, ESA added, \"is astonishing.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says scammers exploit fears, falsely claim computer issues to access your personal data.",
      "If there is one corporation that is targeted by scammers more than anyone else, it is Microsoft. From customer support scams to impersonation and phishing attacks, the company\u2019s services are constantly under threat. Recently, even Russia-sponsored hackers managed to breach Microsoft and steal sensitive information.",
      "While Microsoft services as a whole are prime targets, one that stands out is Teams. The collaboration tool is used by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it a goldmine for attackers. Hackers are using it to spread\u00a0phishing,\u00a0vishing and\u00a0quishing campaigns, relying on social engineering tactics to trick victims into sharing private and sensitive data.",

      "The rising attacks on Microsoft Teams users",
      "Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting Microsoft Teams users with\u00a0sophisticated attack methods. One such technique involves malicious GIF images that exploit worm-like vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to take over accounts and infiltrate chat sessions when the image is opened.",
      "Hackers also insert malware-laden files into chat threads, tricking users into downloading DLL files that enable system takeover. Phishing campaigns leverage compromised accounts or domains to send deceptive invitations, luring victims into downloading harmful files.",
      "Some attackers use email bombing and vishing, posing as tech support to overwhelm users with spam emails before tricking them into granting remote access. Compromised email addresses and stolen Microsoft 365 credentials provide another entry point for unauthorized access.",
      "Plus, external access settings in Microsoft Teams, which often allow outside users to initiate chats or meetings, can be exploited if not properly restricted. Another common tactic is sending phishing links through Teams chats, often disguised as invoices or payment notifications, leading to ransomware infections.",

      "Beware of fake jobs as well",
      "Scammers have been running fake job schemes for a while, but their tactics keep evolving. Lately, I reported how\u00a0fake job emails are being used to install crypto mining software that slows down computers. Now, they are using Microsoft Teams chat to trick people.",
      "It usually starts with an email about a job followed by a suggestion to do the interview over Teams. The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number. Some victims are even asked to buy equipment for the job, pay a hiring fee or purchase gift cards, which are classic signs that the whole thing is a scam.",
      "A woman working on her Microsoft laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Microsoft Teams",
      "1) Avoid opening suspicious links and attachments: Be cautious of unsolicited links or attachments, especially in chat messages or emails. Cybercriminals often use these to deliver malware or phishing links. Never click on links that seem unusual or come from unknown sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",
      "ENERGY-SAVING SCAM USES ELON MUSK\u2019S NAME \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE TRUTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers and hackers are not slowing down, so staying sharp is the only way to stay ahead. If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

For example, Uber stores your location data to help you find a ride faster, while WhatsApp requires access to your contacts so you can send messages.",
      "The real issue is data collection that serves no purpose other than showing you ads or selling your information to third parties.

      "What makes this concerning is how deeply embedded these apps are in our daily lives, making it nearly impossible to find alternatives or avoid data collection altogether.",
      "The list also includes Elon Musk\u2019s X at No. 5, followed by Uber Eats, PayPal, Uber, Google and Amazon Prime Video. TikTok, despite ongoing scrutiny over its data policies, ranks 14th.

      "If you\u2019re not able to delete the apps listed above, follow the simple steps below to minimize how much information is being collected and shared.",
      "1. Review app permissions:\u00a0Most apps request access to data they do not actually need. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. Disable access to location, microphone, contacts and other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.",
      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",
      "While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",

      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone.

Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",

      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

The group's stated mission is to combat the targeting of immigrants for mass imprisonment and deportation.",

Since they don't have a warrant, they need to get your consent in order to enter they either want to deceive you into thinking that they're not ICE or they lie so that you've come to believe that they do have a right to enter or they want to intimidate or scare you so that you don't want to assert your rights.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has received approval from the Labor Department to use software that could allow it to transfer vast amounts of data out of Labor\u2019s systems, according to records seen by NBC News and interviews with two employees.",
      "The approval for Musk\u2019s team to use the remote-access and file-transfer software, known as PuTTY, has alarmed some of the Labor Department\u2019s career employees. Musk, the head of DOGE, has dispatched subordinates throughout the government to radically overhaul or dismantle federal agencies with the backing of President Donald Trump.",
      "Many of the details around DOGE\u2019s actions have remained secret, though it has moved to gain access to large swaths of data held in the computer systems of individual agencies.",
      "That access has become contentious, and a federal judge issued a restraining order Saturday temporarily forbidding DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive Treasury data, a case that does not involve the Labor Department. Democrats, labor unions and privacy advocates have filed lawsuits trying to halt data access at other government offices. Their concerns include the alleged use of artificial intelligence to analyze federal data and the alleged use of a computer server not familiar to government employees.",
      "Transferring government data outside established protocols could have high stakes for anyone whose information is in those databases, because of the chance that more people would have access to their information than originally intended, increasing chances of a breach.",
      "After the Labor Department approved DOGE to use PuTTY last week, the two department employees said that access was put on hold, at least temporarily, because of a lawsuit filed by several federal labor unions. NBC News was not able to determine whether Musk\u2019s subordinates at DOGE had already used the software or transferred any data, but the possibility was enough to spark concern within the Labor Department about the security of sensitive information, the two employees said.",
      "The two employees said that they considered the authorization to be a red flag because the DOGE members were new arrivals who, in their view, lacked sufficient vetting and experience for the access they were getting.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know who they are, and we\u2019re giving them free rein to extract whatever they want,\u201d one employee said. \u201cThis is completely opposite of what we\u2019d do to protect privacy.\u201d",
      "When reached for comment, a White House spokesperson did not directly answer questions about the software access but said that those working with Musk were doing so in full compliance with federal law, with appropriate security clearances and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisers.",
      "The Labor Department\u2019s press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "PuTTY is an open-source application that has been freely available for decades. Some technologists, including in government agencies, use it routinely in their jobs as a tool not only to transfer files but also to access computers remotely.",
      "But government departments tightly control who may install and use the app on office machines because there are strict rules and laws about the security of federal data, the two Labor Department employees said. In general, people who want to use PuTTY or other controlled software must seek permission from system administrators to ensure their use would comply with security rules, they said.",
      "The two Labor Department employees said that five DOGE workers were approved to use two pieces of software: PuTTY, commonly used for large file transfers, and an SQL studio program, used for editing and exploring certain databases.",
      "According to records seen by NBC News, the five people were: Sam Beyda, Derek Geissler, Cole Killian, Adam Ramada and Jordan Wick. Ramada identified himself as a DOGE employee in a sworn declaration in federal court last week, and Killian has been identified as a DOGE employee by news organizations, including NBC News. Wired magazine reported Saturday that Wick is affiliated with DOGE. The names of Beyda and Geissler have not been previously reported as working for either DOGE or the Trump administration.",
      "NBC News sent emails to DOGE email addresses and others with those names and did not receive responses. The White House declined to provide further information about the five people.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 50 electronic systems that include a diverse array of personally identifiable information, according to the department\u2019s chief information officer. The systems hold data for offices such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks the health of the economy; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, which enforces workplace rules; and the Employment and Training Administration, which provides billions of dollars in grant money annually, including to community colleges and apprenticeship programs. It is unclear which, if any, Labor Department databases the DOGE employees sought access to.",
      "Ramada, one of the DOGE employees, wrote in his court declaration last week that he and his colleagues would comply with all data security and privacy rules. He submitted the declaration in opposition to a proposed temporary restraining order, and he said he was one of three DOGE employees detailed to the Labor Department.",
      "\u201cUSDS employees detailed to the Department of Labor are required to be familiar with the legal rules governing access to Department of Labor data systems and are required to comply with those rules,\u201d he wrote. (USDS stands for United States DOGE Service.)",
      "He also pledged to follow rules related to sharing data.",
      "\u201cTo the extent USDS-Department of Labor detailees wish to share information garnered during their work duties within the Executive Branch, they are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He did not say in the declaration why DOGE would need to share data elsewhere within the executive branch. He said DOGE\u2019s overall goal was \u201cto inform policy decisions.\u201d",
      "Musk has said that DOGE needs access to federal data in order to search for waste, fraud and abuse. He has also said that his office doesn\u2019t have any personal data of Americans \u2014 an assertion that has been met by skepticism among government workers and Democrats in Congress.",
      "The Washington Post reported last week that DOGE had fed sensitive data from the Education Department into artificial intelligence software to examine the agency\u2019s programs and spending, and citing two people familiar with the project, Wired magazine reported that DOGE was developing an AI chatbot about spending across the government. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting.",
      "The Labor Department\u2019s databases likely include information about Musk\u2019s own companies such as SpaceX and Tesla, both of which have been subjects of publicly reported OSHA inspections, as well as about companies that compete with Musk\u2019s. Neither SpaceX nor Tesla responded to a request for comment on the potential for a conflict of interests. SpaceX has defended its safety record by pointing to training that it calls extensive, according to a 2023 investigation by Reuters into injuries at the company. Tesla has said its goal \u201cis to become the world\u2019s safest company by continuously integrating safety into the way we work.\u201d",
      "DOGE employees turned their attention to the Labor Department last week, after previously causing upheaval at several federal offices, including the Treasury Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Simon Tatham, a British coder who created PuTTY, said he wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that DOGE employees might be using his software. The app is available to anyone under a creative-commons license, and it\u2019s one of many apps that could be used to transfer data. He said it\u2019s up to U.S. authorities to enforce data security laws if anyone violates them.",
      "Whether DOGE\u2019s access to certain federal databases should be prohibited is now before U.S. District Judge John Bates, who\u2019s hearing the lawsuit filed last week in Washington, D.C., by several labor unions. On Friday, Bates ruled against a request by the plaintiffs for a temporary restraining order, finding that they did not have legal standing to sue.",
      "Bates wrote, though, that he \u201charbors concerns about defendants\u2019 alleged conduct.\u201d He ordered additional briefing in the case, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint Tuesday naming other defendants, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The plaintiffs say that the Labor Department\u2019s systems contain personally identifiable information about employees and others, as well as classified information.",
      "\u201cThese employees face irreparable harm to their privacy interests if this information is improperly accessed or disseminated (such as by being downloaded to a private server). Once the information is improperly accessed and/or disseminated, recovery may be difficult, and information may already have been used for impermissible purposes,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit doesn\u2019t mention specific software programs, but it asks the court to direct the government \u201cto remove any software installed by DOGE personnel on agency systems.\u201d",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in response to the lawsuit that any allegations about transferring data were speculative.",
      "\u201cWhether or not a particular effort to share specific types of information is lawful will depend upon the statutes and regulations that govern the use of those systems,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cThere is no basis for concluding, at this juncture, that any violation of the Privacy Act is forthcoming.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 01:56:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Apple and Google have made TikTok available on their U.S. app stores again, they said Thursday evening.",
    "story": [
      "Apple and Google have made TikTok available on their U.S. app stores again, they said Thursday evening.",
      "TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance, disappeared from both stores in the United States on Jan. 18, hours before a ban on the social media app was set to go into effect.",
      "It had remained unavailable to download on both Apple's App Store and Google's Play store until Thursday. However, users who had previously downloaded it could continue to use it.",
      "Google and Apple did not comment Thursday evening beyond saying the app was available.",
      "The ban, which is rooted in national security concerns, was the result of a law President Joe Biden signed in April that mandated that ByteDance sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or be blocked in the United States on Jan. 19.",
      "After a number of appeals, the Supreme Court upheld the law on Jan. 17, paving the way for it to shut down in the country.",
      "Days before he left office, Biden's administration said it would leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, which was set to take office Jan. 20.",
      "TikTok restored service to the United States on Jan. 19 after having blocked it the night before, saying it had done so based on pledges from incoming President Donald Trump to save the app. Trump had indicated that he would sign an executive order \"to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"",
      "\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "After it restored service last month, TikTok thanked \"President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive\" in a statement that said it would work with the White House to find a long-term solution.",
      "The status of the law \u2014 and the app's ownership \u2014\u00a0remains up in the air.",
      "Before the Jan. 19 declaration that the law would not yet take effect, Trump had floated enacting a provision of the law that says the president can issue a one-time extension of 90 days before it would take effect, but only \"if the President certifies to Congress that ... a path to executing a qualified divestiture has been identified\" and if there is \"evidence of significant progress toward executing such qualified divestiture has been produced.\"",
      "Since the 90-day extension was never officially put into place, TikTok's future in the United States remains somewhat open-ended, as Trump presumably hammers out the details to keep it alive in the country.",
      "Both Trump and Biden appeared to ping-pong on their opinions about whether the Chinese-owned app should be available in the United States.",
      "Trump was once at the forefront of the fight to ban it.",
      "\"As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,\" he\u00a0told reporters in July 2020. \"I can do it with an executive order or that.\"",
      "On Aug. 6, 2020, he\u00a0signed\u00a0an executive order\u00a0seeking to ban TikTok after 45 days. The order faced legal challenges, and TikTok won an injunction against it in late September. When Biden took office four months later, he reversed the order.",
      "Biden also appeared to go back and forth on his stance, putting the onus back on Trump after he offered his signature on the law that ultimately paved the way for the app to be banned.",
      "The idea to ban the app, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, stemmed from concern over how it collected users' data and whether its Chinese owner was a threat to national security."

The driver, a member of the fire department, escaped with minor injuries after the large debris flow along Big Rock Road swept the vehicle into the ocean around 5 p.m., a fire spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:18:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Many public health experts said their fears were realized Thursday when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as health and human services secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Many public health experts said their fears were realized Thursday when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as health and human services secretary.",
      "Kennedy, who has a background in environmental law, is the founder of a prominent anti-vaccine activist group that has bought numerous lawsuits against federal health agencies. He has also written several books questioning the safety and effectiveness of routine vaccinations.",
      "Only one Republican member of the GOP-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted alongside Democrats in unanimously opposing Kennedy\u2019s confirmation. In a statement, McConnell, a polio survivor, pointed to Kennedy\u2019s \u201crecord of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions.\u201d",
      "At Senate hearings last month, Kennedy said his priority as HHS Secretary would be to reverse rising rates of chronic diseases in the U.S., such as diabetes, cancer, asthma and obesity.",
      "Public health experts said they agreed with that goal broadly, but felt that having Kennedy at the helm of the country\u2019s largest and most powerful health agency would do more harm than good.",
      "The HHS secretary oversees a $1.7 trillion annual budget and 13 agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Experts worried that Kennedy could appoint vaccine skeptics to key roles within those agencies, set impossible-to-meet standards for vaccine approvals and decline to continue stockpiling the H5N1 vaccines that may be necessary in the event of a bird flu pandemic.",
      "Kennedy has also expressed interest in pausing research on infectious diseases like Covid and measles for the next eight years, which experts said could further prevent scientists from being prepared for future pandemics.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for America\u2019s children, and for the health of our nation, when a science denialist and anti-vaccine activist is chosen to head HHS,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "A representative for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, applauded his confirmation on Thursday.",
      "\u201cBobby richly deserves this honor, and CHD is confident that he will make great strides toward the goals he has set for HHS: radical transparency, gold-standard science and making America healthy again,\u201d Mary Holland, the group\u2019s CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Kennedy faced intense scrutiny from Democratic senators at his confirmation hearings last month for past statements linking childhood vaccines to autism, referring to Lyme disease as a military bioweapon and claiming that HPV vaccines increase the risk of cervical cancer \u2014 all of which are not supported by science.",
      "Ahead of the hearings, hundreds of scientists and health professionals released a public letter opposing Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "\u201cHis unfounded, fringe beliefs could significantly undermine public health practices across the country and around the world,\u201d they wrote.",
      "After questioning Kennedy on his anti-vaccine positions during a hearing, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with how to vote. But Cassidy, a doctor, ultimately voted to confirm Kennedy last week after what he described as \u201cvery intense conversations\u201d over the weekend.",
      "Several public health experts said their concerns weren\u2019t allayed by Kennedy\u2019s comments at the hearings, even after he said he would support the CDC\u2019s recommended vaccination schedule.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what he may have said during his confirmation hearings, I\u2019m way more comfortable looking at his track record over his entire career as an anti-vaccine advocate, and that\u2019s what I imagine he will do as an HHS Secretary,\u201d said Andrew Kelly, associate professor of public health at California State University, East Bay.",
      "Kelly said he became particularly concerned about the confirmation after the Trump administration temporary froze federal funding and instituted sweeping layoffs across federal health agencies.",
      "\u201cThe idea of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS secretary is actually more concerning or terrifying than it was even three weeks ago, particularly because the administration in the short three weeks has shown itself to be comfortable with violating the Constitution,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "He worried that Kennedy may be allowed to withhold money from schools that have vaccine requirements or could appoint anti-vaccine advocates to the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "Dr. Syra Madad, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said that under previous administrations, career scientists within federal agencies were a safeguard against political influence.",
      "\u201cThe past two weeks in America, it just seems like we\u2019re living in a twilight zone, and I no longer understand if we have those guardrails in place or how effective they are,\u201d Madad said.",
      "Even with constitutional limits on his authority as HHS secretary, Kennedy could still encourage vaccine skepticism by virtue of his new platform, said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe director of HHS is one of the most visible faces of public health in America,\u201d Motta said. \u201cTo have somebody who is skeptical of mainstream science in so many important ways sends a signal that these are positions that are mainstream, that are acceptable.\u201d",
      "However, Motta pointed to a few \u201csilver linings in the dark cloud that hangs over public health right now\u201d \u2014 among them, Kennedy\u2019s emphasis on chronic disease research and willingness to challenge corporate influence over food and drug industries.",
      "Other experts said it was hard to muster any optimism after Thursday\u2019s vote.",
      "\u201cHis placement at the top of our broader health system just encourages more disinformation, more misinformation, more vaccine skepticism, more anti-vax advocacy, and does so much damage that I can\u2019t even see a silver lining,\u201d Kelly, the associate professor, said."

    "story": [
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected a request to extradite a doctor who was charged with prescribing abortion pills online to a Louisiana resident last month.",
      "\"I will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana, not now, not ever,\u201d Hochul said at a news conference Thursday after her office received the order for the abortion provider, Dr. Margaret Carpenter.",
      "NBC News obtained a copy of the extradition warrant, which Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one right answer in this situation, and it is that this doctor must face extradition to Louisiana, where she can stand trial and justice will be served,\u201d Landry said in a video statement Thursday.",
      "A grand jury in West Baton Rouge Parish District Court indicted Carpenter last month along with her company, Nightingale Medical, and the Louisiana mother who ordered the pills online for her child, a pregnant minor. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",
      "The case is the first known criminal indictment of a doctor\u2019s being charged with sending abortion pills across state lines after Roe v. Wade was overturned. The indictment could also be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are meant to protect providers who prescribe and ship abortion medication to states where abortion is outlawed.",
      "West Baton Rouge District Attorney Tony Clayton previously told NBC News that \u201cif the same thing happens again, I\u2019m going to prosecute again. I hope this is going to have a chilling effect on [Dr. Carpenter] and anyone else to stop sending the pills to my state.\"",
      "After the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, Louisiana's near-total abortion ban, which does not allow exceptions for rape or incest, went into effect. If they are convicted of performing illegal abortions, including with medication, physicians face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical licenses.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York. Doctors take an oath to protect their patients. I took an oath of office to protect all New Yorkers, and I will uphold not only our constitution, but also the laws of our land,\u201d Hochul said.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also sued Carpenter in December alleging she sent abortion pills to that state; however, that case did not include criminal charges.",
      "After Carpenter was indicted, Hochul signed another piece of legislation allowing abortion providers to use the names of their practices instead of their own names on prescription labels."

      "After a few seconds in the water, Adri\u00e1n managed to reach his father\u2019s kayak and was quickly assisted. Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured.",

      "In the latest episode of \u201cFound,\u201d fans finally receive an answer to one of the biggest questions that has stumped them since the show premiered: How did Gabi and Sir\u2019s twisted partnership begin?",
      "Season 2, Episode 12, out Feb. 13, flashes back to the moment Gabi, played by Shanola Hampton, and Sir, portrayed by Mark-Paul Gosselaar, came face to face about 20 years after he kidnapped her. Viewers see Gabi intend to kill Sir, hoping to end her years of suffering and fear, before he changes her mind. He pitches that the two collaborate on her M&A cases, allowing their toxic, unbreakable bond to continue.",
      "A majority of the episode, titled \"Missing While Misidentified,\" is set in the past while in the present, both Gabi and Sir are arrested and questioned separately by the police.",
      "\u201cThis is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show,\u201d Hampton tells TODAY.com in an interview.",
      "She adds, \u201cTo see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it.\u201d",
      "Gosselaar says the episode also digs deeper into the psychology behind Sir\u2019s attachment to Gabi.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \u2018Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\u2019 So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212,\u201d he shares.",
      "Below, the two stars unpack all the secrets that were revealed in Season 2, Episode 12 in a joint interview with TODAY.com \u2014 and why Sir and Gabi's relationship is a dynamic \"we have not seen play out on television before.\"",
      "Gosselaar: It\u2019s been lovely. This has been just a great season. The fact that I don\u2019t have to be in the same room as you for so many hours.",
      "Hampton: That\u2019s what I was going to say, too. You know how you go on \"Love Is Blind\" and you want to switch your answer to \"no\" after they say \"No\" (at the altar)?",
      "Gosselaar: Honestly, I do enjoy the scenes that Sir has with Gabrielle in Episode 212 \u2014 we go back to the origin. It\u2019s fun to watch the dynamic between the two characters. And there\u2019s just so much going on, right? So it\u2019s fun to shoot and it\u2019s fun to watch.",
      "Hampton: I make no secret that I get to work with wonderful actors on this show. But my scenes with Mark-Paul, they lift me. And when he\u2019s there and he\u2019s present, on a personal level, it lifts me. So, not having as much interaction this season was really a bit of a shock to my system, because I got so used to it Season 1. I relied on those days as an escape day for me, and so not having that was quite an adjustment. Truthfully, that\u2019s how I feel about it. And hopefully in Season 3 we will be back on the screen together a lot!",
      "Gosselaar: How did it happen? I think that\u2019s a big question of the first season. How did she abduct Sir? Why is he in her basement? Somebody had to help. Who helped her? All those questions get answered. And for us, as fans of our show, that was fun to read and fun to do. We always end on a cliffhanger. That\u2019s by design. The next script for us, we just can\u2019t wait to get into it. So we\u2019re sort of mirroring what the audience is going through, just in a different way.",
      "Hampton: This is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show. To be able to answer some of the questions from Season 1 in this episode, to see the mindset, to play the dynamics and the nuances of dealing with Margaret (Kelli Williams) while making this choice, and to see Dhan\u2019s (Karan Oberoi) part in it. All of these things where it just was so juicy to me. To see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it. I like seeing Gabi here, because I think the audience gets to really go on the ride that she went through in a real way.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s telling to the psychological damage that one does to the victim and how hard it is to break the cycle. Our central theme is not to judge people\u2019s healing process. People are so quick to say, \"Just block them, girl! Don\u2019t talk to him anymore!\" Everybody has advice until they\u2019re there. Now, she can search why and really heal so that when she does press block, if that time ever comes, it\u2019s out of a place of healing. That was really a telling moment, I think, for Gabi, for me as the actor playing Gabi, and for the audience to see, \"Oh, this goes way deeper than we even think.\"",
      "Gosselaar: I just think it reinforced that a lot of the time that Sir is there by choice. That\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \"Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\" So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212.",
      "Hampton: Sick. It\u2019s an obsession of sorts. There\u2019s no real definition. We\u2019ve not really seen this dynamic play out on television before. So to have it not be a sexual chemistry or him wanting to marry her, wifey her up \u2014 you just see him wanting a life with her. So it\u2019s weird.",
      "Gosselaar: There\u2019s so many things. We don\u2019t choose family, so I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s why he uses that word. That even years can go by and because you have the bond of family, it\u2019s an unbreakable bond. So I think he\u2019s very particular in the words that he chooses. But \"family\" is deep and it\u2019s really dark. I guess that\u2019s what people come to our show for.",
      "Hampton: Well, it shows that it\u2019s going to be a disconnect. This means a lot less time of them being in the same room. Gabi (is) putting a line in the sand, saying, \"I\u2019m not giving into his manipulation.\" It sets up the next several episodes of what the dynamic is going to be with Sir and Gabi.",
      "Gosselaar: We\u2019re just going to see moments where the lack of control is going to eat at him. You\u2019re just going to see him do everything in his power to connect.",
      "Gosselaar: We have a great group of actors, very talented. There\u2019s a few stinkers. Actually, just one. But I won\u2019t name names, because that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other actors. We are a very ambitious show. We\u2019ve said this before: we have 44 minutes to tell a story, and this story is just packed with plot and characters. It was very difficult to get this all on screen. We did, and we have just an unbelievable crew that works their butt off every single day of our show for the nine months that we\u2019re filming. So my hat goes off to them. We have great writers and everyone working behind us and all the actors. It is truly a collaboration that couldn\u2019t be done with one of the parts missing. Thankfully we don\u2019t have any parts missing, and it just makes for a great show. I hope we can continue with Season 3. Maybe I\u2019ll just have to have a conversation with that actor that was slowing things down.",
      "Hampton: That actor says that she has in her contract not to speak to her or look her in the eyes, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. (laughs)",
      "Hampton: It\u2019s awful. So what people don\u2019t understand is that Mark-Paul is the lead on this show, but he doesn\u2019t work. So it\u2019s one day a week, which means I only have to stomach him one day. When he\u2019s directing, he\u2019s gotta prep. His presence is there. He has to direct all eight days. You know what eight days is like being with Mark-Paul? No, it was amazing.",
      "Gosselaar: Actually, I was there for a lot longer. We went through a hurricane together. I was there for three weekends. I was like, \"What is going on here? I\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life!\"",
      "Hampton: What I\u2019ll say about Mark-Paul as a director, and this is for future projects as well, what you\u2019re going to get is someone who is intellectually prepared, technically prepared, but also able to be really chill when things need to change. He has so much experience on set. He is a leader of not only the cast but the crew. He commands trust on day one, and he\u2019s a joy. I mean, he is a stick in the mud. And yes, you would think he\u2019s boring and a jerk. But he\u2019s actually super funny, and people enjoy being around him. I\u2019m not one of those people. He is one of the five directors that I would work with for the rest of my career and be happy.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s that they thought they were just going to get another procedural, and then there was a man in the basement. You start the ride and you cannot get off, because you have to see what\u2019s going to happen with these two characters while serving the communities who are underserved. So I think that\u2019s where the connection has happened.",
      "Gosselaar: I agree. I like how you started that off. Because it\u2019s like the audience thought they were just going to get Shanola, and then they got Mark-Paul Gosselaar.",
      "Hampton: (laughs) Not what I said, Sir!",
      "Gosselaar: Pretty much. You said the procedural and then you were, like, \"Then the guy in the basement.\" I totally agree with that.",
      "Hampton: I mean, how many Critics Choice nominations did you get before working with me? You\u2019re welcome.",
      "Gosselaar: Same as you. (laughs)",

The season was divided into three parts, the first of which hit Netflix July 18, 2024.",

      "While both the film and show wrapped around the same time, according to Macchio, \"Cobra Kai\" co-creator Josh Heald previously told TODAY.com the new \"Karate Kid\" film had no effect on the writing of Season Six.",
      "\"It didn't impact it at all,\" Heald said. \"We're telling our story that is finishing the story we set out to tell when we began Season One production back in 2017. And this is the ultimate realization of that story.\"",
      "Heald also clarified to ScreenRant that while \"Cobra Kai\" Season Six \"doesn\u2019t set up the movie,\" the character of Daniel is \"the piece that does tie\" the two projects.",

      "Ahead of \"Cobra Kai\" Season Six, Part Three's premiere on Feb. 13, Ralph Macchio told TODAY.com that \"Karate Kid: Legends\" \"takes place a few years after the events of 'Cobra Kai.'\"",
      "\"We land Daniel LaRusso in 'Cobra Kai' in a way that when we see him in 'Karate Kid: Legends,' it makes sense that that's where he is. And then we through line little things he says that make sense from what we saw on 'Cobra Kai,' without it being a continuation of 'Cobra Kai,'\" Macchio said.",

      "\"We don\u2019t look at it that way. It\u2019s sort of like, see you later,\" Macchio said. \"Because this franchise does not give up, just like Cobra Kai never dies and neither do these characters. So we\u2019ll see what\u2019s next up around the bend.\"",

Inside, he finds boxing gloves, a passport, a piece of fabric and a newspaper clipping with the headline \"Police search for assailant,\" dated to 1947. The passport features a photo of Mr. Miyagi next to the name Keisuke Miyagi, rather than Nariyoshi, the first name Daniel knew him to have.

      "In the last scene of Episode 5, Daniel realizes the significance of the headband. After Miyagi-Do qualifies for an international karate tournament in Barcelona, the Sekai Taikai, Daniel realizes the fabric matches the headbands awarded to team captains. The moment implies that Mr. Miyagi has a history at the Sekai Taikai, sending Daniel on a mission to learn more about his mentor's past \u2014\u00a0and all of its dark twists and turns.",
      "\"He\u2019s kind of chasing the past instead of focusing on the present, let alone the future, for his students and everyone else,\" Macchio told TODAY.com.",

      "\"In Part Two, it\u2019s the deepest and darkest dive for him that gets him a bit in trouble,\" Macchio added.",
      "Once the Miyagi-Do crew arrives in Barcelona for the Sekai Taikai, Daniel starts asking organizers if they recognize Mr. Miyagi's headband. In Episode 6, a woman representing the company that makes the tournament's official apparel tells Daniel that Miyagi's headband was likely from the \"1950s era, maybe even 1940s,\" meaning Mr. Miyagi was likely involved in the Sekai Taikai after World War II.",

      "The scene required the use of special effects and artificial intelligence to pull it off, \"Cobra Kai\" co-creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg\u00a0told Deadline in November.",
      "\"There\u2019s a combination of practical and digital and artificial technologies that come together to make it happen,\" Heald said. \"There\u2019s a real stand-in performer for that moment. There\u2019s some digital design, like mapping of faces that happens and using artificial intelligence for all that, especially when it comes to voicing.\"",
      "Hurwitz added that the idea of bringing Mr. Miyagi back started with a conversation with Macchio and with Morita's estate.",
      "\"If we were going to do this, we had to do it the right way by getting involved with (Morita\u2019s) estate and making sure they were comfortable with it. We also contacted one of Pat\u2019s daughters with whom we have a relationship,\" Hurwitz said. \"Ralph spoke with her about the scene to ensure everyone was on board and felt good about what we were doing.\"",

Suddenly, masked figures wearing skeleton costumes, just like the ones worn by Johnny and company on Halloween in \"The Karate Kid\" fight scene that started it all, swarm Daniel's backyard. As he prepares to fight them off, Mr. Miyagi arrives to defend his student, and the duo beat the masked figures together.",
      "After, a tearful Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi why he didn't tell him about his history with the Sekai Taikai.",

      "The next morning, when Sam tells her dad that she doesn't want to fight in the tournament, Daniel passes on Mr. Miyagi's lesson. He ultimately decides to let Miyagi-Do's fighters gracefully leave the Sekai Taikai, allowing Johnny to return to Cobra Kai and lead it to victory.",
      "\"When I asked Mr. Miyagi to train me, I thought it was to fight. And then I learned maybe the most important lesson he ever taught me,\" Daniel says. \"I was training so I wouldn't have to fight. You're not giving up. You figured out something that I forget too often: The greatest victory karate can bring to you is not having to fight at all.\"",
      "Macchio told TODAY.com the dream sequence represents a scene with Mr. Miyagi he's long wanted to create.",

      "During Season 22 in 1996, Whitney Houston appeared in one of the popular Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches on \u201cSNL\u201d when she served as that episode's musical guest, but Molly Shannon, who famously portrayed the nervous Catholic schoolgirl on the classic comedy show, says the late pop star almost missed out.",
      "\u201cI wanted Whitney in the Mary Katherine Gallagher sketch,\u201d Shannon told TODAY on Feb. 13. \u201cIt was a Christmas sketch with Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Penny Marshall, and they said, \u2018You\u2019re never going to get Whitney Houston. She\u2019s not going to be in a Mary Katherine Gallagher sketch.\u2019 \u2018No, I\u2019ll get her. I\u2019ll get her.\u2019",

We\u2019ve had highs and lows and all the moments in between,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ve loved, we\u2019ve danced, we\u2019ve chased dreams, faced heartbreaks and celebrated wins. We\u2019ve grown up together, the world changed and so did we.",
      "\u201cAlong the way, we\u2019ve learned the most important lesson of all: to cherish every moment,\u201d they continued. \u201cThat is the power of music. It unites us. It heals us. It inspires us and it motivates us. Music brings back memories and creates new ones. It\u2019s generational. It reminds us where we came from and where we\u2019re going. So here\u2019s to 20 years of life, to road trips, to friendships, to love, the moments that have changed us and the ones we\u2019ll never forget.\u201d"

      "On Feb. 9, prebiotic soda brand Poppi was among the brands with commercials during Super Bowl 59. It\u2019s not the ad, \u201cSoda Thoughts,\u201d which stars influencers Alix Earle, Jake Shane and Rob Rausch, that\u2019s at the center of the controversy \u2014 but the marketing campaign leading up to it.",
      "Ahead of the ad\u2019s debut, Poppi sent branded vending machines to 32 separate influencers, including Shane, Rachel Sullivan, Kaeli Mae, Rachel Gaede, Avery Woods, Emilie Kiser and Vidya Gopalan.",
      "The influencers posted videos about these gargantuan gifts on TikTok, racking up millions of views, but unfortunately for the soda brand, the public\u2019s reaction to the activation was as ice-cold as the soda stocked in the machines.",

      "Meanwhile, Olipop has been taking the opportunity to poke fun at its competitor, parroting the criticism others are sharing. But, aside from its jokes, Olipop also made a claim about how much the soda machines cost, which the rest of the internet has decided to run with.",
      "\u201calso for the record, those machines cost $25K each lol,\u201d Olipop commented on a video.",

      "Poppi responds to the criticism",
      "Poppi says it owns the machines and they were never intended for one-time use, so all the influencers who received them will have to return them.",

      "\u201cAs our beloved community has always been at the forefront of the poppi brand, these machines will be rolling out to them via events, social giveaways & nominations in the weeks to come,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cDespite false comments from our competitors, we are focused on revolutionizing soda for the next generation and can\u2019t wait for you all to see what\u2019s next.\u201d",
      "Then, on Feb. 10, Allison Ellsworth, Poppi\u2019s co-founder and chief brand officer, posted a TikTok addressing the drama.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing a lot of negativity, and so I wanted to get on here and chat with you guys directly,\u201d Ellsworth says. \u201cFirst of all, I want to say, I hear you, and there\u2019s a lot of misinformation being spread out there by one of our competitors, from our plans to the price tag of 25K, which is not what it costs and that is not true.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of the things that has made Poppi so successful is that we listen to you and our community, we can always learn and do better,\u201d she continues later in the clip. \u201cThese vending machines will be a part of the brand for years to come, and we want to work with you guys to get them out to the places you\u2019d like to see them out in the world.\u201d",

      "\u201cGive us small creators a chance!\u201d another user pleaded.",
      "\u201cMore #diverse creators,\u201d someone else suggested.",
      "Others suggested places worthy of receiving the vending machines, such as homeless shelters, school break rooms, hospitals and libraries.",

    "summary": "An Israeli police raid on the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech in the city.",
    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",
      "\u201cIn our book, anyone from any religion, from any side, can say his opinion without being afraid. He can discuss any kind of thing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn the west side of Jerusalem, there are English bookstores that have the same books that we have, and you will never hear that they arrested the owners,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "HASAKAH, Syria \u2014 In a network of prisons and detention camps across northeastern Syria, the Islamic State militant group has an army in waiting, and fanatical support for its brutal regime lives on.",
      "For now the prisons and camps are guarded by the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led fighting force that battled alongside the U.S. military to destroy ISIS\u2019 so-called caliphate.",
      "The Islamist group\u2019s radical ideology was never fully defeated, and after the ouster of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad late last year, as well as the arrival of a new administration in Washington, some are fearful that ISIS could be unleashed on the world once again.",
      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",
      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",
      "Among them is Ibrahim, a Moroccan national who admitted in an interview with NBC News late last month that he was an ISIS fighter but insisted that he was no longer a threat.",
      "\u201cIf I were dangerous, I would not have surrendered myself,\u201d said Ibrahim, who declined to give his last name. \u201cI just want to go back to my county.\u201d",
      "Imprisoned for six years, he is one of the many foreign detainees whose home countries have failed to repatriate them.",
      "For the SDF commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, these prisoners are among the most dangerous. \u201cThey are hard-liners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have massive numbers in our prisons, and this constitutes an ongoing threat.\u201d",
      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",
      "'One of the most dangerous camps in the world'",
      "On a barren stretch of desert roadway, just 26 miles east of Hasakah, is the sprawling Al Hol Camp \u2014 home to around 40,000 people, 93% of whom are women and children, according to the most recent figures from the United Nations, published last February.",
      "Many of them are the families of ISIS fighters and SDF officials said the camp was considered a breeding ground for the next generation of militants.",
      "\u201cA mindset of radicalism is instilled in the residents,\u201d said Jihan Hanan, Al Hol\u2019s director. \u201cThey are only becoming more extreme.\u201d",
      "With limited resources, she said staff could guard only the perimeter, meaning violence was rife inside what she called \u201cone of the most dangerous camps in the world.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere have been murders inside, and some are armed with weapons,\u201d she said, adding that there were regular escape attempts.",
      "Inside the camp, in a section dubbed The Annex, the wives of foreign ISIS fighters and their children are held, around 6,000 people from 51 countries. Many of their governments have shown little or no interest in repatriating them in the six or so years they have languished in the camp.",
      "Considered by the SDF to hold the most extreme residents in the whole camp, The Annex is fenced off from the rest of the facility, with guard posts standing at the exit.",
      "Inside, wild dogs pick through piles of garbage, near trash-strewn muddy pathways and open sewers.",
      "Women gather together, all fully covered in the Islamic niqab, as hundreds of young children from strikingly diverse ethnic backgrounds wander through the squalor. There is little electricity or running water, and their patchwork plastic tents offer meager protection against Syria\u2019s winter chill.",
      "In another part of The Annex kids chant \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d while raising a single finger in the air, a trademark of ISIS. After hurling vulgar insults and threatening violence, they start to throw stones."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan, which is facing famine amid it's 2-year civil war.",
    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The fossil of a Jurassic bird unearthed in southeastern China has major implications for the history of avian evolution, researchers say.",
      "The newly discovered Baminornis zhenghensis, a quail-sized bird, roamed the skies some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, meaning it is among the oldest birds known to mankind, along with the iconic Archaeopteryx that was discovered in Germany in 1862 and is of similar age.",
      "\u201cFor more than 150 years now, Archaeopteryx has stood alone,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a University of Edinburgh paleontologist who wrote a commentary accompanying the study.",
      "\u201cDuring all of that time, it has remained as the only unquestionable bird fossil from the Jurassic Period,\u201d he told NBC News in an email.",
      "While there have been other birdlike Jurassic fossils found here and there, Brusatte said, there was a \u201chuge mystery and a frustrating gap\u201d in the fossil record: If Archaeopteryx was flying by then, other birds must have been too. So where were their fossils?",
      "The 2023 discovery of Baminornis in Zhenghe county in China\u2019s Fujian province, now among the most important discoveries since Archaeopteryx, helps fill that gap, he said, making it the \u201csecond unquestioned bird from the Jurassic Period.\u201d",
      "Min Wang, the lead author of the study, said it was a \"very exciting\" discovery.",
      "\u201cThese two fossil birds have systematically changed our understanding about the earliest evolution of birds,\" the paleontologist from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences told NBC News in an email.",
      "\"They demonstrate that the origin of birds is much earlier than current thought.\"",
      "Unlike the half-bird, half-reptile Archaeopteryx, which had a long and skinny tail similar to that of a velociraptor, Baminornis had a short tail with some of its vertebrae fused into a short, stubby nubbin called a\u00a0pygostyle \u2014 a crucial aerodynamic feature that pushes the body\u2019s center of mass toward the wings, similar to those in modern-day birds that help them fly better.",
      "Until the discovery of Baminornis, short tails had been found only in birds known to have lived around 20 million years later,\u00a0such as Eoconfuciusornis and Protopteryx.",
      "\u201cWhat excites me most is that it is a more advanced bird than Archaeopteryx, and it could fly much better,\u201d Brusatte said.",
      "Baminornis was much more anatomically complex than Archaeopteryx, which Brusatte said was a \u201cprimitive\u201d bird with claws and sharp teeth like its dinosaur ancestors.",
      "Archaeopteryx, which played a crucial role in determining that today\u2019s birds evolved from dinosaurs, was a \u201ctextbook example of a creature caught in the act of evolution like a freeze frame,\u201d he added.",
      "The vast difference between the two similarly aged birds, discovered about 5,500 miles apart, has led the team behind the Nature study to believe that avian evolution occurred millions of years earlier than previously thought, with the estimate now at about 164 to 172 million years ago.",
      "In addition to dozens of fossils of aquatic or semiaquatic animals, the Zhenghe Fauna collection, as it\u2019s referred to, includes at least three fossils so far that belong to the group including birds and their closest relatives. The researchers said this suggests the collection holds great potential to \u201cenrich our understanding of early bird diversification\u201d and \u201cfill a critical gap in the evolutionary history of terrestrial ecosystem\u201d toward the end of the Jurassic period.",
      "Though the Baminornis fossil preserved much of the skeleton, the feathers were not preserved, leaving unanswered questions about the size and structure of its wings. It was also missing the skull, limiting clues about the bird\u2019s diet.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cBaminornis tells us that a variety of birds lived during the Jurassic, and they flew in different ways,\u201d Brusatte said."

      "\"Let's say that he did take Ukraine and took it quickly. That wouldn't have reduced the outside world outrage, right?\" Boduszy\u0144ski said. \"But I guess in the end, the prize of taking Ukraine was bigger, bigger than\" the risk losing Olympic participation.",

      "\"I think that they thought that the conquest of Ukraine would be very quick and very successful and that any international resistance would blow over,\" Kent said. \"And in Olympic terms, [it would blow over] in time for 2024 or maybe the next [2026]. While I don't think it was their top issue, I do not think they expected international condemnation to be as strong as it was or that Ukrainian resistance to be what it's been.\""

      "Negotiations over prisoner swaps can be tough and the prices can be high, and experts warn that quickly giving hostage-takers the concessions they want gives them incentives for further kidnappings. But the immediate rewards are unambiguous: Americans, regardless of party, want their compatriots back.",
      "A trade executed Tuesday returned Marc Fogel to the United States after years of imprisonment in Russia in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, who pleaded guilty in the United States to money-laundering charges. Fogel, a teacher who was jailed for possessing marijuana he used to treat chronic pain, wore a U.S. flag across his shoulders as Trump greeted him at the White House on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s made bringing Americans home a top priority, and people respond to that,\u201d the U.S. special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cUsually, he\u2019ll empower his team. He\u2019ll say, \u2018I want this person out.\u2019 We come up with options. He approves them and then usually makes calls after\u201d to secure deals.",
      "With the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine looming and little apparent progress having been made toward ending the war, Trump's quiet move this week may soften Washington-Moscow relations. That, in turn, could help lay the groundwork for the deal Trump has promised to bring the hostilities in Europe to a close.",
      "\"The smartest thing you can do to curry favor with the president of the United States is bring Americans home,\" Boehler said. \"He's been clear about that.\"",
      "Administration officials would not disclose what, if anything, else Moscow may have gained in the negotiations beyond Vinnik\u2019s freedom. In the past, Russia has repeatedly refused to release detained Americans without receiving in return its citizens who are of top importance to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin insisted, for instance, on the release of a Russian assassin imprisoned in Germany as part of a prisoner swap President Joe Biden\u2019s administration negotiated last fall.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration traditionally has framed these victories as something that they got without giving anything up,\u201d said Dani Gilbert, an assistant professor of political science at Northwestern University who studies hostage negotiations. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for me to imagine a world in which the Trump administration\u2019s statements about Ukraine in the last 48 hours were not quid pro quo for Fogel\u2019s release.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the Trump administration outlined new parameters for a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine that are far more generous than any from the Biden administration. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth detailed the framework, which appeared to favor Putin\u2019s demands that Ukraine not recover all of its lost territory and that it not be admitted to NATO.",
      "Trump also held separate phone calls Wednesday with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and he tasked his top national security aides with negotiating an end to the war. Vice President JD Vance plans to meet with Zelenskyy this week on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich.",
      "Republicans in Congress, with Trump's support, cut off U.S. aid to Ukraine in 2023. Democrats warned that Trump would abandon Ukraine, handing Putin a long-sought victory. Trump has insisted that he secure a peace deal that does not reward Moscow.",
      "How it happened",
      "Trump assigned Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend who is his special envoy for the Middle East, to take the lead on engaging with the Russians about a deal for Fogel. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, U.S. officials have not engaged with Russian officials directly, except in rare cases of coordination between military leaders to avoid accidents in combat zones.",
      "Trump's blessing set off a flurry of secret discussions across multiple governments, some involving the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as an interlocutor, that culminated in Russia\u2019s release of Fogel, a schoolteacher in Pennsylvania. Witkoff chartered his private plane to Moscow to pick him up.",
      "\u201cI got a call that he was going to be at the airport,\u201d Witkoff said of Fogel on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I called the president. He was delighted. He said, \u2018Get over there fast.\u2019\u201d",
      "While the effort took a couple of weeks, the 72 hours preceding Fogel\u2019s release were the most critical, and events unfolded quickly.",
      "Around 5:40 p.m. Monday, Witkoff\u2019s plane took off from Dulles International Airport in Virginia, headed directly for Moscow.",
      "It was 2:30 a.m. in Moscow when Witkoff and two aides to Boehler touched down on the tarmac.",
      "U.S. officials were on the ground in western Russia for less than 11 hours, based on an analysis of the flight pattern of Witkoff\u2019s private plane.",
      "At the airport, they walked Fogel onto the aircraft. After they waited for the plane to de-ice, with Fogel on board, the flight took off from Moscow that evening en route to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. Fogel posed for a photograph holding a beverage and a cheese plate.",
      "Once the plane was out of Russian airspace, Fogel called his family. \u201cWe called everybody back in the United States,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cHe was doing a jig.\u201d",
      "Witkoff\u2019s portfolio now may expand to include U.S. efforts to broker a deal to end the war.",
      "\u201cWitkoff would do whatever the president asked of him,\u201d a White House official said.",
      "Partisan advantage",
      "Trump has secured the releases of 10 Americans held by foreign governments since he took office less than a month ago. That accomplishment has delivered him bipartisan plaudits amid a broader landscape of ideological warfare in the nation's capital. Trump is keenly aware of the political credit that comes with freeing detained Americans, and his White House pumped out a news release touting support for the deal from officials in both parties.",
      "\"Marc Fogel\u2019s return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said Tuesday on X as he expressed gratitude to Trump and Witkoff. \"I want to thank @POTUS and @SteveWitkoff for their efforts in finally bringing Marc home.\"",
      "At the same time, Trump and his aides have sought to turn the returns into a partisan advantage. For years, Trump leveled heavy criticism at Biden for the deals he secured. They included a swap that freed WNBA star Brittney Griner in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout and one in which the United States released $6 billion for Iran \u2014 and then blocked the money amid political blowback \u2014\u00a0in exchange for five Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed Biden for not having gotten Fogel out of Russia, creating a direct contrast between the two presidents.",
      "\"This is something that the Biden administration allegedly tried to do for 3\u00bd years,\" Leavitt said at her regular briefing with reporters. \"I think you all should go back and ask some of those Biden administration officials what they even tried to do, and why weren\u2019t they successful?

      "Former Biden administration officials welcomed the news that Fogel had been released but took major issue with the Trump team's characterization of hostage negotiations over the last four years.",
      "\"Trump left Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan in Russia. We got them out,\" a Biden administration national security official said. \"He left the Citgo 6 in Venezuela. We got them out. He left Mark Frerichs in Afghanistan. We got him out. He left multiple Americans in Iran. We got them home.\"",
      "More broadly, the Biden administration official said, \"We brought home dramatically more Americans than he did \u2014 and there were fewer unjustly detained Americans when we left office than when he left office\" the first time.",
      "First-term Trump administration officials defend their record, too.",
      "Edward McMullen, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland who was involved when the United States conducted a prisoner exchange with Iran during Trump's first term, said that not only has Trump made returning detained Americans a priority, but he is open to dialogue in a way others may resist.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t anything new. When the president was in his first term, he made it a priority to try and get every prisoner that was held illegally and under duress out of Iran, out of numerous countries where they were being held,\u201d McMullen said. \u201cThis is what it takes: a conversation, a recognition that dialogue does produce results, and that\u2019s where the president has that amazing success.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A New Jersey man whose wife was killed by a hippo during an African safari has filed a lawsuit alleging that their tour operator was negligent in failing to keep her safe.",
      "Craig Manders says in the suit that he witnessed the horrifying death of his wife Lisa, 70, who was killed in Zambia last year during a safari organized by a Connecticut company, African Portfolio.",
      "\u201cHad we understood the dangers posed by the hippopotamus, we never would have agreed to be in such close contact while on foot,\u201d Manders said in a statement released by his attorneys, Paul Slager and Nicole Coates.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we were unwittingly exposed to such an extreme danger, a danger made even worse by our tour guides leaving Lisa alone on foot with nothing between her and such a deadly animal, is nothing short of astonishing.\u201d",
      "Rod Gould, a lawyer for African Portfolio, described the incident as a terrible but \"really unusual\" tragedy. He said the company arranges tours and works with the most reputable safari lodges in Africa but is not responsible for what goes on during the trips.",
      "\"My client is a tour operator. It organizes tours,\" Gould said. \"A trip, for example, might include airfare. We're not responsible if the airline loses luggage.\"",
      "In the suit filed in Stamford Superior Court, Manders says he and his wife left the U.S. on May 31, 2024, for a 10-day safari in Zambia, a country in southern Africa.",
      "Five days later, the couple went on a \u201cbush walk\u201d with guides who led them to a riverbank where a lone hippopotamus was resting in the water, the suit says. Known for being fiercely territorial and aggressive, hippos are among the most dangerous animals on Earth.",
      "Despite their size \u2013 adult males typically weigh over 3,000 pounds \u2013 hippos can run fast over short distances, reaching speeds upward of 20 mph.",
      "The guides \u201cknew or should have known that the close presence of the wild hippopotamus to participants in the Bush Walk posed an immediate and extreme danger, due to the known tendencies of hippopotami to be highly unpredictable, territorial, and aggressive in such circumstances,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "But the guides, including at least one armed with a rifle, left the area, the suit says, leaving the Manders and others in their group to observe the hippo without any protection.",
      "Then, without warning, the hippo lifted its head and charged out of the water toward Lisa Manders, according to the lawsuit. The massive animal caught up with Manders and attacked her, the suit says.",
      "\u201cAlthough Lisa Manders attempted to flee, she was unable to escape and the hippopotamus violently attacked her, grabbing her by its mouth, lifting her off the ground, shaking her entire body, and crushing her head and body with its bite,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Lisa Manders suffered \u201ccatastrophic injuries\u201d and died shortly after, according to the lawsuit, which noted that her husband witnessed the attack.",
      "A mother of three from Cranford, Manders worked in the financial industry for more than 40 years. \u201cLisa was the best mother and wife anyone could ever hope for,\u201d her husband said. \u201cHer violent death is a devastating loss not only for our family, but for our community.\"",
      "The lawsuit does not identify where in Zambia the attack occurred, but the country\u2019s minister of tourism was quoted in a local news report lamenting the death of an American tourist killed by a hippo at the Lower Zambezi National Park on June 5, 2024.",
      "The government\u2019s \u201cthoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the deceased, even as investigations continue on the incident,\u201d the tourism minister, Rodney Sikumba, said in a statement, according to Radio Christian Voice.",
      "Craig Manders\u2019 attorneys described the incident as an awful tragedy that was \u201centirely preventable.\u201d",
      "\u201cInteracting with the natural world in the wilderness can be an incredibly rich experience,\u201d said Slager, of Slager Madry LLC. \u201cBut wilderness guides and tour operators like African Portfolio carry the responsibility to ensure basic safety precautions are taken to ensure customers visiting the African wilderness are not unnecessarily exposed to extreme dangers.\u201d"
